- en: We are finished with this book, but we only started with Kubernetes. It is so
    vast that no single book can cover even the core components. If we extend the
    scope to all the members of **Cloud Native Computing Foundation** (**CNCF**) ([https://www.cncf.io/](https://www.cncf.io/))
    project as well as third-party solutions that can be added, we'd need a series
    of books dedicated only to Kubernetes. To make things more complicated, the Kubernetes
    ecosystem is growing so fast that it is almost impossible to keep the pace. Even
    if we could somehow learn everything there is to know today, we would be left
    behind a week later.

  zh: 我们已经完成了这本书，但我们只刚刚开始接触 Kubernetes。它的范围如此广泛，单一本书甚至无法涵盖核心组件。如果我们将范围扩展到包括**云原生计算基金会**（**CNCF**）([https://www.cncf.io/](https://www.cncf.io/))项目中的所有成员以及可以添加的第三方解决方案，我们将需要一系列专门针对
    Kubernetes 的书籍。更复杂的是，Kubernetes 生态系统发展得如此迅速，几乎不可能跟得上其步伐。即使我们今天能够掌握所有知识，过一周后我们也会掉队。
- en: There is an almost infinite number of combinations we can use to create and
    use a Kubernetes cluster. We can choose to stick only with core components, or
    we can combine them with third-party tools. We could choose to use only "vanilla
    Kubernetes", or we can adopt one of the platforms like OpenShift ([https://www.openshift.com/](https://www.openshift.com/)),
    Docker Enterprise Edition ([https://www.docker.com/kubernetes#/EE](https://www.docker.com/kubernetes#/EE)),
    or [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) ([https://rancher.com/](https://rancher.com/)).
    There are many others we might want to explore, and the list is growing with each
    passing day.

  zh: 我们可以使用几乎无限的组合来创建和使用 Kubernetes 集群。我们可以选择仅使用核心组件，或者将它们与第三方工具结合。我们可以选择仅使用“原生 Kubernetes”，或者采用像
    OpenShift ([https://www.openshift.com/](https://www.openshift.com/))、Docker 企业版
    ([https://www.docker.com/kubernetes#/EE](https://www.docker.com/kubernetes#/EE))
    或 [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) ([https://rancher.com/](https://rancher.com/))
    这样的平台。还有很多其他我们可能想要探索的平台，而且随着时间的推移，选择的名单还在不断增长。
- en: Some of the Kubernetes platforms are highly opinionated while others force us
    to choose ourselves the components that'll constitute a cluster. We can easily
    spend eternity evaluating which components are the best for our use case. Take
    networking as an example. There are at least twenty solutions I know of, and I'm
    pretty sure that number can be multiplied by ten. You can easily get blocked only
    with that single choice. Add persistent storage, Ingress, and authentication to
    the mix and the amount of the things we need to evaluate is already beyond the
    capacity of a single person.

  zh: 一些 Kubernetes 平台具有高度的偏向性，而其他平台则迫使我们自己选择组成集群的组件。我们很容易在评估哪些组件最适合我们的用例时耗费大量时间。以网络为例，我知道至少有二十种解决方案，而且我非常确定这个数字可以增加十倍。仅仅这一单一选择就足以让你陷入困境。如果再加上持久存储、Ingress
    和身份验证，我们需要评估的内容已经超出了一个人能承受的范围。
- en: If we add hosting providers to the evaluation, we are faced with additional
    options and new constraints. Almost all realized by now that Kubernetes is going
    to be the norm and that it is paramount to adopt it to their offerings. They are
    all adding their own components to make Kubernetes work seamlessly on their infrastructure.
    They are trying to attract you by saying that Kubernetes works better there than
    anywhere else. That also means that you will face additional new components.

  zh: 如果我们将托管供应商纳入评估范围，就会面临更多的选项和新的限制。几乎所有人现在都意识到 Kubernetes 将成为标准，并且它对他们的产品至关重要，因此必须采用
    Kubernetes。他们都在为自己的基础设施添加组件，以使 Kubernetes 能够无缝运行。它们试图通过宣称 Kubernetes 在他们的环境中运行得比其他地方更好来吸引你。这也意味着，你将面临额外的新组件。
- en: Kubernetes is designed to be extensible. Almost every software and hosting vendor
    is adding their own components to the mix. That extensibility is probably the
    main reason why Kubernetes got such a broad adoption, why it grew so big, but
    also why it is so complex and, at times, not very intuitive. It is enormous, and
    it will continue growing. With that growth comes complexity that can be overwhelming.

  zh: Kubernetes 被设计成可扩展的。几乎每个软件和托管供应商都在其上添加了自己的组件。这种扩展性可能是 Kubernetes 获得如此广泛采用的主要原因，也是它能迅速发展的原因，但也正是因此它如此复杂，有时甚至不太直观。它庞大无比，且会继续发展。随着它的增长，复杂性也随之增加，可能让人感到不知所措。
- en: There is no reason to despair. The principles you learned are valid no matter
    how you set up your Kubernetes cluster or which parts of the ecosystem you choose
    to use. If you did not just skim through the book, you should know the essential
    core components. You did the hardest part. You learned some of the most commonly
    used resources. You know the logic behind them, and you know how to connect them.
    From now on, you just need to continue exploring and extending your Kubernetes
    knowledge. That is, if you make Kubernetes your platform of choice.

  zh: 不必绝望。你学到的原则无论你如何设置Kubernetes集群，或者选择使用生态系统的哪些部分，都是有效的。如果你没有只是草草浏览这本书，你应该已经掌握了核心的基础组件。你完成了最难的部分。你学会了一些最常用的资源，理解了它们背后的逻辑，知道了如何将它们连接起来。从现在开始，你只需要继续探索并扩展你的Kubernetes知识。当然前提是你选择了Kubernetes作为你的平台。
- en: For many, what you learned so far is (almost) everything they'll need. If that's
    not the case, the work on *The DevOps 2.4 Toolkit* already started and I hope
    you'll join me for the rest of the journey.

- en: I do not yet know the scope of the next book. What I do know is that there are
    too many Kubernetes-related subjects I had to leave out of this book to keep it
    within four hundred pages of self-imposed limit. The good news is that the next
    book is also going to be related to Kubernetes. Maybe it will be called "*Things
    you Failed to Find in the DevOps 2.3 Toolkit*" or maybe it will be "*The DevOps
    2.4 Toolkit –  Advanced Kubernetes*". It'll become clear soon. Maybe, by the time
    you're reading this text, it is already published.

    early. Around 10% was written when it went public. That allowed many of you to
    get early access to the material, and it gave me an opportunity to get your feedback.

    for improvements, recommended tools and processes that should be explored, and

- en: It would be tempting to take the whole credit for the book, but that would be
    untrue. This book is the result of teamwork between the author (me) and many of
    the readers (you). It proves that lean publishing works and that we can apply
    agile principles when writing a book. There was no fixed scope and decisions were
    not made in advance. I would work on a chapter and deliver it when it's finished
    (*sprint*). You would review it and send your notes and comments that would allow
    me to improve it (*sprint review*). We had a daily exchange of emails and Slack
    messages (*daily standups*). We did short iterations that allowed us to learn
    from the mistakes and improve.
