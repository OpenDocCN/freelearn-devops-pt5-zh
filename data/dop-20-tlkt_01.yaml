- en: Working on small greenfield projects is great. The last one I was involved with
    was during the summer of 2015 and, even though it had its share of problems, it
    was a real pleasure. Working with a small and relatively new set of products allowed
    us to choose technologies, practices, and frameworks we liked. Shall we use microservices?
    Yes, why not. Shall we try Polymer and GoLang? Sure! Not having baggage that holds
    you down is a wonderful feeling. A wrong decision would put us back for a week,
    but it would not put in danger years of work someone else did before us. Simply
    put, there was no legacy system to think about and be afraid of.

  zh: 从事小型绿地项目是一件很棒的事。我参与的最后一个项目是在2015年夏天，尽管它有一些问题，但整体上还是非常愉快的。与一套小而相对新的产品合作使我们能够选择我们喜欢的技术、实践和框架。我们是否应该使用微服务？当然，为什么不呢？我们是否应该尝试
    Polymer 和 GoLang？没问题！没有那些束缚你的包袱是一种美妙的感觉。一个错误的决定可能让我们退步一周，但它不会危及到别人之前辛勤工作的几年时间。简单来说，我们不需要考虑并害怕遗留系统的影响。
- en: Most of my career was not like that. I had the opportunity, or a curse, to work
    on big inherited systems. I worked for companies that existed long before I joined
    them and, for better or worse, already had their systems in place. I had to balance
    the need for innovation and improvement with obvious requirement that existing
    business must continue operating uninterrupted. During all those years I was continuously
    trying to discover new ways to improve those systems. It pains me to admit, but
    many of those attempts were failures.

- en: Discovering CI and, later on, CD, was one of the crucial points in my career.
    It all made perfect sense. The integration phase back in those days could last
    anything from days to weeks or even months. It was the period we all dreaded.
    After months of work performed by different teams working on different services
    or applications, the first day of the integration phase was the definition of
    hell on earth. If I didn't know better, I'd say that Dante was a developer and
    wrote Infierno during the integration phase.

  zh: 发现持续集成（CI）以及后来出现的持续交付（CD）是我职业生涯中的一个关键点。这一切都显得合情合理。在那个时候，集成阶段可能持续几天、几周，甚至几个月。这是我们都害怕的时期。在不同团队为不同服务或应用程序工作几个月后，集成阶段的第一天就是地狱的代名词。如果我不懂，我可能会说但丁是一个开发者，并且在集成阶段写了《地狱篇》。
- en: On the dreaded first day of the integration phase, we would all come to the
    office with grim faces. Only whispers could be heard while the integration engineer
    would announce that the whole system was set up, and the game could begin. He
    would turn it on and, sometimes, the result would be a blank screen. Months of
    work in isolation would prove, one more time, to be a disaster. Services and applications
    could not be integrated, and the long process of fixing problems would begin.
    In some cases, we would need to redo weeks of work. Requirements defined in advance
    were, as always, subject to different interpretations and those differences are
    nowhere more noticeable than in the integration phase.

  zh: 在令人畏惧的集成阶段的第一天，我们都会带着严肃的面孔走进办公室。只能听到低声耳语，集成工程师宣布整个系统已搭建好，游戏可以开始了。他启动系统，有时，结果是一个空白屏幕。几个月的独立工作再次证明是灾难性的。服务和应用程序无法集成，修复问题的漫长过程就此开始。在某些情况下，我们可能需要重新做几周的工作。提前定义的需求，像往常一样，会有不同的解释，这种差异在集成阶段尤为明显。
- en: Then **eXtreme Programming** (**XP**) practices came into existence and, with
    them, **continuous integration** (**CI**). The idea that integration should be
    done continuously today sounds like something obvious. Duh! Of course, you should
    not wait until the last moment to integrate! Back then, in the waterfall era,
    such a thing was not so obvious as today. We implemented a continuous integration
    pipeline and started checking out every commit, running static analysis, unit
    and functional tests, packaging, deploying and running integration tests. If any
    of those phases failed, we would abandon what we were doing and made fixing the
    problem detected by the pipeline our priority. The pipeline itself was fast. Minutes
    after someone would make a commit to the repository we would get a notification
    if something failed. Later on, **continuous delivery** (**CD**) started to take
    ground, and we would have confidence that every commit that passed the whole pipeline
    could be deployed to production. We could do even better and not only attest that
    each build is production ready, but apply *continuous deployment* and deploy every
    build without waiting for (manual) confirmation from anyone. And the best part
    of all that was that everything was fully automated.

  zh: 然后，**极限编程**（**XP**）实践诞生了，随之而来的是**持续集成**（**CI**）。今天，集成应该持续进行这个想法听起来似乎是显而易见的。嗯！当然，你不应该等到最后一刻才进行集成！但在当时的瀑布开发时代，这种做法并不如今天这样显而易见。我们实施了一个持续集成的流水线，并开始检查每一次提交，运行静态分析、单元测试、功能测试、打包、部署和集成测试。如果任何一个阶段失败，我们会放弃正在做的工作，并将修复流水线检测到的问题作为我们的首要任务。流水线本身非常快速。在有人提交代码到仓库后几分钟内，我们就会收到通知，若出现失败。后来，**持续交付**（**CD**）开始得到普及，我们可以确信每次通过整个流水线的提交都能部署到生产环境。我们甚至做得更好，不仅能验证每个构建是否准备好生产，而且可以应用*持续部署*，在不等待任何人（手动）确认的情况下，部署每个构建。所有这些最棒的一点是，一切都是全自动化的。
- en: It was a dream come true. Literally! It was a dream. It wasn't something we
    managed to turn into reality. Why was that? We made mistakes. We thought that
    CI/CD is a task for the operations department (today we'd call them *DevOps*).
    We thought that we could create a process that wraps around applications and services.
    We thought that CI tools and frameworks are ready. We thought that architecture,
    testing, business negotiations and other tasks were the job for someone else.

- en: Trying to fit a monolithic application developed by many people throughout the
    years, without tests, with tight coupling and outdated technology is like an attempt
    to make an eighty-year-old lady look young again. We can improve her looks, but
    the best we can do is make her look a bit less old, not young. Some systems are,
    simply put, too old to be worth the *modernization* effort. I tried it, many times,
    and the result was never as expected. Sometimes, the effort in making it *young
    again* is not cost effective. On the other hand, I could not go to the client
    of, let's say, a bank, and say we're going to rewrite your whole system. Risks
    are too big to rewrite everything and, be it as it might, due to its tight coupling,
    age, and outdated technology, changing parts of it is not worth the effort. The
    commonly taken option was to start building the new system and, in parallel, maintain
    the old one until everything was done. That was always a disaster. It can take
    years to finish such a project, and we all know what happens with things planned
    for such a long term. That's not even the waterfall approach. That's like standing
    at the bottom of Niagara Falls wondering why you get wet. Even doing trivial things
    like updating the JDK was quite a feat. And those were the cases when I would
    consider myself lucky. What would you do with, for example, codebase done in Fortran
    or Cobol?

  zh: 尝试调整一个由许多人多年来开发的单体应用，缺乏测试、耦合紧密且技术陈旧，就像试图让一个八十岁的老太太看起来年轻一样。我们可以改善她的外貌，但我们所能做的也就是让她看起来稍微不那么老，而不是年轻。简单来说，某些系统已经太老，不值得进行*现代化*努力。我尝试过，很多次，结果从未如预期。
    有时候，使其*恢复年轻*的努力是不划算的。另一方面，我无法去对银行之类的客户说：“我们将重写你们的整个系统。”重写一切的风险太大，而且由于其紧密耦合、老化和技术过时，改动其中的一部分也不值得投入太多精力。常见的做法是开始构建新系统，并在此期间维护旧系统，直到一切完成。这总是个灾难。完成这样一个项目可能需要好几年，而我们都知道长期规划的事情最终会怎么样。那甚至不是瀑布方法。那就像站在尼亚加拉大瀑布的底部，困惑自己为什么会被淋湿。即便是像更新
    JDK 这种琐事，也变得异常艰难。而那时候，我会觉得自己很幸运。那么，面对例如用 Fortran 或 Cobol 编写的代码库，你会怎么做呢？
- en: Then I heard about microservices. It was like music to my ears. The idea that
    we can build many small independent services that can be maintained by small teams,
    have codebase that can be understood in no time, being able to change framework,
    programming language or a database without affecting the rest of the system and
    being able to deploy it independently from the rest of the system was too good
    to be true. We could, finally, start taking parts of the monolithic application
    out without putting the whole system at (significant) risk. It sounded too good
    to be true. And it was. Benefits came with downsides. Deploying and maintaining
    a vast number of services turned out to be a heavy burden. We had to compromise
    and start standardizing services (killing innovation), we created shared libraries
    (coupling again), we were deploying them in groups (slowing everything), and so
    on. In other words, we had to remove the benefits microservices were supposed
    to bring. And let's not even speak of configurations and the mess they created
    inside servers. Those were the times I try to forget. We had enough problems like
    that with monoliths. Microservices only multiplied them. It was a failure. However,
    I was not yet ready to give up. Call me a masochist.

  zh: 然后我听说了微服务。这对我来说简直是如同天籁之音。我们可以构建许多小的独立服务，由小团队维护，代码库可以很快理解，能够在不影响整个系统的情况下更换框架、编程语言或数据库，并且可以独立部署的想法实在太美好了，几乎不敢相信。我们终于可以开始从单体应用中剥离一些部分，而不至于让整个系统（遭受重大）风险。听起来太完美了，结果也确实如此。好处的背后也有缺点。部署和维护大量服务最终变成了一项沉重的负担。我们不得不做出妥协，开始标准化服务（扼杀创新），创建共享库（再次耦合），将它们分组部署（拖慢一切进度），诸如此类。换句话说，我们不得不去除微服务本应带来的好处。更不用提配置和它们在服务器内部制造的混乱了。这些是我尽量忘记的日子。我们已经有了足够多与单体系统相关的问题，微服务只是将它们放大了。这是一次失败。然而，我还没有准备好放弃。叫我一个受虐狂也罢。

    and trolls. It would start to develop its own personality. Old and grumpy, fast

- en: You might, rightfully, wonder why we didn't use virtual machines in those days.
    Well, there are two answers to that question, and they depend on the definition
    of those days. One answer is that in those days we didn't have virtual machines,
    or they were so new that management was too scared to approve their usage. The
    other answer is that later on we did use VMs, and that was the real improvement.
    We could copy production environment and use it as, let's say testing environment.
    Except that there was still a lot of work to update configurations, networking,
    and so on.

  zh: 你可能会问，为什么在那些日子里我们没有使用虚拟机。嗯，这个问题有两个答案，它们取决于“那些日子”是指哪段时间。一个答案是，在那些日子里我们根本没有虚拟机，或者它们太新了，管理层对批准使用它们感到害怕。另一个答案是，后来我们确实使用了虚拟机，而那才是真正的改进。我们可以复制生产环境，并将其用作，比如说，测试环境。只不过，仍然需要做很多工作来更新配置、网络设置等等。
- en: Besides, we still did not know what was accumulated on those machines throughout
    the years. We just knew how to duplicate them. That still did not solve the problem
    that configurations were different from one VM to another as well as that a copy
    is the same as the original only for a short period. Do the deployment, change
    some configuration, bada bing, bada boom, you go back to the problem of testing
    something that is not the same as it will be in production. Differences accumulate
    with time unless you have a repeatable and reliable automated process instead
    of manual human interventions. If such a thing would exist, we could create immutable
    servers. Instead of deploying applications to existing servers and go down the
    path of accumulating differences, we could create a new VM as part of the CI/CD
    pipeline. So, instead of creating JARs, WAR, DLLs, and so on, we started creating
    VMs. Every time there was a new release it would come as a complete server built
    from scratch. That way we would know that what was tested is what goes into production.
    Create new VM with software deployed, test it and switch your production router
    to point from the old to the new one. It was awesome, except that it was slow
    and resource demanding. Having a separate VM for each service is overkill. Still,
    armed with patience, immutable servers were a good idea, but the way we used that
    approach and the tools required to support it were not good enough.

  zh: 此外，我们依然不知道这些机器上积累了多少东西。我们只知道如何复制它们。这仍然没有解决配置在不同虚拟机之间不同的问题，另外，复制虽然短时间内看似与原始环境一致，但最终会偏离。部署时，改一些配置，bada
    bing，bada boom，你又回到了测试与生产环境不一致的问题。差异随着时间的推移而积累，除非你有一个可重复且可靠的自动化流程，而不是依赖人工干预。如果这样的东西存在，我们就能创建不可变的服务器。与其把应用程序部署到现有的服务器上，走上积累差异的老路，我们可以把创建新的虚拟机作为
    CI/CD 流水线的一部分。于是，我们不再创建 JAR、WAR、DLL 等文件，而是开始创建虚拟机。每当有新的版本发布时，它会作为一个从头构建的完整服务器出现。通过这种方式，我们可以确保测试过的就是将要投入生产的版本。创建新的虚拟机，部署软件，进行测试，然后将生产路由器切换到新的虚拟机。这非常棒，除了它慢且资源消耗大。为每个服务创建单独的虚拟机有些过头。尽管如此，凭借耐心，不可变的服务器确实是一个好主意，但我们使用这种方法的方式以及支持它的工具并不够成熟。

    operations department) manually running those types of tasks was a recipe for
    disaster. Finally a story with a happy ending? Not really. You probably started
    noticing a pattern. As soon as one improvement was accomplished, it turned out
    that it, often, comes with a high price. Given enough time, Puppet and Chef scripts

    words so please fill in the blanks with your imagination). Maintaining them tends
