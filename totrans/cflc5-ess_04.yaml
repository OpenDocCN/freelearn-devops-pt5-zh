    we learned how to create spaces and pages. Over time, your space will grow and
    pages might not be in the right order or location. Users might also start complaining
    that they can't find the page you are referring to. This is the moment your space
    could use a little organization and cleanup.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pages within Confluence have a hierarchical structure where other pages can
    be grouped under a parent page. We refer to this group as **page family**. Pages
    within a page family are, by default, ordered in alphabetical order. When you
    create a new page it will be inserted into the page family in alphabetical order.
    It is possible to move pages to a different position, automatically changing the
    order mode to manual. In manual mode, the new page will be placed at the bottom
    of a page family.

  prefs:

- en: An **orphaned page** is a page without a parent page or any incoming links.
    An orphaned page does not appear in any navigation, so users have to know of its
    existence to be able to search for it. This means that if you have content on
    an orphaned page, it is very unlikely that people will find it using the natural
    course of navigation. An orphaned page can be found using search.
  prefs: []

    of the deleted parent page will be moved to the root of the space. From that moment
    the child page has become an orphaned page.
