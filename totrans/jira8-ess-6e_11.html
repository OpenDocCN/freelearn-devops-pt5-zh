			<h1 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor323"/>Jira Service Management</h1>
			<p>Jira was originally designed to be a tool to help developers track software bugs, and, over time, it evolved into a general-purpose, task-tracking tool that can be used by all organizations, thanks to its flexibility and extensibility. For this reason, many organizations started to use Jira as a service desk tool by leveraging its powerful workflow feature, and this has gained tremendous popularity. Recognizing this unique use case and its potential, a new product called Jira Service Management, from Atlassian, was born. Jira Service Management is a purpose-built solution that sits on top of the Jira platform, transforming it into a fully-fledged service desk solution with unique capabilities.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Introducing Jira Service Management</li>
				<li>Installing Jira Service Management</li>
				<li>Getting started with Jira Service Management</li>
				<li>Service desk user types</li>
				<li>Issue types and request types</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service-level agreements</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAs</strong>)</li>
				<li>Managing requests with queues</li>
				<li>Creating knowledge base articles</li>
				<li>Process automation</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-322"><a id="_idTextAnchor324"/>Introducing Jira Service Management</h1>
			<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker894"/> previous chapters, we explored Jira’s core features, including workflows, custom fields, and screens. It is not hard to see how you can implement Jira Software as a service desk by creating new custom fields, screens, and workflow schemes. While Jira is certainly capable of handling the requirements of a service desk, there are still several things to be desired.</p>
			<p>For example, the user interface is often too complicated and confusing for business users to simply create a support ticket. Despite our best efforts, there are still way too many options on the screen, most of which are not useful in a service desk environment. Another example is the lack of ability to set up any sort of SLA to ensure a consistent quality of service.</p>
			<p>This is where <a id="_idIndexMarker895"/>Jira Service Management comes in. It addresses all the out-of-the-box shortcomings of Jira by providing a clean, intuitive, and user-friendly interface for both the end customers and the support team. It also provides many features that you can expect from a service desk solution. As shown in the following screenshot, Jira Service Management lets you serve your customers in four easy steps:</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.1 – Jira Service Management</p>
			<p>As shown here, Jira Service Management <a id="_idIndexMarker896"/>simplifies the process of raising a service request to fulfill that request by providing a unique experience for users of different personas.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-323"><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>Installing Jira Service Management</h1>
			<p>There are two <a id="_idIndexMarker897"/>ways you can get Jira Service Management. The first option is to install it in an existing Jira Core or Jira Software instance that you possess. This is the easiest approach as it does not require you to provision additional hardware and lets you leverage what you already have. It also makes it easy for your agents to collaborate with other teams to help resolve customer requests. These are the steps you should follow to install Jira Service Management:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Log in as a Jira administrator user.</li>
				<li>Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Applications</strong> tab.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Try it for free</strong> button under <strong class="bold">Jira Service Management</strong> from the right-hand panel:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.2_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.2 – Trying and installing Jira Service Management&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.2 – Trying and installing Jira Service Management</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Accept the user agreement and follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The second<a id="_idIndexMarker898"/> option is to install Jira Service Management as a standalone application. Use this option if you do not have a Jira Software instance already running, or if you would like to keep your software issue tracking system and support system separate. Users from both instances can still collaborate to resolve customer requests as in option one, with a few extra steps to set up. These are as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create an application link between the two Jira instances.</li>
				<li>Integrate both Jira instances with the same user repository, such as LDAP, to ensure that you have the same set of user details in both systems.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>To install Jira Service Management as a standalone application, you can refer to <a href="B18644_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Jira Data Center</em>, as the installation steps are mostly identical.</p>
			<p>When it comes to <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>deciding which option to pick, there are several factors you should consider:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost</strong>: If you want to deploy a standalone instance of Jira Service Management, there will be the initial cost of hardware and software, as well as maintenance after the system goes live.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Complexity</strong>: This can go either way. On the one hand, a standalone deployment adds complexity as you have more servers to look after, but on the other hand, having a combined deployment, you are adding complexity to the configurations of your system. So, you will need to balance this by looking at what in-house expertise is available. Do you have a team that is handling all the infrastructure and can take on more servers? Do you have an experienced Jira administrator that can look after a combined Jira instance?</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Security</strong>: When Jira Service Management is deployed standalone, it is separate from your other Jira instances. This makes accidental data leaks due to misconfigurations and other mistakes less likely. This is especially important if your service management projects are publicly accessible and your software projects are internal only; you will need to be extra careful to ensure data security if both public and private projects are in the same instance.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: This is another factor that can easily be overlooked. If you deploy Jira Service Management into the same instance as Jira Software, you need to make sure the added load from your service management projects can be handled by your current hardware, especially if you allow public access to your projects.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Maintenance</strong>: As you start using Jira Service Management, you will likely make customizations and add third-party apps, which can add complexity at upgrade times. If Jira Service Management is a standalone deployment, then any customizations will be localized to that deployment only. But if you have a combined deployment, you will need to ensure all customizations and apps are compatible with the <a id="_idIndexMarker900"/>version you want to upgrade to.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As we can see, there are many factors to consider here when deciding on your deployment model. The good news is that you can always merge or split your deployment later so that you are not stuck with your decision forever. However, this can be a very involved process, especially for large deployments, so it is recommended to plan out your vision for how you will use Jira in the long term.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>Getting started with Jira Service Management</h1>
			<p>Before we start using Jira Service Management, it is important to understand and familiarize ourselves with the key terminology, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agents</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>are members of your service support team <a id="_idIndexMarker902"/>that will be working on customer requests. They are users that can perform actions such as editing, assigning, and closing requests.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customers</strong>: These are<a id="_idIndexMarker903"/> the end users that will be raising support<a id="_idIndexMarker904"/> requests at your service desk. These can be customers of your product or colleagues from other departments needing IT support.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer portal</strong>: This is<a id="_idIndexMarker905"/> the main landing page for your <a id="_idIndexMarker906"/>customers. It is a simple, clean, and easy-to-use front interface for your service desk, without all the extra noise from the standard Jira interface, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.3_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.3 – Customer portal&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.3 – Customer portal</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Queues</strong>: These are<a id="_idIndexMarker907"/> like Jira filters that show you a subset of <a id="_idIndexMarker908"/>issues that meet a certain criterion. Service desk agents use queues to prioritize and pick out requests to work on.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Requests</strong>: These are <a id="_idIndexMarker909"/>what your end users (not agents), such as <a id="_idIndexMarker910"/>customers, submit to Jira Service Management. Under the hood, they are just normal Jira issues. However, using the term <strong class="bold">request</strong> is less confusing in the context of a service desk environment. In short, requests are what your customers see, and issues are what agents see.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service desks</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker911"/> are where customers will <a id="_idIndexMarker912"/>raise their requests. Under the hood, a service desk is a Jira project of the Service Desk project type. Please refer to <a href="B18644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Jira for Business Projects</em>, for more information on project types.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As shown in the following screenshot, when customers interact with requests, the user interface is very different from what agents will see. It is a much simpler UI that only displays key information about the request, such as its description and status. Customers cannot make changes to the request details after the request is submitted, and can only add new comments or attachments to the request:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.4_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.4 – Request view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.4 – Request view</p>
			<p>The key information regarding service desks is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Request type</strong>: This represents <a id="_idIndexMarker913"/>the different types of requests customers can make. These can be anything, including a problem report, help request, or general inquiry. When you create a new request type, Jira creates a new issue type behind the scenes. One major feature of the request type is that it allows you to specify a user-friendly name for it. While the actual issue type is called a <strong class="bold">Problem Report</strong>, you can rename it and display it as <strong class="bold">Submit a problem report</strong> instead.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Service desk</strong>: This is what<a id="_idIndexMarker914"/> agents will be working from. Each service desk has a front, customer-facing portal. Behind the scenes, a service desk is a Jira project controlled by Jira permissions, workflows, and other schemes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">SLA</strong>: An SLA defines <a id="_idIndexMarker915"/>the quality of service that is being guaranteed to your customers. In Jira Service Management, SLAs are measured in time, such as response time and the overall time taken to resolve issues.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>Creating a new service desk</h2>
			<p>The first step to<a id="_idIndexMarker916"/> start working with Jira Service Management is to create a new service<a id="_idIndexMarker917"/> desk project. Since, under the hood, a service desk is a Jira project with a new user interface, the easiest option is to create a new project using one of the Service project templates.</p>
			<p>To create a new service desk, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="bold">Create project</strong> option from the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> drop-down menu.</li>
				<li>Choose a project template, such as <strong class="bold">IT Service Desk</strong>, from the <strong class="bold">Service project type</strong> box, and click on <strong class="bold">Next</strong>.</li>
				<li>Enter the name and key for the new service desk project and click <strong class="bold">Submit</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.5_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.5 – Creating a service desk project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.5 – Creating a service desk project</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you<a id="_idIndexMarker918"/> can use an existing Jira project and convert it into a service <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>desk. All you have to do is update the project’s type by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project settings page for the project you want to turn into a service desk.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> option from the left panel.</li>
				<li>Change the <strong class="bold">Project type</strong> option to <strong class="bold">Service</strong> and click on <strong class="bold">Save details</strong>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.6_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.6 – Changing the project type&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.6 – Changing the project type</p>
			<p>Features that <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>are exclusive to a project type will be lost when you switch a<a id="_idIndexMarker921"/> project’s type. Once your service desk has been created, you will be taken to your service desk user interface, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.7_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.7 – Jira Service Management UI&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.7 – Jira Service Management UI</p>
			<p>Every service<a id="_idIndexMarker922"/> desk has two interfaces. One will be used by you, as the admin, and members of your support team, known as agents. The second interface is called the customer portal, which is what customers will see and use to create requests and interact with agents. As you make configuration changes for your service desk, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker923"/>always preview the change by clicking on <strong class="bold">Customer channels</strong> and then the <strong class="bold">Visit the portal</strong> link from the left navigation panel, which will show you what the customer portal will look like.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The URL shown under the customer portal is what your customers should use to access your service desk.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>Branding your customer portal</h2>
			<p>You can brand your<a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> customer portal for your service desk with the following <a id="_idIndexMarker925"/>options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Help center name</strong>: This is the overall name for your help center. Think of this as the name for your Jira instance.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer portal name</strong>: This is the name of a specific service desk portal.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer portal introduction text</strong>: This is the welcome text that will be displayed for a specific service desk portal.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer portal logo</strong>: This is the logo for a specific service desk portal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following screenshot illustrates each of these items on a sample customer portal:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.8_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.8 – Customized portal&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.8 – Customized portal</p>
			<p>To configure a specific <a id="_idIndexMarker926"/>customer portal’s branding, perform the<a id="_idIndexMarker927"/> following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project settings page of the service desk you want to brand.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Portal settings</strong> from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Enter a name and welcome text in the <strong class="bold">Name</strong> and <strong class="bold">Introduction</strong> text fields, respectively.</li>
				<li>Check the <strong class="bold">Use a custom logo for this Customer Portal</strong> option and upload a logo for your customer portal.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker928"/>configuration settings look as<a id="_idIndexMarker929"/> follows:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.9 – Portal configuration</p>
			<p>Now that we have seen how to create a service desk and brand its customer portal, let’s take a look at the different user types Jira Service Management has.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>Service desk user types</h1>
			<p>Jira Service Management introduces several new user types. Under the hood, these user types are mapped to new project roles created by Jira Service Management when it is installed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agent</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker930"/> are members of the service desk team that work <a id="_idIndexMarker931"/>on requests. Agents <a id="_idIndexMarker932"/>are added to the <strong class="bold">Service Desk Team</strong> project role.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Collaborator</strong>: These<a id="_idIndexMarker933"/> are the members from other business<a id="_idIndexMarker934"/> functions; they are not members of your service desk team. However, they can help solve customer problems. A good example would be product domain experts or engineers. Collaborators are added to the <strong class="bold">Service Desk Team</strong> project role.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer</strong>: These are<a id="_idIndexMarker935"/> end users that will be submitting <a id="_idIndexMarker936"/>requests through your help desk portal. Customers are added to the <strong class="bold">Service Desk Customers</strong> project role.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organization</strong>: These <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>are groups of customers. For example, an organization<a id="_idIndexMarker938"/> can represent a company, and all employees of that company will be part of the organization. Requests can be limited to being only sharable among customers of the same organization.</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor330"/>Adding an agent to a service desk</h2>
			<p>Agents are Jira users who will<a id="_idIndexMarker939"/> be working on customer requests in Jira Service<a id="_idIndexMarker940"/> Management. These are usually members of your support team. Agents consume the Jira Service Management licenses. To add an agent to a service desk, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the service desk you want to add an agent to.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Invite team</strong> option in the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Search and add users you want to invite as an agent (member) of your service desk team. You can select and add more than one agent. Click on the <strong class="bold">Invite x people</strong> button:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.10_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.10 – Adding an agent&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.10 – Adding an agent</p>
			<p>When you’re<a id="_idIndexMarker941"/> adding an agent to a service desk, you can select an <a id="_idIndexMarker942"/>existing user in Jira, which will grant the user access to the service desk. If the user you want to add as an agent does not exist, you can also create a new Jira account and add them as an agent in a single step by typing in the user’s email address. An email will be sent out with a link to set their password. New user accounts created in this<a id="_idIndexMarker943"/> way will be automatically added to the <strong class="bold">jira-servicedesk-users</strong> group<a id="_idIndexMarker944"/> and <strong class="bold">Service Desk Team</strong> project role. Refer to <a href="B18644_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Securing Jira</em>, for more information on groups and roles.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-329"><a id="_idTextAnchor331"/>Managing service desk customers</h2>
			<p>Customers are end users who <a id="_idIndexMarker945"/>will be creating requests through your customer portal. You can manually invite customers or allow them to sign up themselves. Jira Service Management requires customers to have an account to submit requests. The good news is that customers do not consume the Jira Service Management licenses, so you can have as many customers as you want.</p>
			<p>When a customer raises a request with your service desk, the request may contain sensitive information that is specific to the customer. Your service desk may also serve customers from different organizations. Therefore, you need to manage how requests and their associated data are shared and accessed.</p>
			<p>The first step is to decide who can be customers of your service desk, and also how requests from one customer can be shared with another:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project administrator page for the service desk where you want to manage customer permissions.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Customer permissions</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Choose who can raise requests in your service desk as customers under the <strong class="bold">Who can raise requests?</strong> section. By default, anyone with an account can raise requests, but you can narrow it down to specific users that are added to your service desk.</li>
				<li>Choose how requests can be shared under the <strong class="bold">Who can customers share requests with?</strong> section. Usually, you only want customers to be able to share request information within their own organizations.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to save your changes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you have narrowed your customer’s permissions to only allow specific customers to raise requests at your service desk, you will need to add/invite them. To invite a customer to a service desk, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the service desk where you want to add a customer.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Customers</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add customers</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Enter the email addresses of customers to invite and click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button, as shown:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.11_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.11 – Adding customers&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.11 – Adding customers</p>
			<p>Emails will be<a id="_idIndexMarker946"/> sent out to customers with details on how to access the customer portal and steps to create an account if necessary.</p>
			<p>If your service desk serves customers from multiple organizations, you can create these organizations and add customers to them. By having customers grouped in their own organizations, you can control how requests can be shared among different customers.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-330"><a id="_idTextAnchor332"/>Adding a collaborator to a service desk</h2>
			<p>Collaborators <a id="_idIndexMarker947"/>are Jira users who are not part of your support<a id="_idIndexMarker948"/> team (not agents) but have expert knowledge and understanding in the domain area that can assist agents in diagnosing and solving customer requests. In Jira Service Management, collaborators are users in <a id="_idIndexMarker949"/>the <strong class="bold">Service Desk Team</strong> project role, but not in the <strong class="bold">jira-servicedesk-users</strong> group, and adding a user as a collaborator is an easy way to grant that user access to your service desk project. Collaborators do not consume Jira Service Management licenses.</p>
			<p>To add a collaborator to your service desk, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project administrator page for the service desk you want to add a collaborator to.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Users and roles</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add users to a role</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Search for and select the users <a id="_idIndexMarker950"/>to add, choose the <strong class="bold">Service Desk Team</strong> role, and <a id="_idIndexMarker951"/>click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When making a user a collaborator, you are simply giving the user permission to access your service desk so that they can view, comment, and add attachments to the request.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-331"><a id="_idTextAnchor333"/>Issue types and request types</h1>
			<p>Jira uses issue types<a id="_idIndexMarker952"/> to define the purpose of issues, while Jira Service Management uses <a id="_idIndexMarker953"/>request types for the same purpose. Behind the scenes, each request type is mapped to an issue type. The one key difference between the two is that a request type is what is shown to the customers, and often has a more descriptive name. For example, an issue type is called an <strong class="bold">Incident</strong>, and the<a id="_idIndexMarker954"/> corresponding request type will be called a <strong class="bold">Report System Outage</strong>. You can<a id="_idIndexMarker955"/> think of request types as issue types with a more informative display name. As we will see later in this section, another key feature of request types is that you can organize them into groups to help your users find what they need.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-332"><a id="_idTextAnchor334"/>Setting up request types</h2>
			<p>To create a new <a id="_idIndexMarker956"/>request type for your service desk, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project settings page for the service desk where you want to create a new request type.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Request Types</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Select the group this request type should belong to from the left. We will talk about groups later in this section.</li>
				<li>Enter a name for the request type. You can be as descriptive as possible here so that your customers can easily understand its purpose.</li>
				<li>Click on the image under <strong class="bold">Icon</strong> to select a new icon for the request type.</li>
				<li>Select the issue type that the request type is mapped to.</li>
				<li>Enter an optional description. This description will be displayed underneath the request name to help your customer decide what type of request to create.</li>
				<li>Click on <a id="_idIndexMarker957"/>the <strong class="bold">Create request type</strong> button to create the new request type:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.12_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.12 – Create request type&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.12 – Create request type</p>
			<p>You can reorder the request types by dragging them up and down the list. The order you set in the list will be reflected on the customer portal. Make sure you put some thought into this so that the list flows logically. For example, you can order them alphabetically or by placing the most common request types at the top.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-333"><a id="_idTextAnchor335"/>Organizing request types into groups</h2>
			<p>As the number of <a id="_idIndexMarker958"/>request types grows, you can group similar <a id="_idIndexMarker959"/>request types into groups. Therefore, when customers visit the portal, all the request types will be organized logically, making navigation much easier. For example, as shown in the following screenshot of a customer portal, we have six request type groups, where five come with Jira Service Management’s project templates; the sixth, <strong class="bold">Sample Request Group</strong>, is custom. When clicking on <strong class="bold">Sample Request Group</strong>, we also have the three custom request types:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.13_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.13 – Custom request type and group&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.13 – Custom request type and group</p>
			<p>As we saw earlier in this section, a request type can be added to one or more groups. You can select one of the existing groups, or create a new group, by simply typing in the new group’s name. When a request type belongs to two or more groups, it will be displayed when each of the groups is selected in the portal.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-334"><a id="_idTextAnchor336"/>Setting up fields for request type</h1>
			<p>Jira Service <a id="_idIndexMarker960"/>Management lets you set up different field <a id="_idIndexMarker961"/>layouts for each request type. The important thing to note here is that, when you are setting up fields for Jira Service Management, you are not creating new custom fields (as you would in Jira Software). You are simply adding and removing existing fields in the request form when customers create a new request. You can think of this as adding fields to screens. If you want to add a field that does not exist yet, you will have to create a new custom field first, as described in <a href="B18644_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor119"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Field Management</em>, and then make it available in the request form.</p>
			<p>Just as with request types, Jira Service Management allows you to provide a custom display name to the field, independent of the actual field’s name. This means that the field can be more informative when displayed to customers. For example, for the Jira <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> field, you can give it a display name of <strong class="bold">What is the problem you are having?</strong>. As the display name is independent of the field’s name, your existing filters and search queries will continue to work as-is.</p>
			<p>To set up field layouts for a request type, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project settings page for the service desk you want to set up field layouts for.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Request Types</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit fields</strong> link for the request type you want to set up fields for. This will list all the fields that are currently displayed when customers create a new request:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.14_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.14 – Adding a field to the request form&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.14 – Adding a field to the request form</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Click on the <strong class="bold">Add a field</strong> button and select an existing field (both system and custom) to add to the request type.</li>
				<li>Click on the field’s <strong class="bold">Display name</strong> to change what customers will see when the field is displayed. This does not change the field’s actual name in Jira – it only makes the display more user-friendly.</li>
				<li>Change the<a id="_idIndexMarker962"/> field’s mandatory requirement by<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> clicking on the <strong class="bold">Required</strong> column. Note that you cannot change this value if it is grayed out. An example of this is the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> field.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After you have set up your field layout for the request type, you can click on the <strong class="bold">View this request form</strong> link at the top to see a preview of the result. As shown in the following screenshot, we added the <strong class="bold">Due Date</strong> field to the form, but it is now displayed as <strong class="bold">When do you need this by?</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.15_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.15 – The field displayed in the request form&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.15 – The field displayed in the request form</p>
			<p>One thing to keep in <a id="_idIndexMarker964"/>mind is that this field layout is specific to each<a id="_idIndexMarker965"/> request type, so if you have multiple request types that share the same field layout, you will need to configure each individually.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-335"><a id="_idTextAnchor337"/>Setting up a workflow for a request type</h1>
			<p>Just as with <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>fields, you can also control how workflow statuses <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>are displayed in Jira Service Management. Note that you cannot change the actual workflow, but you can make the workflow less confusing to your customers so that they know exactly how their requests are progressing.</p>
			<p>To set up the <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>workflow for a request type, perform the <a id="_idIndexMarker969"/>following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project settings page for the service desk you want to set up a workflow for.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Request types</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit fields</strong> link for the request type you want to set up a workflow for.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Workflow Statuses</strong> tab. This will list all the workflow statuses that are available in the workflow, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.16_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.16 – Customizing the workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.16 – Customizing the workflow</p>
			<p>As shown in<a id="_idIndexMarker970"/> the preceding screenshot, the actual Jira <a id="_idIndexMarker971"/>workflow status names are listed in the left-hand column. For each of the statuses, you can choose to give it a different display name that will be shown to customers.</p>
			<p>For example, <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong> is a normal Jira workflow status, and represents that the request is currently with a support agent. We can change it to <strong class="bold">Under investigation</strong>, and this is what will be displayed when a customer is viewing the issue.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You are not changing the workflow itself. You are simply making it more user-friendly for your customers.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-336"><a id="_idTextAnchor338"/>Service-level agreement (SLA)</h1>
			<p>An SLA defines <a id="_idIndexMarker972"/>the agreement between the service provider (your organization) and the end user (your customer) in terms of the aspects of the service provided, such as its scope, quality, or turnaround time.</p>
			<p>In the context of a support service, an SLA will define different response times for different types of support requests. For example, severity 1 requests will have a response time of 1 hour, while severity 2 requests will have a response time of 4 hours.</p>
			<p>Jira Service Management lets you define SLA requirements based on response time. You can set up the rules on how response time will be measured, and the goals for each rule.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-337"><a id="_idTextAnchor339"/>Setting up an SLA</h2>
			<p>Jira Service <a id="_idIndexMarker973"/>Management‘s SLA is divided into two components: the time measurement and goals to achieve. Time can be measured for a variety of purposes. Common examples include overall time taken for request resolution and response time to customer requests. To set up an SLA metric, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project settings page for the service desk you want to set up the SLA on.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">SLAs</strong> option from the left-hand panel and then click on the <strong class="bold">Create SLA</strong> option.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For any SLA, you will need to define when the clock will start counting and when it will stop counting, with an option to pause during the process. Jira provides many options for choosing when to start and stop the clock. Most common options include when a request enters or leaves a workflow status; other options include when a value is set on a field, such as assignee or resolution.</p>
			<p>A simple example would be for Jira Service Management to start counting as soon as the request is created. Every time an agent requests further information from the customer, the count will be paused until the customer responds. Once the request is finally closed off, the count will be stopped. The following steps show how to set up an SLA time measurement for a simple <a id="_idIndexMarker974"/>example:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">For the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> column, we will select the <strong class="bold">Issue Created</strong> option, indicating that it can start counting as soon as the request is created.</li>
				<li>For the <strong class="bold">Pause on</strong> column, we will select the <strong class="bold">Status: Waiting for customer</strong> option, indicating that the counting can be paused when the request enters the <strong class="bold">Waiting for customer</strong> workflow status.</li>
				<li>For the <strong class="bold">Stop</strong> column, we will select the <strong class="bold">Entered Status: Canceled</strong>, <strong class="bold">Entered Status: Closed</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Resolution: Set</strong> options, indicating that the counting will be stopped once the request is canceled, closed, or a resolution is set.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As shown in the following<a id="_idIndexMarker975"/> screenshot, for each of the three columns, you can select more than one condition:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.17_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.17 – SLA example 1&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.17 – SLA example 1</p>
			<p>This allows you to set up <a id="_idIndexMarker976"/>multiple entry points to start and stop time. An example of this usage would be to measure response time. For example, perhaps you need to guarantee that an agent will respond to a new request within an hour. If the request is sent back to the customer for further information, a response time of 1 hour is also required as soon as the customer updates the request with the requested information. The following points show how to set up the time measurement for this SLA:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>For the <strong class="bold">Start</strong> column, we will select both the <strong class="bold">Issue Create</strong> and <strong class="bold">Entered Status: In Progress</strong> options. Therefore, we will start counting when the issue is first created, and also when it is put back for our agents to work on.</li>
				<li>For the <strong class="bold">Stop</strong> column, we will select both the <strong class="bold">Entered Status: Waiting for Info</strong> and <strong class="bold">Entered Status: Closed</strong> options. Counting will stop when an agent sends the request back to the customer for more information or when it is closed for completion.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The difference between the two examples here is that, in the second example, we do not pause time counting when the request enters the <strong class="bold">Waiting for customer</strong> status. Instead, we stop counting completely. This means that when the request enters the <strong class="bold">Waiting for customer</strong> status, the current counting cycle ends, and when the request enters the <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong> status, a <a id="_idIndexMarker977"/>new counting cycle will begin, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.18_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.18 – SLA example 2&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.18 – SLA example 2</p>
			<p>Once we have defined<a id="_idIndexMarker978"/> how time should be measured, the next step is to set up the SLA goals. The SLA goals define the amount of time allowed for each of the scenarios we have just set up. If we take the aforementioned response time example, we may set up our goals like so:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.19_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.19 – SLA goals&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.19 – SLA goals</p>
			<p>In our example, we <a id="_idIndexMarker979"/>have defined that for requests whose priority has been set to <strong class="bold">Highest</strong>, the response time will be 1 hour (<strong class="bold">1h</strong>); <strong class="bold">High</strong> and <strong class="bold">Medium</strong> requests will have a response time of 4 and 8 hours, respectively. Everything else will be responded to within 12 hours.</p>
			<p>As you can see, there are several components when it comes to defining an SLA goal, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issues</strong>: These are the issues/requests that will have the goal applied to them. Use JQL to narrow down the selection of issues.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Goal</strong>: This is the time value for the goal. You can use the standard Jira time notation here, where 3h means 3 hours, 45m means 45 minutes, and 2h30m means 2 hours and 30 minutes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Calendar</strong>: These define the working days and hours the SLA will be applied to. For example, <strong class="bold">24/7 Calendar</strong> means that time will be counted every hour of every day. As we will see later, you can create your own custom calendars to define your working days, hours, and even holidays.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When defining SLA criteria, we will need to use JQL. Just like doing an advanced search, Jira Service Management provides syntax autocomplete to help us validate our queries, as shown in the following<a id="_idIndexMarker980"/> screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.20_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.20 – SLA goal criteria&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.20 – SLA goal criteria</p>
			<p>Next, we will look at how to create and configure calendars for an SLA.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-338"><a id="_idTextAnchor340"/>Setting up custom calendars</h2>
			<p>As we have seen, when setting up an<a id="_idIndexMarker981"/> SLA, you can select a calendar that defines the working days and hours, which can be counted toward the goal. Jira Service Management comes with <strong class="bold">Default 24/7 calendar</strong> and <strong class="bold">Sample 9-5 calendar</strong>, which will only count the time between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M. from Monday to Friday.</p>
			<p>You can create custom calendars so that they include different working hours, time zones, and holidays. To create a custom calendar for your service desk, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project settings page for the service desk you want to add a calendar for.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">SLAs</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> option, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Add calendar</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Enter a name and description for the new calendar and configure the options.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Jira Service Management lets you configure your calendar with the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time zone</strong>: This sets the time zone that will be used for the calendar</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Working days</strong>: This sets the days that can be counted toward the SLA</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Working hours</strong>: These are the hours of each working day that can be included in the SLA</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Holidays</strong>: This adds <a id="_idIndexMarker982"/>holidays, such as Christmas, so that they’re excluded from the SLA</li>
			</ul>
			<p>As shown in the following screenshot, we have set up our calendar so that we have a working time between 9 A.M. and 5 P.M., Tuesday to Friday. This means that Monday, Saturday, and Sunday are excluded when calculating SLA metrics:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.21_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.21 – SLA calendar working days&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.21 – SLA calendar working days</p>
			<p>We have also added <a id="_idIndexMarker983"/>Christmas Day and New Year’s Day as holidays so that the SLA will not be applied on those days:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.22_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.22 – SLA calendar holidays&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.22 – SLA calendar holidays</p>
			<p>When adding <a id="_idIndexMarker984"/>holidays, you can check the <strong class="bold">Repeat yearly</strong> option if the holiday will always fall on the same day every year, such as Christmas Day, so that you do not need to manually add them each year.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-339"><a id="_idTextAnchor341"/>Managing requests with queues</h1>
			<p>Queues are lists of<a id="_idIndexMarker985"/> requests with predefined criteria for agents to work <a id="_idIndexMarker986"/>through. You can think of them as Jira filters. They help you and your teams organize incoming requests into more manageable groups so that you can prioritize them. Jira Service Management uses Jira’s search mechanism to configure queues. Refer to <a href="B18644_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor292"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Searching, Reporting, and Analysis</em>, for more details on Jira search options.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-340"><a id="_idTextAnchor342"/>Creating a new queue</h2>
			<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker987"/> you first create a service desk, several default queues are created automatically for you. This includes an <strong class="bold">Assigned to me</strong> queue<a id="_idIndexMarker988"/> that lists all unresolved requests that are assigned to the currently logged-in user and a queue for each request type. You, as the service desk administrator, can create new queues for your team. To create a new queue, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the service desk you want to add a queue for. Note that queues are not managed in the project settings console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Queues</strong> option from the left-hand panel and click on the <strong class="bold">New queue</strong> option from the <strong class="bold">Switch Queues</strong> drop-down menu.</li>
				<li>Enter a name for the queue. It should reflect its purpose and the types of requests that will be in it.</li>
				<li>Use the UI controls to create the search criteria. If you are familiar with JQL or need to use exclusion logic in your query, you can click on the <strong class="bold">Advanced</strong> link and use JQL directly.</li>
				<li>Select the fields that will be displayed when the queue is showing the issue list. Click on the <strong class="bold">More</strong> option to find more fields to add. You can also drag the fields left and right to rearrange them. You can select the fields that will display the most useful information.</li>
				<li>Click on<a id="_idIndexMarker989"/> the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button to create the queue, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.23_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.23 – Creating a new queue&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.23 – Creating a new queue</p>
			<p>As shown in the preceding screenshot, when you make changes to your search criteria and field selection, there is a preview area at the bottom that will show you the result of your search and the field layout.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-341"><a id="_idTextAnchor343"/>Creating knowledge base articles</h1>
			<p>As your team works <a id="_idIndexMarker990"/>diligently to solve problems for your customers, nuggets of knowledge will start to accumulate over time. These include things such as common questions customers face, and the steps taken to troubleshoot them. Jira Service Management allows you to extract this information and create a knowledge base, which helps customers find solutions themselves. Out of the box, Jira Service Management only supports Atlassian Confluence for knowledge base creation, but it is possible to use other tools via third-party add-ons.</p>
			<p>To integrate Jira Service Management with Confluence, you will have to create an application link between Jira and Confluence. If you have already done this, feel free to skip to the next section. To create an application link for Confluence, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Applications</strong> tab and the <strong class="bold">Application links</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create link</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Atlassian product</strong> option, enter the fully qualified URL to your Confluence instance, and click on the <strong class="bold">Continue</strong> button, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.24_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.24 – Creating an application link with Confluence&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.24 – Creating an application link with Confluence</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Follow the onscreen wizard to complete the linking process.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once the application link has been created with Confluence, we can use it for Jira Service Management. Each service desk will need to be individually integrated with a Confluence space. To set up a Confluence knowledge base for a service desk, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <a id="_idIndexMarker991"/>project settings page of the service desk you want to set up a Confluence knowledge base for.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Knowledge base</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Check the <strong class="bold">Link to a Confluence space</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Select the linked Confluence space (it may be named something other than Confluence) from the <strong class="bold">Application</strong> dropdown.</li>
				<li>Select the Confluence space where the knowledge base article will be created. If you do not have a space already, click on the <strong class="bold">Create a knowledge base space</strong> link.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Link</strong> button <a id="_idIndexMarker992"/>to complete the integration setup, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.25_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.25 – Adding a knowledge base&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You can link one service desk to one Confluence space.</p>
			<p>After the integration<a id="_idIndexMarker993"/> is in place, when an agent views a request, the <strong class="bold">create an article</strong> option will become available. Clicking on that will allow the agent to create a new knowledge base article in the preconfigured Confluence space, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.26_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.26 – Creating a knowledge base article&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.26 – Creating a knowledge base article</p>
			<p>From the customer’s perspective, a new search box will be available on the customer portal (for a service desk, with the knowledge base feature enabled). Customers will be able to search to see whether any information is already available concerning their problems. As shown in the following screenshot, when searching for <strong class="bold">File</strong>, the service desk returns a knowledge article from past requests. If this is what the customer is looking for, it will save <a id="_idIndexMarker994"/>valuable time for both the customer and the agent:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.27 – Searching for a knowledge base article</p>
			<p>You can further<a id="_idIndexMarker995"/> fine-tune this by selectively enabling the request types that should have a knowledge base enabled – for example, you may only want to enable Support or Inquiry request types but not Incidents. In the next section, we will look at how you can automate certain tasks for your service desk.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-342"><a id="_idTextAnchor344"/>Process automation</h1>
			<p>When running a<a id="_idIndexMarker996"/> service desk, many mundane and repetitive tasks can end up wasting a lot of your team’s time. For example, after a request has been closed, if the customer subsequently adds a comment, the request needs to be reopened, so it will be placed back into the queue for agents to work on again. Normally, this would require either an agent to manually reopen the request, or you, as the Jira administrator, to configure the workflow used by your service desk project to automatically reopen the request. This can be tedious for the agents, and overwhelming for you, if there are many service desk projects that require this kind of automation.</p>
			<p>The good news is that Jira Service Management has a process automation feature that greatly reduces some of this repetitive tasks and allows each service desk owner (users with the Administer Projects permission) to set up the automation rules, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.28_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.28 – Process automation rules&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.28 – Process automation rules</p>
			<p>Follow these steps to set up automation rules:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project settings page of the service desk you want to set up automation rules for.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Automation</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add rule</strong> button to create a new automation rule.</li>
				<li>Select one of the pre-made automation rule templates from the dialog box, or select the <strong class="bold">Custom rule</strong> option from the list to create one from scratch.</li>
				<li>Enter a name for the new automation rule.</li>
				<li>Configure the automation rule and click on <strong class="bold">Save</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are several <a id="_idIndexMarker997"/>things to consider when configuring your automation rule. Firstly, each rule is made up of three parts called <strong class="bold">WHEN</strong> (trigger), <strong class="bold">IF</strong> (condition), and <strong class="bold">THEN</strong> (action), as shown in the following screenshot. The way to think about this is that your rule should read something like this – <strong class="bold">when</strong> something happens on a request, <strong class="bold">if</strong> the criterion is met, <strong class="bold">then</strong> execute the following actions. So, if we take the example of a customer adding comments to a closed request, the rule may be something like this – when a comment is added, if the request is in the Closed status, then transition the request to Re-opened:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_11.29_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 11.29 – Creating a new process automation rule&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 11.29 – Creating a new process automation rule</p>
			<p>You can configure <a id="_idIndexMarker998"/>these components of the automation rule by clicking on the UI elements representing each component. There are a few points to keep in mind when designing your rule:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can only have one WHEN, which acts as the entry point for the rule. However, it can have multiple triggers, so each rule can be triggered by more than one action.</li>
				<li>You can have more than one IF (that is, an ELSE IF), so you can set up multiple criteria to evaluate when the rule is triggered.</li>
				<li>You can only have one THEN, which can have multiple actions to execute.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Other options include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Whether the rule should be run as the user who triggered it or a dedicated user set for the service desk project. Since not all actions can be run by the user who triggers them, especially if the user is a customer, it is safer to use the project’s default option.</li>
				<li>Whether the<a id="_idIndexMarker999"/> rule can be triggered by another automation rule. This is very useful as it allows you to chain multiple rules together to automate your process. However, you need to be careful and make sure you do not have rules that will trigger off each other and get stuck in a loop.</li>

			<p>In this chapter, you learned how to use Jira Service Management to transform Jira into a powerful service desk solution. Jira Service Management is based on many of Jira’s out-of-the-box features, such as a workflow engine and search query (JQL), and provides a brand new user interface to remove the friction caused by the old Jira interface. This makes the overall experience a lot more pleasant for customers.</p>
			<p>We looked at how you can customize the branding for your customer portal, as well as how to group request types, which can help your customers to better navigate around. We also explored using SLAs to help measure metrics for your support team. Lastly, we looked at ways you can set up automation rules to help your support process run more efficiently. In the next chapter, we will take a deeper look into how you can extend Jira’s features and capabilities using third-party apps.</p>
