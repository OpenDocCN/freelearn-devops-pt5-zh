- en: We already saw how Docker Swarm provides self-healing applied to services. If
    a replica of a service goes down, it will be rescheduled on one of the healthy
    nodes. Soon after, the desired number of replicas will be running inside the cluster.
    We combined that feature with volumes attached to network drives so that the state
    of the stateful services is persisted.

- en: The time has come to explore how to accomplish the same self-healing features
    applied to infrastructure. We already know how to create a cluster based on the
    *Docker For AWS* template or its equivalent in *Azure*. If you are not using one
    of those hosting vendors, we explored the essential features you should implement
    yourself.

- en: Before we move into infrastructure self-healing, we need to create the cluster
    we destroyed at the end of the previous chapter. We’ll use this opportunity to
    explore how to accomplish the same result without the usage of AWS UI.

    on your name from the top-right menu, and select *My Security Credentials*. You
    will see the screen with different types of credentials. Expand the *Access Keys
    (Access Key ID and Secret Access Key)* section and click the *Create New Access
    Key* button. Expand the *Show Access Key* section to see the keys.
