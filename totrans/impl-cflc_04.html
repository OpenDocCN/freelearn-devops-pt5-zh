<h1 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Collaborating with Your Team</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll create a team space using what we’ve learned so far. First, let’s get to know the team. The team consists of five people who work from different countries in different time zones. It is not easy for them to come together physically, and they need a productive, collaborative workspace. Just like a physical office, they want to come together to discuss and share information. We will create this space virtually and put it at the team’s service. We will learn how to create a space and configure it properly, so that you can configure all team spaces within your company. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Preparing a team space</li>
<li>Collaborating with your team</li>
<li>Managing meetings</li>
<li>Managing decisions</li>
<li>Inspiring ideas for your team space</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>You will need the following software and requirements to complete this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date web browser</li>
<li>An active subscription to Confluence Cloud Premium</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Preparing a team space</h1>
<p>Here, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>create a space in which a team can collaborate. This virtual space is similar to a physical office where people can communicate with each other and work together. We need this space because it will be the home for all the content that your team will need.</p>
<p>We also want this space to have the following properties:</p>
<ul>
<li>We want transparency. All content must be accessible to everyone unless specifically indicated.</li>
<li>All information should be collaboratively recorded, shared, and updated.</li>
<li>This space must be a single source of truth for our team.</li>
<li>This area should accelerate the adaptation of newcomers to the team.</li>
<li>It should contribute to fostering trust between team members.</li>
<li>We ought to minimize outdated information or do parallel work.</li>
<li>We need to switch between tools to find documents.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meanwhile, we want<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> this space to contain the following content:</p>
<ul>
<li>A home page to welcome the team</li>
<li>Contact information of team members</li>
<li>Information about the team (mission, rules, etc.)</li>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Announcements</li>
<li>Recently updated content</li>
<li>Meeting notes</li>
<li>Decisions</li>
<li>Shortcuts</li>
</ul>
<p>To create a new space, follow the path from the top menu of Confluence. Click on <strong class="bold">Spaces</strong> and then <strong class="bold">Create space</strong>. Select <strong class="bold">Team space</strong> from the pop-up window and click <strong class="bold">Next</strong> as shown:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_01_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.1 – Choosing a space template</p>
<p>As you can see, there <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>are a number of space templates that you can choose. They are similar, but it is helpful to be aware of the minor differences. Here, we choose <strong class="bold">Team space</strong> because we want to collaborate and share resources with our team.</p>
<p>In the opened window, there are three things you must do:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add an icon for your space. You can choose it from the icon library or upload an image.</li>
<li>Create and enter the name of your space. <code>Team Blue</code> is an example.</li>
<li>Identify this space with a key. By default, Confluence proposes you with one. You can also set a custom key. Enter a value that contains only A-Z, a-z, or 0-9 characters here. For example, this could be TeamBlue or <code>TB</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here are some tips on space keys:</p>
<ul>
<li>Space keys may only consist of ASCII letters or numbers (A-Z, a-z, 0-9)</li>
<li>This is used in your space URL</li>
<li>You cannot change the space key once it is set</li>
</ul>
<p>So, choose your space key carefully. Now, we are ready to create a team space:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_02_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.2 – Configuring your team space</p>
<p>As you can see, Confluence <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>gives you options for space permissions. We want this space to be visible to the whole team, so let’s choose the second option, <strong class="bold">Default permissions</strong> (use the space permissions set by your admin). Now, let’s hit the <strong class="bold">Create </strong><strong class="bold">space</strong> button.</p>
<p>Your team space is almost ready. It’s time to deep dive into this newly created space:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_03_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.3 – Overview page of the newly created team space</p>
<p>As you can see, Confluence has created and populated an <strong class="bold">Overview</strong> page inside your team space. This is<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> what people see first when they view your team space. The <strong class="bold">Overview</strong> pages include all the titles, shortcuts, links, and guiding notes, which are customizable according to your needs.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Search (live search macro)</h2>
<p>A search bar is <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>integrated into your team space’s <strong class="bold">Overview</strong> page, allowing you to find knowledge within your space.</p>
<p>You may notice that there is another search bar in your interface’s top-right section. But this is quite different from the one that is integrated into the page. The search bar located at the top of the screen is for global searching (across all spaces) within Confluence. This powerful search bar is even capable of searching across multiple Atlassian products such as Jira and Bitbucket:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_04_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.4 – Searching for a page</p>
<p>As seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.4</em>, there is a search bar on the <strong class="bold">Overview</strong> page of your space.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Team</h2>
<p>We recommend you <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>add the following information about the whole team to this area:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name and surname</li>
<li>Contact information (Slack, phone, email, city, etc.)</li>
<li>Photograph</li>
<li>Title/role</li>
<li>Team <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>news</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Blog</h2>
<p>There is a blog <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>feature within your space. You can use it to manage your team’s news. Note that you should prepare a separate blog post for each piece of news. You can then have these blog posts automatically listed on the home page. Note that the blog feature can be easily disabled in the space settings:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_05_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.5 – Creating a blog post</p>
<p>You may have <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>noticed that it is possible to easily create a blog post with the <strong class="bold">Create a blog</strong> button on the sidebar of your team space.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Recently updated</h2>
<p>Here, Confluence<a id="_idIndexMarker347"/> automatically lists recently updated content. This way, you won’t miss the team’s latest updated content:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_06_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.6 – Recently updated</p>
<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.6</em>, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>see that there is a list of the five most recently updated pages in your space. You can customize this section by clicking the pencil-shaped <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> button at the bottom of this macro. The Edit interface is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.7</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_07_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.7 – Editing the recently updated macro</p>
<p>As seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.7</em>, you<a id="_idIndexMarker349"/> have many options for customizing the <strong class="bold">Recently Updated</strong> macro. You can set which spaces’ pages will be shown by the macro or which pages updated by certain users will be displayed. Also, you can ensure that only pages with specific labels are listed by this macro.</p>
<p>Now that we have created a space, configured it according to the basic needs of the team, and covered the different elements of the space, we are now ready to collaborate on the content.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Collaborating with your team</h1>
<p>At first, Confluence <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>may seem like a typical text processor, but it has a unique philosophy: Confluence is entirely based on cooperation. The priority here is not just to store the text in a cloud but also to manage information collaboratively. The interface and the features are designed according to this philosophy. In Confluence, all of the content is created, updated, and developed collectively. It is visible and collectively shared unless stated otherwise.</p>
<p>In Confluence, each element (pages, attachments, comments, etc.) is optimized for collaborative work. Many of the features that enable collaboration on Confluence are quite simple yet very powerful so that you can use the interactions here in a small team of 5 people or a large company of 10,000 people.</p>
<p>In Confluence, you can do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop content collaboratively</li>
<li>Discuss an entire document</li>
<li>Brainstorm on a specific region of a document</li>
<li>Send a specific part of a document to your team</li>
<li>Present on a document</li>
<li>Get instantly informed about the changes on a page and notify others</li>
<li>Refer to a colleague or the entire team in a specific section of a document</li>
</ul>
<p>You can perform these actions synchronously (simultaneously) or asynchronously (at different times).</p>
<p>While providing an effective collaboration environment, Confluence quietly manages many technical processes in the background such as backup, automatic recording, monitoring of changes, versioning, and analytics. This allows you to concentrate primarily on collaboration.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Mastering commenting on a Confluence page</h2>
<p>There are two <a id="_idIndexMarker351"/>types of comments:</p>
<ul>
<li>Page comments</li>
<li>Inline comments</li>
</ul>
<p>Before diving into the details, let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> first create a sample page and add sample content. To start with, click the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button on the top navigation.</p>
<p>Let’s set the page’s name as <code>Sample</code> <code>page</code>. Now, add sample content and press the <strong class="bold">Publish</strong> button:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_08_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.8 – Creating a sample page</p>
<p>As you can see, we now have a page on which we can add comments. Note that only users with comment permission can add a comment on a Confluence page.</p>
<h3>Page comments</h3>
<p>You can add comments to a page or blog post, and your colleagues can react to your comments or reply to them.</p>
<p>Let’s add a comment to the page:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_09_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.9 – Adding a page comment</p>
<p>Note that<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> the content you can add to the comment area includes images, links, other Confluence pages, Jira links, tables, and files. You can even refer to your teammates here:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_10_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.10 – Page comments</p>
<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.10</em>, page comments are visible at the bottom of the page. Remember, comments can only be viewed in view mode, they are not visible when you're in edit mode. This is where inline comments become practical.</p>
<h3>Inline comments</h3>
<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>comment by selecting any part of the page or blog content. Let’s see how.</p>
<p>First, let’s select a word, a sentence, or a paragraph on the page and press the <strong class="bold">Comment</strong> button in the window that opens:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_11_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.11 – Creating a comment</p>
<p>As you can see, we just selected a word and we want to add a comment on that word. We can type our comments in the window that opens. We can also add links and refer to teammates:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_12_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.12 – Creating a comment (continued)</p>
<p>As you can see, Confluence <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>highlights the selected word, making comments easily noticeable. Typically, all comments are hidden when the page is opened. To make them visible, you should click on the highlighted section of the content:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_13_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.13 – Reacting to a comment</p>
<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>may have noticed, all comments are listed in chronological order. Once you and your teammates have finished discussing a highlighted section of the page, you can archive your comments by pressing the <strong class="bold">Resolve</strong> button. This way, resolved comments become invisible. You can always access them when you need them. You can access resolved comments by clicking the <strong class="bold">Show resolved comments</strong> button on the top right.</p>
<p>Inline comments have a shorter lifespan than page comments. When someone resolves a comment, they dissolve and disappear from the page, but they’re never lost unless intentionally deleted. You can easily copy the link to a specific comment when you want to use it in another environment such as Jira or Slack.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_14_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.14 – Copying the link to an inline comment</p>
<p>Here, you <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>can easily access and copy the link.</p>
<p>Inline comments can be viewed and added in both edit and view modes.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Reactions</h2>
<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>react to a page with emojis.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Sharing page</h2>
<p>Click the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> button<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> at the top right of the display to share the page with your teammates:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_15_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.15 – Sharing a page</p>
<p>You can easily share the page with a colleague or an entire team so that they will receive an email notification including the page link and your message. You can also easily share your page with Slack. If you want to share the page from Teams, Jira, or any other platform, you can quickly get the link to the page by using the <strong class="bold">Copy </strong><strong class="bold">link</strong> button.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Watching a page</h2>
<p>You can start <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>watching a page if you want to receive email updates about changes made on this page:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_16_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.16 – Watching a page</p>
<p>As you can see, you <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>can start watching all content in a single space with a single click. Once you decide not to get updates about a page, click the <strong class="bold">Stop watching</strong> button and simply stop watching.</p>
<p>You have now learned how to interact and collaborate with your teammates using Confluence. It’s time to work on a practical scenario where we can apply what we’ve learned: facilitating meeting management with Confluence.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>What is a Confluence macro?</h2>
<p>Confluence Cloud <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>offers a variety of macros to help users enhance their content and collaborate more effectively. Macros are small pieces of reusable content or functionality that <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>can be added to a page or blog post. Here are some commonly used macros in Confluence Cloud:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Page Tree</code>: Displays a navigable hierarchy of pages. This is useful for creating a table of contents or sidebar navigation.</li>
<li><code>Table of Contents</code>: Generates a table of contents for a page based on the headings used.</li>
<li><code>Excerpt</code>: Marks a portion of a page’s content to be reused in another page using the <code>Excerpt </code><code>Include</code> macro.</li>
<li><code>Excerpt Include</code>: Displays content marked as an excerpt from another page.</li>
<li><code>Info, Note, Tip, Warning</code>: Used to highlight information, notes, tips, or warnings in a distinctive box.</li>
<li><code>Code Block</code>: Displays a block of code with syntax highlighting.</li>
<li><code>Gallery</code>: Displays a gallery of attached images.</li>
<li><code>Decision</code>: Allows you to record decisions made during a meeting.</li>
<li><code>Status</code>: Displays a colored lozenge (status) that you can customize.</li>
<li><code>Jira Issues</code>: Displays a list of Jira issues on a page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Users can add macros to a page while editing it. To add a macro, click on the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon at the bottom of the page editor and select the macro you want to add. Confluence Cloud also supports user-installed apps that may provide additional macros.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that some macros may not be available to all users as they may be restricted by the administrator or require a specific subscription.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Managing meetings</h1>
<p>No matter how <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>many participants there are, meetings, in different settings, will always exist in our lives. Whether you work in an office or with a distributed team, you must work on effectiveness. Confluence can help you plan your meetings to be organized only when necessary to protect valuable time and reach goals faster.</p>
<p>Confluence can help you with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reducing the number of meetings</li>
<li>Organizing more productive meetings</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Reducing the number of meetings</h2>
<p>You can have <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>fewer meetings using the features we learned about on Confluence. Let’s look at how you can reduce the number of meetings through two different scenarios.</p>
<h3>Scenario 1</h3>
<p>You’re dealing with an important contract that you need to finalize and are expecting full participation from your team.</p>
<p>The traditional solution, which we don’t recommend, is, “Let’s organize a meeting and distribute a copy of the contract to everyone. Let’s get everyone’s opinion during the meeting.”</p>
<p>Our proposed solution, on the other hand, would be saying, “Let’s not have a meeting. Let’s turn the agreement into a Confluence page instead and ask the team to add comments within a specific time range. Let’s use inline comments to discuss the document, resolve discussions, and make the necessary revisions.”</p>
<h3>Scenario 2</h3>
<p>You want to make an important decision for the company, and you expect full participation from your team in this matter.</p>
<p>The traditional solution would sound like, “Let’s organize a meeting and get everyone’s opinion in turn at that meeting.”</p>
<p>Instead, we recommend saying, “Let’s not have a meeting. Let’s gather all the information we need and the possible risks related to this decision in a Confluence document. Ask the team to add their comments on the decision as inline comments and review them within a specific timeframe. When the due date comes, then we’ll make a decision as a team.”</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Organizing more productive meetings</h2>
<p>With Confluence, you <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>can make your meetings more <a id="_idIndexMarker368"/>effective and avoid wasting time and resources. We have three suggestions to make this possible.</p>
<h3>Gather everything about the meeting in a single page</h3>
<p>Create a <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>Confluence page for each meeting and put everything we have about that meeting on this page. Then, share this page with the whole team before the meeting. Let’s not waste time with cool presentation tools and programs; hold the meeting directly on this page. Also, update this page together during the meeting.</p>
<h3>Use templates to get up to speed</h3>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>ready-to-use templates on Confluence are designed to help us save time and improve our meeting culture. It is also possible to build our own template library by developing existing templates or starting from scratch.</p>
<p>Confluence has six different <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>meeting document templates in its template library. Most of them were designed by Atlassian while others were made by companies that are highly experienced in remote working, such as Miro.</p>
<p>Let’s now explore three of the templates Confluence provides:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Meeting Notes</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Weekly </strong><strong class="bold">Meeting Notes</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Sprint </strong><strong class="bold">Planning Meeting</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Use the Meeting Notes template</h3>
<p>This one is <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>probably one of Confluence’s <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>most popular templates, and it can be used for many types of meetings. Let’s see what this meeting template looks like:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_17_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.17 – The Meeting Notes template by Atlassian</p>
<p>As you can see, this template consists of many different parts. Let’s go over the essential elements of <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>this template:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Date</strong>: We can add <a id="_idIndexMarker375"/>the meeting date here using Confluence’s <strong class="bold">Date</strong> macro.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Participants</strong>: Here, we write down the names of the participants. If they have a Confluence license, Confluence will suggest their names after you enter a few letters. The people you add here will be notified immediately of all changes made to the document.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Goals</strong>: Before the meeting, we agree on the goals and summarize these goals in two or three items at the most. This way, we can avoid long meetings and protect participants’ time.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Discussion topics</strong>: We add the topics that will be discussed at the meeting one by one. We determine the order in which these subjects will be covered, how much time we will devote to each topic, and who will present each topic. We can also add any content that could be useful before and during the meeting in the notes section.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Action items</strong>: Here, we add the pieces of work that need to be done before, during, or after the meeting. We can also add a deadline and a responsibility for this job.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Decisions</strong>: We record the final decisions in this area.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Discovering the weekly Meeting Notes template</h3>
<p>Since creating <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>separate documents for a <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>meeting can be unsustainable, we recommend using this template, which can be very practical for the type of meetings that are frequently held. For example, this template can be handy for meetings that are held every morning because it keeps all your meeting notes in one place for the week, month, or sprint. Let’s see what this template looks like:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_18_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.18 – The Weekly Meeting template</p>
<p>As you can see, this template has three parts: <code>Meeting overview</code>, <code>Open action item</code>s, and <code>Meeting minutes</code>. As the first two areas are quite self-explanatory, we will only describe the last part.</p>
<p>We <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>create a row for each agenda item. For <a id="_idIndexMarker379"/>each line, we add the following information: <strong class="bold">Date</strong>, <strong class="bold">Attendees</strong>, <strong class="bold">Agenda</strong>, <strong class="bold">Notes</strong>, <strong class="bold">decisions</strong>, and <strong class="bold">action items</strong>.</p>
<p>This section is similar to the <strong class="bold">Discussion topics</strong> section of the previous template, but there is a fundamental difference: this table is designed to organize many consecutive meetings in one table, and you can use an empty row with a gray background to separate the meetings visually.</p>
<h3>Sprint Planning Meeting template</h3>
<p>Since this is <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>an advanced template <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>designed by Atlassian, we will only introduce the modules that we find most important:</p>
<ul>
<li>Table of contents</li>
<li>Sprint planning checklist</li>
<li>Sprint team members</li>
<li>Capacity planning</li>
<li>Potential risks</li>
</ul>
<h4>Table of contents</h4>
<p>You can see the table <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>of contents of the template in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_19_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.19 – Table of contents</p>
<p>As you can see, this<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> template has a table of contents at the very beginning that automatically updates itself. At this point, one can ask, “Why would a meeting note have a table of contents?”</p>
<p>Sprint plannings are complex meetings; therefore, they require excellent preparation. Typically, critical information is shared during this type of meeting, and you do not want it to disappear. Thus, the notes of this meeting can be really long and intense. That’s why a self-updating table of contents becomes handy to make the work more visible and practical for the team to navigate such a document.</p>
<h4>Sprint planning checklist</h4>
<p>You can utilize Confluence to make your sprint planning meetings with your team more effective. The table in this document section lets you visualize tasks that must be done before, during, and after the meeting. We recommend using the action item macros here.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_20_B16861.jpg"/>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.20 – Sprint planning checklist</p>
<p><em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.20</em> displays <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>the checklist. As sprint planning meetings require serious planning, it is beneficial to use a checklist to avoid forgetting the important items in the meeting. The macro used here to capture work items is the same one we saw in the previous templates. Also, note that you can also set deadlines or assign responsibilities for this part.</p>
<h4>Sprint team members</h4>
<p>In this section, you <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>should list all the team members who will participate in the sprint:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_21_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.21 – Sprint team members</p>
<p>Here, you <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>can also define team members’ roles. Once you type your teammates’ names starting with <code>@</code>, they will be immediately notified of every change in this document.</p>
<h4>Capacity planning</h4>
<p>You <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>can keep the capacity metrics of the current sprint in this section:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_22_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.22 – Capacity planning</p>
<p>Keeping the<a id="_idIndexMarker388"/> capacity metrics visible for the previous few sprints can be practical.</p>
<h4>Potential risks</h4>
<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>this section, you can display a basic risk assessment of the sprint:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_23_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figures 4.23 – Potential risks</p>
<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>can see in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.23</em>, there are two columns in this table. While the risk is defined in the first column, the mitigation plan is displayed on the right side.</p>
<h3>Atlassian’s other resources for meetings</h3>
<p>Atlassian has <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>created many valuable resources for meetings. You can find some of them at the end of this chapter.</p>
<p>In this section, we discussed how to organize effective meetings with Confluence and suggested that meeting-related content be compiled into a single document. We also introduced templates to make this all possible. Now, we are ready to manage decisions with Confluence.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Managing decisions</h1>
<p>Teams have to <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>consistently make decisions for different objectives, and we are aware that recording, announcing, archiving, and managing these decisions is not always easy. At this point, Confluence has features that will help a distributed team carry out the decision-making process with full participation. In this section, we’ll talk about two macros (<code>Decision</code> <code>and</code> <code>Decision Report</code>) to keep track of both small and complex decisions and to make them more manageable and effective.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Using Decision for simple decisions</h2>
<p>You can easily <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>capture and keep track of your simple decisions using the <code>Decision</code> macro. You can access this macro in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button from the menu located at the top of your page editing screen, then click on <strong class="bold">Decision</strong> from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Use the <code>/decision </code><code>keyboard</code> shortcut:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_24_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.24 – Adding a decision</p>
<p>As you can see, we just captured two decisions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Using Decision Report to list decisions</h2>
<p>You can use<a id="_idIndexMarker394"/> the <code>Decision</code> <code>Report</code> macro to list decisions scattered across different documents in your team space in one place. You can add this macro to the page in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Press the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button from the menu on top of your page and click on <strong class="bold">Decision Report</strong> from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Use the <code>/Decision Report</code> keyboard shortcut:</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_25_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.25 – Decision Report</p>
<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>can see in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.25</em>, decisions from different pages are displayed in a single table. On the left side, you can see on which page the decision is. On the right, you can see the decision itself.</p>
<p>When you press the pencil-shaped <code>Decision Report</code> macro, you will reach the <strong class="bold">Edit ‘Decision report’ Macro</strong> interface, which can be seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4</em><em class="italic">.26</em>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_26_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.26 – Edit ‘Decision report’ Macro</p>
<p>As seen in the <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>previous screenshot, you can customize the <code>Decision Report</code> macro according to your needs. You can set how many decisions will appear in the report or which spaces’ decisions will be displayed in this report.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Using templates for managing complex decisions</h2>
<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>three templates on Confluence to prepare for complex decisions. Here, we will examine the template named <code>DACI: </code><code>Decision documentation</code>.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this template, there is a table where we keep a record of the essential information about the decision:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_27_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.27 – Decision properties</p>
<p>As you can <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>see, you can add names to the relevant table to involve the decision stakeholders. In this way, responsibilities become more visible and it is ensured that all stakeholders are immediately informed of changes to this document. This template also has a section where you can add relevant data and background information to provide context when making decisions. You can add rich content to this area:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_28_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.28 – Relevant data and Background for a decision</p>
<p>When evaluating a complex decision, you may want to assess the alternatives in a table and compare them. You can use the <strong class="bold">Options considered</strong> section to do so:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_04_29_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 4.29 – Options considered</p>
<p>This table <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>looks simple enough, but it can assist you in more complicated scenarios.</p>
<p>In this section, we discussed how you can contribute to interactive decision management in your team using Confluence. The two macros and three templates we mentioned here can help you to quickly set up a simple and effective decision-management system for your team. Also, please note that these templates are just reference points; you can always adapt them to your ever-changing needs.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Inspiring ideas for your team space</h1>
<p>You can add a lot of <a id="_idIndexMarker400"/>content other than meeting notes and resolutions to the team area. “What can we put in?” we hear you ask. You can add any content the team will probably need. Let's take a look at some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team goals and objectives (OKRs)</li>
<li>Team rules</li>
<li>Team metrics (KPI's)</li>
<li>Roadmap</li>
<li>Frequently used links</li>
<li>Links to other software you use such as Miro, Canva, Google Workspace</li>
<li>All kinds <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>of files such as <code>.ppt</code>, <code>.excel</code>, <code>.pdf</code>, <code>.word</code>, or <code>.zip</code></li>
<li>Brainstorming notes</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we saw how Confluence can support a distributed team in collaboration. First, we created a team space containing all the information the team will need. Then, we provided a brief <strong class="bold">Overview</strong> page in this space and learned how to interact with our teammates, including important topics such as collaborative capturing, editing, and sharing information. Finally, after discussing how to manage meetings and decisions with Confluence, we also discovered powerful Confluence features such as templates and macros. Now, using all this new information, you can provide your teams with a solid workspace where they can collaborate while working remotely. In the next chapter, we will learn how to use macros to easily manage dynamic content.</p>
