All the support tickets are tracked using a JIRA project, but, it comes with a customer portal that makes it really easy to raise requests. Also, JIRA Service Desk can be integrated with Confluence and users can easily search for related issues while raising new tickets.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Product overview—JIRA Service Desk?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing JIRA Service Desk</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl1sec92"/>Product overview – JIRA Service Desk?</h1></div></div></div><p>In <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Planning Your JIRA Installation">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Planning Your JIRA Installation</em>, we discussed the new JIRA 7, which was split into three separate applications called JIRA Core, JIRA Software, and JIRA Service Desk. In <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6.  Sample Implementation of Use Cases">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Sample Implementation of Use Cases</em>, we discussed some sample use cases of JIRA and in <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Customizing JIRA for Test Management">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Customizing JIRA for Test Management</em>, we also looked at how JIRA can be customized for test management. Similarly, JIRA can also be configured for support requests, but in that case, only users who have a JIRA account can log in to raise requests. In cases where there is a need to have unlimited customers who can create tickets, JIRA Service Desk can be used. JIRA Service Desk does not impose any limit on the customers and it also comes with the standard features of a typical support and ticketing system.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl1sec93"/>Installing JIRA Service Desk</h1></div></div></div><p>In case you only want to use JIRA for support projects, you can download and install the JIRA Service Desk application. The procedure to install it is similar to that of JIRA Software, which we discussed in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Planning Your JIRA Installation">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Planning Your JIRA Installation</em>. However, if you are already using JIRA Core or JIRA Software in your organization, you can still install the JIRA Service Desk application over your existing instance. Follow the steps mentioned here to install the JIRA Service Desk application on your existing JIRA instance:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Download the latest version of JIRA Service Desk available. You will get a <code class="literal">jira-servicedesk-application-3.1.7.obr</code> file at <a class="ulink" href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.servicedesk.application/versions">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.servicedesk.application/versions</a>.</li><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Applications</strong> | <strong>Versions &amp; licenses</strong>. On this screen, you will get the list of all the applications such as JIRA Core and JIRA Software that are already installed. Click on the <strong>Upload an application</strong> link in the top-right corner and in the <strong>Upload application</strong> popup that appears, upload the <code class="literal">jira-servicedesk-application-3.1.7.obr</code> file that you just downloaded:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_001.jpg" alt="Installing JIRA Service Desk"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">JIRA Service Desk will be installed. You can also generate an evaluation license for it. Once the license is installed you will be able to create a new Service Desk project:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_002.jpg" alt="Installing JIRA Service Desk"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Go to the navigation menu at the top of the screen and then click on <strong>Projects</strong> | <strong>Create project</strong>. On the <strong>Create project</strong> popup, select <strong>IT Service Desk</strong> under <strong>SERVICE DESK</strong> and press the <strong>Next</strong> button to continue:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_003.jpg" alt="Installing JIRA Service Desk"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the <strong>IT Service Desk</strong> popup, enter project <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Key</strong>, and press the <strong>Submit</strong> button to continue:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_004.jpg" alt="Installing JIRA Service Desk"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">A new project with the Service Desk type will be created now. A typical Service Desk project will be quite similar to a standard JIRA project, but it comes with some additional features:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_005.jpg" alt="Installing JIRA Service Desk"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Once the project is created, you will be greeted with a <strong>Welcome guide</strong>, which contains several links to Atlassian documentation to get you familiar with Service Desk. In the project sidebar there are three tabs: <strong>Queues</strong>, <strong>Customers</strong>, and <strong>Reports</strong>. Let us understand each of them.</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl2sec127"/>Queues</h2></div></div></div><p>A queue is simply a filtered list of issues based on predefined conditions. For instance, there are several queues already defined in your project, such as <strong>Unassigned issues</strong>, <strong>Assigned to me</strong>, <strong>Due in 24h</strong>, and more.</p><p>Queues are somewhat similar to JIRA filters. You can also create your own queues. Click on the <strong>New queue</strong> link, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_006.jpg" alt="Queues"/></div><p>
</p><p>On the <strong>New queue</strong> screen, enter <strong>Name</strong> as <code class="literal">In Progress</code>, and, under <strong>Issues to show</strong>, select <strong>Status</strong> as <strong>In Progress</strong>. If you are familiar with JQL then click on the <strong>Advanced</strong> link right next to the <strong>Issues to show</strong> section. Press the <strong>Create</strong> button to save the queue:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_007.jpg" alt="Queues"/></div><p>
</p><p>The queue will now be saved and available in the existing list of <strong>QUEUES</strong> in your project.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl2sec128"/>Customers</h2></div></div></div><p>Your Service Desk project is, by default, open for <strong>everyone with an account</strong> in your JIRA instance, but we can limit which user or group will be the <strong>Customers</strong>, and can raise requests in this project:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_008.jpg" alt="Customers"/></div><p>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl2sec129"/>Reports</h2></div></div></div><p>The Service Desk project comes with some really good inbuilt reports that will help you understand the current progress of your team working on the support project:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_009.jpg" alt="Reports"/></div><p>
</p><p>Let us understand the purpose of these reports.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec50"/>Workload</h3></div></div></div><p>This is a simple report that shows the number of requests your team is working on right now. It will help you to evenly distribute the workload among your agents. The reports display the number of <strong>Issues in progress</strong> for each agent. This is an important report, which helps the project lead to evenly distribute the work among agents so they are not under- or over-allocated.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec51"/>SLA goals</h3></div></div></div><p>Service Desk comes with <strong>Service Level Agreement</strong> (<strong>SLA</strong>) such as <strong>Time to first response</strong> and <strong>Time to resolution</strong>. This report will tell you if your team is able to achieve these SLA goals or not. The report displays the percentage of successful achievement of the SLA in the last seven days. These reports can quickly tell how the team is performing with regard to resolving the issues, which are measured by time-bound goals.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec52"/>Satisfaction</h3></div></div></div><p>This report will display the average customer satisfaction level. This helps you to understand whether your customers are happy with your service or not. It displays an average of the ratings given by users. It is a nice and quick way to get general feedback from users and can help to understand their satisfaction levels.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec53"/>Article usage</h3></div></div></div><p>If you have linked a Confluence space with your project, then this report shows the number of times articles were viewed and how many customers found those articles useful. JIRA Service Desk is closely integrated with Confluence spaces; it provides the related articles to the user while they are raising a new request, which might be a known issue or a very common request. In such cases, an article in the linked Confluence space can help the users self-service themselves.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec54"/>Article effectiveness</h3></div></div></div><p>This report shows the number of issues created by customers versus the number of issues customers solved themselves by viewing the articles. Understanding how many times users referred to the linked Confluence space articles and helped themselves by reading them can give you an idea of the effectiveness of those articles.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec55"/>Created vs Resolved</h3></div></div></div><p>This reports displays the number of issues <strong>Created vs Resolved</strong> for the selected duration, such as <strong>Past 7 days</strong>, <strong>Past 14 days</strong>, or <strong>Past 30 days</strong>. A similar report is usually present in non-JIRA Service Desk projects too.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec56"/>Time to resolution</h3></div></div></div><p>This report shows how much time is taken to resolve all the issues, along with how much time is taken to resolve an issue of a particular type, such as <strong>Incidents</strong>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec57"/>Incidents reported by priority</h3></div></div></div><p>A count of issues based on individual priorities is displayed in this report. It is useful to get a quick glance of the issue count broken up by their priorities, such as <strong>Highest</strong>, <strong>High</strong>, <strong>Medium</strong>, <strong>Low</strong>, and <strong>Lowest</strong>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec58"/>SLA met vs breached</h3></div></div></div><p>A simple count of how many issues achieved their SLA goal versus how many issues did not achieve their SLA goals or, in other words, breached. Along with the <strong>SLA goals</strong> reports, this report tells you how many tickets in the project were not able to achieve their SLA goal.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl2sec130"/>Customer channels</h2></div></div></div><p>There are two ways customers can raise tickets in the project—<strong>Customer portal</strong>, or <strong>Email</strong>. Let us discuss them in detail:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_010.jpg" alt="Customer channels"/></div><p>
</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec59"/>Customer portal</h3></div></div></div><p>The most important purpose of the Service Desk application is to focus on support requests and ticketing systems to cater to the requests of end users and customers. Using JIRA, a simple project can be created to track the issues and access can be given to the customers provided there are enough licenses, but, in general, the end users may not find it intuitive to log in to an issue tracker to raise their requests. Atlassian understood this concern and created the Service Desk application with a dedicated <strong>Customer portal</strong>, which is a neat and simple interface for raising support requests.</p><p>Every Service Desk project will have its own <strong>Customer portal</strong> URL like the one mentioned here <code class="literal">http://localhost/servicedesk/customer/portal/1</code>.</p><p>You will find this URL when you click on the <strong>Customer channels</strong> tab in the project sidebar. The project-specific URL will be displayed in the popup that appears,. You can share this URL with your customers, or publish it on your website. <strong>Customer portal</strong> offers a simple and intuitive interface to raise the request. Let us go through this portal. Open this URL in your web browser:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_011.jpg" alt="Customer portal"/></div><p>
</p><p>On the left-hand side, five <strong>Groups</strong> are listed and, under each of them, several requests types, such as <strong>Report a system problem</strong>, <strong>Get IT help</strong>, and <strong>Request a new account</strong> are grouped. These request types are actually assigned to a specific issue type in JIRA. We can create a new request type and map it to any existing issue type.</p><p>Click on <strong>Report a system problem</strong> and it will open a new page with a form to raise a request:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_012.jpg" alt="Customer portal"/></div><p>
</p><p>This form is something similar to the one that opens when you click on the <strong>Create</strong> button in JIRA, but it is much simpler. Customers can fill in this form and click on the <strong>Create</strong> button to raise the request:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_013.jpg" alt="Customer portal"/></div><p>
</p><p>Once the request is submitted, a JIRA issue is created with the status <strong>WAITING FOR SUPPORT</strong>. Each Service Desk project has its own workflow, just like any other JIRA project. The issue will start appearing in the <strong>Queues</strong> of the project.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec60"/>E-mail</h3></div></div></div><p>You can configure Service Desk in such a way that your customers can raise tickets by simply sending an e-mail to a specific e-mail address. We need to configure our project first to enable this functionality.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Set up email requests</strong> link in the popup that appears when you click on the <strong>Customer channels</strong> tab on the project sidebar:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_014.jpg" alt="E-mail"/></div><p>
</p><p>On the next screen, click on the <strong>Add an email address</strong> button:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_015.jpg" alt="E-mail"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Set up email channel</strong> popup, enter the details of your e-mail account. If you are using a Google apps account, enter <strong>Email address</strong> and <strong>Password</strong>, but you can also configure POP- and IMAP-based accounts from the <strong>Other</strong> tab. Press the <strong>Next</strong> button to continue:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_016.jpg" alt="E-mail"/></div><p>
</p><p>Now you will need to select which request type will be used to create issues from e-mail. You can select <strong>Report a system problem</strong> and press the <strong>Done</strong> button at the bottom:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_017.jpg" alt="E-mail"/></div><p>
</p><p>The e-mail will now be configured for this project. JIRA Service Desk will continuously read the specified inbox and whenever there is a new mail, it will copy the e-mail subject in the <strong>Summary</strong> field and e-mail content in the <strong>Description</strong> field.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl2sec131"/>JIRA Service Desk configurations</h2></div></div></div><p>Service Desk projects are not much different from a standard JIRA project. Internally, it is also configured using various schemes for <strong>Issue types</strong>, <strong>Workflows</strong>, <strong>Screens</strong>, and <strong>Permissions</strong>. In <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Customizing JIRA for Test Management">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Customizing JIRA for Test Management</em>, we discussed how to customize the project by modifying these schemes. However, there are certain configurations that are specific to a Service Desk-based project.</p><p>Go to <strong>Project Administration</strong> of your project under the project sidebar and just below the <strong>Summary</strong>, you will notice a new set of configurations that are not present in a standard JIRA project:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_018.jpg" alt="JIRA Service Desk configurations"/></div><p>
</p><p>Let us understand them one by one.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec61"/>Request types</h3></div></div></div><p>Earlier in this chapter, we discussed how the <strong>Customer</strong> portal is a simple interface for end users. They get to choose the different types of request, which are internally mapped to a specific issue type. Under this section, you can create a new request type and also modify the existing ones:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_019.jpg" alt="Request types"/></div><p>
</p><p>Enter a <strong>Request name</strong>, such as <code class="literal">Hardware problem</code>, select <strong>Issue type</strong> as <strong>Problem</strong>, and enter text in <strong>Groups</strong> as <code class="literal">6. Miscellaneous</code>. Then press the <strong>Add</strong> button. Now, if you go back to your <strong>Customer portal</strong>, there will be a new request type added, but it will only contain the <strong>Summary</strong> field. Let us now add a few more fields to this request type:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_020.jpg" alt="Request types"/></div><p>
</p><p>Click on the <strong>Edit fields</strong> link corresponding to the request type you want to modify:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_021.jpg" alt="Request types"/></div><p>
</p><p>Now click on the <strong>Add a field</strong> button in the top-right corner of the screen:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_022.jpg" alt="Request types"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Add a field</strong> popup, select the fields that you want to add and click the <strong>Apply</strong> button:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_023.jpg" alt="Request types"/></div><p>
</p><p>The fields will now be added and will be visible to the end user on the <strong>Customer portal</strong>. You can also add a custom field in your JIRA instance and add it to the screen associated with the project. It will then be available for you to add to the request types.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec62"/>Request security</h3></div></div></div><p>You can control who can raise a support request on your Service Desk project:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_024.jpg" alt="Request security"/></div><p>
</p><p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, you have three options to select from:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Anyone can sign up for a customer account on my Customer Portal</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Only people who have an account can raise a request</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Only people on my customers list can raise a request</strong></li></ul></div><p>Select the option that is most suitable for your project and click on the <strong>Save</strong> button.</p><p>To add the users to your customer list, go to the <strong>Users and roles</strong> of your project and add the user to the <strong>SERVICE DESK CUSTOMERS</strong> project role.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec63"/>Portal settings</h3></div></div></div><p>In this section, you can change the <strong>Name</strong> of your <strong>Customer portal</strong>, which is, by default, the same as your project name. You can also upload a custom logo:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_025.jpg" alt="Portal settings"/></div><p>
</p><p>It is also possible to give an <strong>Announcement</strong> to the users, which will be displayed at the top of your <strong>Customer portal</strong>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec64"/>Satisfaction settings</h3></div></div></div><p>In the Service Desk project, your customers can give feedback. This will help you understand their satisfaction levels. Under this section, you can enable or disable this feature.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec65"/>E-mail requests</h3></div></div></div><p>Your customers can raise a request by either visiting the <strong>Customer portal</strong>, or by sending an e-mail to the address that you specify. We discussed how to configure it in the previous section on <strong>Customer channels</strong>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec66"/>Knowledge base</h3></div></div></div><p>The Service Desk projects can be integrated with a Confluence space. This is useful because, when a customer raises a request through the <strong>Customer portal</strong>, they can be presented with the related pages on Confluence. Customers can then go through those related pages and can potentially solve their problem without the need to raise a request.</p><p>To configure the <strong>Knowledge base</strong>, an application link has first to be added between JIRA and Confluence. <a class="link" href="ch16.html" title="Chapter 16. Integrating JIRA with Common Atlassian Applications and Other Tools">Chapter 16</a>, <em>Integrating JIRA with Common Atlassian Applications and Other Tools</em>, has detailed information on adding an application link. Let us take a look at how to link a Confluence space with our project:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_026.jpg" alt="Knowledge base"/></div><p>
</p><p>Under the <strong>Link a Confluence space</strong> section, select the <strong>Link to a Confluence space</strong> radio button. Then, under the <strong>Application</strong> drop-down, select <strong>Confluence</strong> and finally, under the <strong>Space</strong> drop-down, select the name of the Confluence space and click on the <strong>Link</strong> button.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec67"/>SLAs</h3></div></div></div><p>Service Desk projects comes with the following SLAs:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Time to resolution</strong>: This is the time taken from creation to resolution of the issue</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Time to first response</strong>: This is the time taken from creation to changing the status of the issue to <strong>Waiting for customer</strong></li></ul></div><p>We can also create our own SLA, such as <code class="literal">Time to Assign</code>. Follow the procedure mentioned in the following steps to create a new SLA in your project:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_027.jpg" alt="SLAs"/></div><p>
</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>New Metric</strong> link on the left-hand side.</li><li class="listitem">On the <strong>New Metric</strong> screen, enter the <strong>Name</strong> of the metric.</li><li class="listitem">Select the <strong>Start</strong> time, when the count will begin.</li><li class="listitem">Select the <strong>Stop</strong> time, when the count will finish.</li><li class="listitem">Under the <strong>Goals</strong> section, enter the <strong>Goal</strong> as <code class="literal">4h</code> for <strong>All remaining issues</strong> and click the <strong>Update</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, click the <strong>Create</strong> button at the top of the screen to save the new SLA.</li><li class="listitem">The new SLA will be reflected in all existing and new issues in your project.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl3sec68"/>Automation</h3></div></div></div><p>Service Desk projects come with a nifty utility to add some automation tasks to the project. This utility is useful to assist the team in performing some recurring tasks, and also to enforce some policies.</p><p>For instance, we just added a new SLA: <strong>Time to Assign</strong>, where an issue is assigned to an agent within 4 hours of its creation. We can actually post a comment on the request when only 60 minutes are remaining in this SLA. This comment would be visible only to the existing agents assigned on this project.</p><p>Follow the procedure given to add a new rule:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Add rule</strong> button in the top-right corner:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_028.jpg" alt="Automation"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>New automation rule</strong> popup, select <strong>Custom rule</strong> and press the <strong>Next</strong> button to continue:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_029.jpg" alt="Automation"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, enter the name, such as <code class="literal">Alert user</code>, in the first text box. We now have to <strong>Add a trigger</strong> under the <strong>WHEN</strong> box and we also have to <strong>Add an action</strong> under the <strong>THEN</strong> box.<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_030.jpg" alt="Automation"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Add a trigger</strong> link and in the <strong>Edit WHEN</strong> popup that appears, again click on the <strong>Add trigger</strong> link. Then select <strong>SLA time remaining</strong> and click the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_031.jpg" alt="Automation"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>SLA</strong> drop-down, select <strong>Time to Assign</strong> and, in <strong>Event</strong>, select <strong>Due soon (60 min remaining)</strong>. Press the <strong>Confirm</strong> button to save the trigger.</li><li class="listitem">Now click on the <strong>Add an action</strong> link and, in the <strong>Edit THEN</strong> popup that appears, again click on the <strong>Add action</strong> link. Then select <strong>Add comment</strong> and click the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_15_032.jpg" alt="Automation"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Enter a <strong>Comment text</strong>, select <strong>Comment type</strong>, and press the <strong>Confirm</strong> button.</li></ol></div><p>We have now added a new rule that will post an internal comment on the issue when the SLA is due in the next 60 minutes.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch15lvl2sec132"/>Adding users as agents</h2></div></div></div><p>The Service Desk license doesn't impose any limit on the number of customers but instead limits the number of users that can act as an agent on the project. The requests can only be assigned to an agent, and only they can communicate with the customers.</p><p>Follow the steps given here to add users as agents in your project:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">To make a user an agent, first add them in the <strong>jira-servicedesk-users</strong>, which should be assigned to the <strong>JIRA Service Desk</strong> application under the <strong>Application access</strong> section.</li><li class="listitem">Then go to <strong>Project administration</strong> | <strong>Users and roles</strong>, and add that user in the project role <strong>Service Desk Team</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, check your permission scheme.
