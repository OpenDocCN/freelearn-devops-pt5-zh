<p class="calibre3">GitHub is the leading code-hosting platform with literally millions of open source projects having their code hosted on it. In conjunction with Git, it provides the means for a productive development workflow and is the preferred tool among developers.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Starting with the basics of creating a repository, you will then learn how to manage the issue tracker, where your project can be discussed. Continuing our journey, we will explore how to use the wiki and write rich documentation that will accompany your project. Organization and team management will be the next stop, and then the pull requests, which made GitHub so well known.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, we will focus on creating simple web pages hosted on GitHub, and, lastly, we will explore the settings that are configurable for a user and a repository.</p>

The issue tracker is the heart of communication between a project's developers and/or users. Consider it to be a notepad dedicated to each repository where you track bugs, reports, feature requests, and anything else that can be written down. GitHub has implemented many other features that sit on top of the issue tracker, such as labels and milestones, which provide the ability to better visualize and categorize all the issues.</p>

You will also learn how to create a new release out of an existing branch or tag, accompanied by optional release notes. In this way, the end user can understand the changes from any previous versions.</p>

As a user, there is a lot of information you can set up in your user settings page, such as associating more than one email to your account, adding multiple SSH keys, or setting up two-factor authentication. Similarly, some functionalities of a repository can be set up via its settings page. For example, you can enable or disable the wiki pages and grant write access to the public, or completely disable the issue tracker.</p>
