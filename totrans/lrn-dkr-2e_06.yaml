- en: Debugging has been an artistic component in the field of software engineering.
    All kinds of software building blocks individually, as well as collectively, need
    to go through a stream of deeper and decisive investigations by software development
    and testing professionals to ensure the security and safety of the resulting software
    applications. As Docker containers are said to be key runtime environments for
    next generation mission-critical software workloads, it is pertinent and paramount
    for containers, crafters, and composers to embark on a systematic and sagacious
    verification and validation of containers.

    all the accurate and relevant information to meticulously debug both the applications
    running inside containers and the containers themselves. In this chapter, we will
    also look at the theoretical aspects of process isolation for processes running
    as containers. A Docker container runs at a user-level process on host machines
    and typically has the same isolation level as provided by the operating system.
    With the latest Docker releases, many debugging tools are available which can
    be efficiently used to debug your applications. We will also cover the primary
    Docker debugging tools, such as `docker exec`, `stats`, `ps`, `top`, `events`,
    and `logs`. The current version of Docker is written in Go and it takes advantage
    of several features of the Linux kernel to deliver its functionality.

    a single system (bare metal or VM) is effectively partitioned to run multiple
    services simultaneously without interfering with each other. These services must
    be isolated from each other in order to prevent them from stepping on each other''s
    resources or dependency conflict (also known as dependency hell). The Docker container
    technology essentially achieves process-level isolation by leveraging the Linux
    kernel constructs, such as namespaces and cgroups, particularly, the namespaces.

    usage. You can access these metrics and obtain network usage metrics as well.
    Cgroups are another important component of Linux containers. Cgroups have been
    around for a while and were initially merged into the Linux kernel code 2.6.24\.
    They ensure that each Docker container will get a fixed amount of memory, CPU,
    and disk I/O, so that any container will not able to bring the host machine down
    at any point of time under any circumstances. Cgroups do not play a role in preventing
    one container from being accessed, but they are essential to fend off some **Denial

    in a container without the root privileges. However, this separation is not as
    strong as that of virtual machines, which run independent OS instances on top
    of a hypervisor without sharing the kernel with the underlying OS. It's not a
    good idea to run applications with different security profiles as containers on
    the same host, but there are security benefits to encapsulate different applications
    into containerized applications that would otherwise run directly on the same
    host.

    to faulty code or due to the environmental changes between the development, testing,
    and deployment systems. Docker container technology eliminates the environmental
    issues between development, testing, and deployment as much as possible by containerizing
    all the application dependencies. Nonetheless, there could be still anomalies
    due to faulty code or variations in the kernel behavior, which needs debugging.

    technology, such as LXC and now Libcontainer. Libcontainer is Docker's own implementation
    in the Go programming language to access the kernel namespace and cgroups. This
    namespace is used for process-level isolation, while cgroups are used for restricting
    the resource usage of running containers. Since the containers run as independent
    processes directly over the Linux kernel, the **Generally Available** (**GA**)
    debugging tools are not fit enough to work inside the containers to debug the
    containerized processes. Docker now provides you with a rich set of tools to effectively
    debug the container as well as processes inside the container itself. The `docker
    exec` command will allow you to log in to the container without running an SSH
    daemon in the container. You have seen the details of each debugging tool in this
