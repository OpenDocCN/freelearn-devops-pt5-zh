<p class="mce-root">Developers are faced with ever-increasing pressure to build, modify, test, and deploy highly distributed applications in a high cadence. Operations engineers are looking for a uniform deployment strategy that encompasses most or all of their ever-growing portfolio of applications, and stakeholders want to keep their total cost of ownership low. Docker containers combined with a container orchestrator such as Kubernetes help them all to achieve these goals.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Docker containers accelerate and simplify the building, shipping, and running of highly distributed applications. Containers turbo-charge CI/CD pipelines, and containerized applications allow a company to standardize on one common deployment platform, such as Kubernetes. Containerized applications are more secure and can be run on any platform that's able to run containers, on premises or in the cloud.</p>

<p><a href="d9bb597d-2b32-4144-b068-564d85bcdf68.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Mastering Containers</em>, explains how to start, stop, and remove containers. We will also see how to inspect containers to retrieve additional metadata from them. Furthermore, we'll see how to run additional processes, how to attach to the main process in an already running container, and how to retrieve logging information from a container that is produced by the processes running inside it. Finally, the chapter introduces the inner workings of a container, including such things as Linux namespaces and groups.</p>
<p><a href="527543ae-a569-47dc-975d-65c96d0f6ff0.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Creating and Managing Container Images</em>, presents the different ways to create the container images that serve as the templates for containers. It introduces the inner structure of an image and how it is built. This chapter also explains how to lift and shift an existing legacy application so that it can run in containers.</p>
<p><a href="f3a48b12-d541-467b-aeb3-df014e60da6b.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Data Volumes and Configuration</em>, introduces data volumes, which can be used by stateful components running in containers. The chapter also shows how we can define individual environment variables for the application running inside the container, as well as how to use files containing whole sets of configuration settings.</p>
<p><a href="b6647803-2c5c-4b9d-9a4a-a836ac356329.xhtml" target="_blank"/><a href="b6647803-2c5c-4b9d-9a4a-a836ac356329.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Debugging Code Running in Containers</em>, discusses techniques commonly used to allow a developer to evolve, modify, debug, and test their code while running in a container. With these techniques at hand, the developer will enjoy a frictionless development process for applications running in a container, similar to what they experience when developing applications that run natively.</p>
<p><a href="b8ba79e9-1e6c-4b91-965d-d6b62b94437b.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Using Docker to Supercharge Automation</em>, shows how we can use tools to perform administrative tasks without having to install those tools on the host computer. We will also see how to use containers that host and run test scripts or code used to test and validate application services running in containers. Finally, this chapter guides us through the task of building a simple Docker-based CI/CD pipeline.</p>

This chapter introduces the concept of software-defined networks and explains how they are used to secure containerized applications. It also discusses how container ports can be opened to the public and thus make containerized components accessible from the outside world. Finally, it introduces Traefik, a reverse proxy, to enable sophisticated HTTP application-level routing between containers.</p>
<p><a href="412c6f55-a00b-447f-b22a-47b305453507.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Docker Compose</em>, addresses the concept of an application consisting of multiple services, each running in a container, and how Docker Compose allows us to easily build, run, and scale such an application using a declarative approach.</p>
<p><a href="27c0d9ce-fab6-4ce9-9034-4f2fb62931e8.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 12</a>, <em>Orchestrators</em>, presents the concept of orchestrators.

We will see all the concepts and objects SwarmKit uses to deploy and run a distributed, resilient, robust, and highly available application in a cluster on premises or in the cloud. The chapter also introduces how SwarmKit ensures secure applications using software-defined networks to isolate containers and secrets to protect sensitive information. Additionally, this chapter shows how to install a highly available Docker swarm in the cloud. It introduces the routing mesh, which provides Layer 4 routing and load balancing. Finally, it shows how to deploy an application consisting of multiple services onto the swarm.</p>
<p><a href="38cc9953-ef48-431b-97d5-f49f3e0415b0.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 14</a>,  <em>Zero-Downtime Deployments and Secrets</em>, explains how to deploy services or applications onto a Docker swarm with zero downtime and automatic rollback capabilities.
