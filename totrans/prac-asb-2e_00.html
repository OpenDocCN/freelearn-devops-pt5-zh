<p>Welcome to <em class="italic">Practical Ansible – Second Edition</em>, your guide to going from being a beginner to a proficient Ansible automation engineer in the space of a few chapters. This book will provide you with the knowledge and skills required to perform your very first installation and automation tasks with Ansible and take you on a journey from simple one-line automation commands that perform single tasks all the way through to writing your own complex custom code to extend the functionality of Ansible, and even automate cloud and container infrastructures. Throughout the book, practical examples will be given for you to not just read about Ansible automation but also actually try it out for yourself and understand how the code works. You will then be well placed to automate your infrastructure with Ansible in a manner that is scalable, repeatable, and reliable.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is for anyone who has IT tasks they want to automate, from mundane day-to-day housekeeping tasks to complex infrastructure-as-code-based deployments. It is intended to appeal to anyone with prior experience with Linux-based environments who wants to get up to speed quickly with Ansible automation and to a wide range of individuals, whether system administrators, DevOps engineers, or architects looking at overall automation strategy. It will even serve hobbyists well. Basic proficiency in Linux system administration and maintenance tasks is assumed; however, no previous Ansible or automation experience is required.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
<p>All the chapters of this book assume you have access to at least one Linux machine running a relatively recent Linux distribution. All examples in this book were tested on Fedora 38 and Ubuntu Server 22.04, but should work on just about any other mainstream distribution. You will require Ansible 2.15 installed on at least one test machine too – the installation steps will be covered in the very first chapter. Later versions of Ansible should also work, though there may be some subtle differences, and you should refer to the release notes and porting guide for newer Ansible versions. The final two chapters also take you through the installation of AWX, but this assumes a Linux server with Ansible installed. Most of the examples demonstrate automation across more than one host, and, if you have more Linux hosts available, you will be able to get more out of the examples; however, they can be scaled up or down as you require. Having more hosts is not mandatory, but enables you to get more out of the book.</p>

<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
  tasks:
  - name: Install/Update to the latest of Apache Web Server
    ansible.builtin.apt:
      name: apache2
      state: latest</pre> <p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
  handlers:
  - name: Restart the Apache Web Server
    ansible.builtin.service:
      name: <strong class="bold">apache2</strong>

<pre class="console">
$ python3 --version
Python 3.10.6</pre> <p><strong class="bold">Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or words that you see onscreen.

<p>In this section, we will take a look at the very fundamentals of Ansible. We will start with the process of installing Ansible and then we will get to grips with the fundamentals, including the basics of the language and ad-hoc commands. We will then explore Ansible inventories, before looking at writing our very first playbooks and roles to complete multi-stage automation tasks.</p>
