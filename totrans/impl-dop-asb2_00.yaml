- en: Ansible has taken the DevOps world by storm. Its highly scalable architecture
    and modular implementation have made it an ideal tool for implementing DevOps
    solutions at organizations large and small. Implementing DevOps with Ansible 2
    will provide detailed tutorials and information on how to implement DevOps solutions
    at your organization.Implementing DevOps with Ansible 2 aims to help encourage
    good software development and delivery practices within organizations by educating
    you on both the practical technology side of DevOps implementations as well as
    the cultural and collaborative implementations.Throughout the course of this book,
    we walk through many examples and solutions for common DevOps implementation shortcomings
    and automation requirements. The book walks you step by step through the implementation
    of solutions using examples that are easy to read and follow and simple to understand.As
    the author of Implementing DevOps with Ansible 2, it is my sincerest hope that
    this book helps you in your quest to become more DevOps and Ansible proficient.
    As such, I have set up a website to help readers further their knowledge and reach
    out to me for any questions. The URL is [http://www.ansibledevops.com](http://www.ansibledevops.com).
