The key concepts of <strong>JIRA Agile</strong> that will be covered are creating, planning, and managing the tasks. We will discuss how to set up and configure the board. Most importantly, we will discuss how to analyze reports. Scrum masters and Project managers will give you insight on how to use JIRA Agile, which will enable you to manage work following the Agile concept. Real-life examples will be used to understand Scrum and Kanban boards.</p><p>The topics covered are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Product overview—JIRA Software</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Scrum boards</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Kanban boards</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Managing multiple teams and projects using boards</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec71"/>Product overview – JIRA Software</h1></div></div></div><p>So far, we have seen various aspects of JIRA, such as customization, and we have also seen how to install new add-ons to extend the functionality of JIRA. Many organizations use Agile-based methodologies for their projects, and until version 6.x there was a popular add-on called JIRA Agile that had to be purchased separately. However, starting from version 7.x, the JIRA as it used to be known had been split into three applications—JIRA Core, JIRA Software, and JIRA Service Desk. We also discussed this in <a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Planning Your JIRA Installation">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Planning Your JIRA Installation</em>.</p><p>The customizations and configurations that we have discussed in this book are relevant to JIRA Core as well as JIRA Software and JIRA Service Desk. In <a class="link" href="ch15.html" title="Chapter 15. Implementing JIRA Service Desk">Chapter 15</a>, <em>Implementing JIRA Service Desk</em>, we will understand how to use it for managing your support projects, but in this chapter we will focus on Agile boards, which comes with your JIRA Software application.</p><p>JIRA Software provides great features for implementing Agile techniques in your JIRA instance. Whether you are already familiar with Agile concepts or are completely new to Agile, this add-on will make your Agile journey not only easy, but also wonderful.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec94"/>Installing the JIRA Software application</h2></div></div></div><p>If you already have the JIRA Software application installed, then you don't need to do anything else— your instance already has the capability to create Agile boards. However, if you are only using JIRA Core or the JIRA Service Desk application, then you need to install JIRA Software application.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to the following URL and download the latest version of JIRA Software <code class="literal">jira-software-application.obr</code> file on your computer from <a class="ulink" href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.jira-software-application/versions">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.jira.jira-software-application/versions</a>.</li><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Applications</strong> | <strong>Versions &amp; licenses</strong>, then click on the <strong>Upload an application</strong> link in the top right corner.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec72"/>Scrum boards</h1></div></div></div><p>Scrum is an Agile technique used in complex projects. This technique is widely used in software development projects, but it can be applied to any process easily. To know more about the Scrum technique, refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum">https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum</a>.</p><p>The Scrum technique focuses on breaking up the requirements into small doable tasks. Then, a prioritized list of these tasks is created (called a <strong>sprint</strong>), which can be performed in a period of one to four weeks. The objective of this sprint is to create a deliverable feature or product and not just a prototype. More sprints can be created to complete the whole requirement and finish the product or project. The tasks that are yet to be done are kept in a list called a <strong>backlog</strong>.</p><p>JIRA Agile lets you implement the Scrum technique in your process with the help of Scrum boards.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec95"/>Agile project setup and JIRA Agile configuration basics</h2></div></div></div><p>Scrum boards can be created from any existing JIRA project that contains predefined issues. It's possible to create a Scrum board from a new blank project as well. Also, if you want to understand how JIRA Agile works, it's possible to create a sample project prepopulated with sample data. Perform these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the navigation menu, click on <strong>Boards</strong> | <strong>View All Boards</strong> | <strong>Create board</strong>, and in the <strong>Create an Agile board</strong> pop-up, click on the <strong>Create a Scrum board with sample data</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_004.jpg" alt="Agile project setup and JIRA Agile configuration basics"/></div><p>
</p><p>We are creating a sample project that will contain dummy data. This will help us understand all the features of a Scrum board.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_005.jpg" alt="Agile project setup and JIRA Agile configuration basics"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Enter the <strong>Project name</strong>, <strong>Project key</strong>, and <strong>Project lead</strong> and click on the <strong>Create board</strong> button.</li></ol></div><p>We have just created a project with sample data along with a Scrum board. You can also create a Scrum board and select your existing project to populate it.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec96"/>Populating, ranking, and estimating a backlog using story points</h2></div></div></div><p>In the newly created project we have a Scrum board, which is displayed by default, so you will now see the list of issues that are pending, that is, not yet resolved in the <strong>Backlog</strong> window, and a sample sprint:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_006.jpg" alt="Populating, ranking, and estimating a backlog using story points"/></div><p>
</p><p>
<strong>Backlog</strong> contains issues that are pending in the project or board. These issues are yet to be planned for execution. In the project sidebar, the first tab is <strong>Backlog</strong>, followed by <strong>Active sprints</strong>. As soon as the sprint has started, you manage and work on it using the <strong>Active sprints</strong> tab.</p><p>The sample Scrum board already contains a sprint that has certain issues in a specific order. Sprint is a time period during which specific planned activities need to be finished. The Scrum master or the project manager can define the order in which issues need to be completed. This order is also known as <strong>rank</strong>, and the team who is working on these issues needs to follow this order. The rank is important because there are certain tasks that need to be completed before other tasks can be started.</p><p>In a Scrum methodology, the estimation of individual tasks is not only done on the basis of the amount of time spent, but also on the complexity of the tasks. For instance, there are two tasks whose time estimate is one day, but the first task is complex to execute, for example if it is the first time that the task has been executed by the team. The complexity is measured by story points. The story point can be any number between 1 to 10 or any number in the Fibonacci sequence, that is, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21. The higher the number, the more complex the task.</p><p>A Scrum master can assign story points to the issues in the sprint, although it's not mandatory to have story points with each issue in the sprint. However, having them will give the team an idea about the complexity of the issue.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec97"/>Planning and creating sprints</h2></div></div></div><p>The sample Scrum board already contains one running sprint; let's create a new sprint. JIRA Software allows you to create another sprint even if the active sprint is not complete; however, the new sprint cannot be started. It is possible to enable the <strong>Parallel Sprints</strong> feature in JIRA Agile that lets us run multiple sprints together.</p><p>The planning of the sprint has to be done in the <strong>Plan</strong> mode of the Scrum board. Perform these steps to run multiple sprints together:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Applications</strong> | <strong>JIRA Software configurations</strong> (under <strong>JIRA SOFTWARE</strong>):<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_007.jpg" alt="Planning and creating sprints"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Tick the checkbox for <strong>Parallel Sprints</strong>.<p>That is it, just go back to your board and start planning your next sprint.</p></li><li class="listitem">Go back to the project, and in the <strong>Backlog</strong> tab click on the <strong>Create Sprint</strong> button just before the issue backlog:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_008.jpg" alt="Planning and creating sprints"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">An empty sprint will be created.</li><li class="listitem">Now, start dragging your issues from <strong>Backlog</strong> to your sample sprint (in our case <strong>Sample Sprint 3</strong>):<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_009.jpg" alt="Planning and creating sprints"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Once you have put all your issues in the sprint, you may reorder them within the sprint and define their rank, that is, which issue needs to be performed first, second, and so on.</li><li class="listitem">Optionally, you can also create epics to group multiple stories together. Epic is nothing but a large story. It's quite easy to create an epic. Click on the <strong>Create epic</strong> link on the left-hand side of the sprint:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_010.jpg" alt="Planning and creating sprints"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the pop-up window, enter <strong>Epic Name</strong> and <strong>Summary</strong>. Click on the <strong>Create</strong> button to continue:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_011.jpg" alt="Planning and creating sprints"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">You can create more epics; finally, drag issues from your sprint to the epic. This will assign issues to be part of these epics:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_012.jpg" alt="Planning and creating sprints"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">After assigning issues to epic, you can start the sprint. Click on the <strong>Start Sprint</strong> link in the top-right corner. In the pop-up window, enter <strong>Sprint Name</strong>, select <strong>Duration</strong> and <strong>Start Date</strong>, and <strong>End Date </strong>will be updated automatically:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_013.jpg" alt="Planning and creating sprints"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Note that a sprint is never started until you have planned your issues well, ordered them, and estimated the story points. The moment you start the sprint, you will be taken to the <strong>Active sprints</strong> tab in the Scrum board. Here, you will see a list of all the issues in your sprints across three columns, that is, <strong>To Do</strong>, <strong>In Progress</strong>, <strong>Done</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_014.jpg" alt="Planning and creating sprints"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Active sprints</strong> tabs, the individual assignee can drag the issue to either the <strong>In Progress</strong> column or the <strong>Done</strong> column. This is similar to making workflow transitions.</p><p>There are a lot of customizations that can be done in the <strong>Active sprints</strong> to make it more effective.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec98"/>Configuring swimlanes, card colors, edit card fields, and quick filters</h2></div></div></div><p>
<strong>Active sprints</strong> is the section in the board that is monitored by the team members once the sprint is running. When the number of people working on the sprint is too high, it may get difficult for them to find the issues they are working on. Let's take a look at some of the customizations done to the Scrum board.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl3sec36"/>Swimlanes</h3></div></div></div><p>The issues that appear in the <strong>Work</strong> mode can be grouped together so that it becomes easy for the respective member to find that issue on the board. Also, when the issues are dragged from one column to another, they can only be dragged within their group, which is known as a swimlane. The default swimlane is the <strong>Story</strong> issue type. Let's change this:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Board</strong> | <strong>Configure</strong> | <strong>Swimlanes</strong> (under <strong>CONFIGURATION</strong>):<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_015.jpg" alt="Swimlanes"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Select <strong>Assignees</strong> for <strong>Base Swimlanes on</strong> from the drop-down list and set <strong>Unassigned issues</strong> as <strong>Show below other swimlanes</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_016.jpg" alt="Swimlanes"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>The swimlane can also be based on epics, and it's possible to have no swimlane at all.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl3sec37"/>Card colors</h3></div></div></div><p>The individual issues that appear in the <strong>Active sprints</strong> are displayed in a rectangular block called a card. The color of these cards can be changed based on its <strong>Issue Types</strong>, <strong>Priorities</strong>, <strong>Assignees</strong>, or <strong>Queries</strong>. The default option for the card color is the issue type; let's change it to issue priorities:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Board</strong> | <strong>Configure</strong> | <strong>Card colors</strong> (under <strong>CONFIGURATION</strong>).</li><li class="listitem">Select <strong>Priorities</strong> from the drop-down list for <strong>Colors based on</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_017.jpg" alt="Card colors"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Click on the color box to change the color to the color of your choice.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl3sec38"/>Card fields</h3></div></div></div><p>The card in the <strong>Backlog</strong> and <strong>Active sprints</strong> displays the <strong>Issue Id</strong> and <strong>Issue Summary</strong>, but it's possible to add up to three additional fields. Perform these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Board</strong> | <strong>Configure</strong> | <strong>Card layout</strong> (under <strong>CONFIGURATION</strong>).</li><li class="listitem">The additional three fields can be added for the <strong>Backlog</strong> and the <strong>Active sprints</strong>. We will add one additional field in the <strong>Active sprints</strong>. From the <strong>Field Name</strong> drop-down list, select <strong>Priority</strong> and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button on the right-hand side.<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_018.jpg" alt="Card fields"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>In total, you can add three additional fields that can appear on the card. This provision is provided so that fields that provide additional information can be made visible for the whole team to view.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl3sec39"/>Quick filters</h3></div></div></div><p>We saw how you can customize swimlanes to group several issues. Imagine a situation where there are 20 issues in the Active sprints that are assigned to you in the currently active sprint, but there are certain issues that are of the highest priority. In such cases, it will be nice to be able to not only quickly filter out the issues that are assigned to you, but also the issues that are due today. Perform these steps to achieve this:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Board</strong> | <strong>Configure</strong> | <strong>Quick Filters</strong> (under <strong>CONFIGURATION</strong>).</li><li class="listitem">Enter the <strong>Name</strong> of the quick filter as <code class="literal">Highest Priority</code>. In the <strong>JQL</strong> column, enter <code class="literal">priority = Highest</code> as the query and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_019.jpg" alt="Quick filters"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>We have done some customizations in our board. Let's go back to the <strong>Active sprints</strong>.</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_020.jpg" alt="Quick filters"/></div><p>
</p><p>Now, you can see that a new quick filter has been added at the top called <strong>Highest Priority</strong>; click on this link and the board will only display issues whose priority is highest. Note that the swimlane is now based on the <strong>Assignee</strong> of the issue. The issue priority is now added to the card. Also, the color of the card is based on the priority of the issue.</p><p>These customizations help the team to work efficiently so that they don't need to spend a lot of time finding the relevant information.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec99"/>The Burndown chart and Velocity charts</h2></div></div></div><p>You have learned how to plan, estimate, and start the sprint, along with various configurations available to perform in the board. We have checked how the team can view their tasks in the sprint. Now, it's time to monitor the progress of the team. There are two reports that are of prime importance—one is the <strong>Burndown chart</strong>. This chart gives a clear picture of the current status of the sprint. The second is the <strong>Velocity chart</strong>. This chart helps in understanding the capacity of the team in terms of how much work it can handle. These two reports help the Scrum master in monitoring the progress of the project. Let's take a look at both these reports.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl3sec40"/>The Burndown chart</h3></div></div></div><p>While planning the sprint, we primarily did two important things. Firstly, we prioritized the order in which the issues need to be completed. Secondly, we estimated the story points for issues. These story points, which we initially planned, give workers an idea of the complexity of the task. Now, the moment the sprint starts, a baseline is formed between the start date and the end date. This baseline is displayed with a grey line in the chart and it depicts the ideal scenario for executing the issues from the start date of the sprint until the end date. When the issue is resolved, its story points are burned and the total remaining story points of the whole sprint decreases.</p><p>Navigate to project sidebar <strong>Reports</strong> | <strong>Burndown Chart </strong>(under <strong>Agile</strong>):</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_021.jpg" alt="The Burndown chart"/></div><p>
</p><p>When the team starts working on the issues, another line of red color starts following the baseline. Looking at this chart, the whole team can easily figure out if they are on track or off track. If the line for <strong>Remaining Values</strong> is progressing above the baseline <strong>Guideline</strong>, then it shows that the story points are being burned slowly. Eventually, all the issues in the sprint will not be completed.</p><p>Just after the Burndown chart, the details of the individual issues are displayed:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_022.jpg" alt="The Burndown chart"/></div><p>
</p><p>In this table, you can see how many issues there were at the beginning of the sprint. As the issues are resolved, their story points are deducted from the total story points of the sprint. The total story points and the remaining story points will be displayed to the user.</p><p>Let's take a look at the Burndown chart again and focus towards the end:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_023.jpg" alt="The Burndown chart"/></div><p>
</p><p>It's clear by looking at this Burndown chart that by the end of the sprint, not all story points were burned; these unfinished issues will be added back to the backlog when the sprint is completed.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl3sec41"/>The Velocity chart</h3></div></div></div><p>Every sprint has a total number of story points at the beginning. Ideally, the team working on the sprint should burn all these points. In real cases, it's not always possible to complete all the tasks by the end of the sprint. One of the main responsibilities of the Scrum master is to make sure that the team have just enough story points to burn, not too many and not too few. However, at the beginning of the sprint, it's not that easy to estimate the amount of story points a team can burn. The velocity chart simply displays the amount of story points planned versus the amount actually completed by the team. This comparison is shown for the past few sprints so that the average number of story points that the team can burn can be calculated. This is known as the capacity of the team.</p><p>Navigate to the project sidebar <strong>Reports</strong> | <strong>Velocity </strong>(under <strong>Agile</strong>):</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_024.jpg" alt="The Velocity chart"/></div><p>
</p><p>This chart gives us a very clear indication of the story points that the team has been able to complete in previous sprints. If you take the average of all the story points that your team has been able to burn until now, you will know your capacity. This helps the Scrum master to plan the next sprint with enough resources in the team.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec73"/>Kanban boards</h1></div></div></div><p>We have discussed the Scrum methodology, widely used for software development projects where requirements are broken down into smaller tasks, estimated using story points, and finally planned by the Scrum master or product manager. The Scrum technique is applicable in any process that requires planning, but there are various cases where the team is continuously working on activities as and when required. A typical example of this use case is customer support projects, where a certain number of people are assigned to handle the issues that are raised for a particular product or project by the company. Usually, these support issues require immediate response and detailed planning is not required.</p><p>In such scenarios, the overall visualization of the pending issues is important. A Kanban board doesn't have any <strong>Plan</strong> mode like the Scrum board. It only has the <strong>Work</strong> mode, which is similar to the Scrum board.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec100"/>Setting up the Kanban board</h2></div></div></div><p>A Kanban board can be created using existing projects or filters. To understand how the Kanban technique works in JIRA, a sample board and project can be created. Perform these steps to create them:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the navigation menu, click on <strong>Boards</strong> | <strong>View All Boards</strong> | <strong>Create board</strong>, and in the <strong>Create an Agile board</strong> pop-up, click on the <strong>Create a Kanban board with sample data</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_025.jpg" alt="Setting up the Kanban board"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Enter the <strong>Project name</strong>, <strong>Project key</strong>, <strong>Project lead</strong> and click on the <strong>Create board</strong> button.<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_026.jpg" alt="Setting up the Kanban board"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>As you will notice, the <strong>Active sprints</strong> tab is not present in the <strong>Kanban board</strong>. The team sees the <strong>Kanban board</strong> only. This board is quite similar to the Scrum board; you can also configure the swimlanes based on assignees; by default, the swimlanes in the Kanban board are configured to use the <code class="literal">priority = Highest</code> query. This means that issues that should be resolved immediately are displayed at the top.</p><p>The people who have these issues assigned can move the issue from one column to another. These columns signify the workflow states. Most of the configurations that we did for the Scrum board can be done on the Kanban board as well; let's perform some configurations that we did not check in the Scrum board.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl2sec101"/>Column constraints</h2></div></div></div><p>When a team works on support issues, it's important to resolve the issues as soon as possible. Usually, companies sign <strong>Service Level Agreement</strong> (<strong>SLA</strong>), that is, with their customers where they need to agree on the resolution time. In situations like these, the whole team should get the overall picture of the issues they need to work on. For instance, if there are fewer people available on the support issues, then there is a limitation on the number of issues these people can work on at a given point in time. In the sample Kanban board, you will notice that the <strong>In progress</strong> column is red whenever there is more than one issue in it.</p><p>Let's say you want to alert the team whenever there are more than four issues in the backlog:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Board</strong> | <strong>Configure</strong> | <strong>Columns</strong> (under <strong>CONFIGURATION</strong>).<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_027.jpg" alt="Column constraints"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In <strong>Column management</strong>, first select <strong>Column Constraint</strong> as <strong>Issue Count</strong>. As shown in the previous screenshot, enter the maximum number of issue counts in the <strong>Backlog</strong> section.</li><li class="listitem">Now, create one more issue in your sample project so that your backlog has more than four issues.</li><li class="listitem">Go back to your Kanban board and check the <strong>Backlog</strong> column:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_11_028.jpg" alt="Column constraints"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>The rest of the configuration is exactly the same as what we have done for Scrum. You can configure swimlanes, add quick filters, and also add a few additional fields in the card layout. The procedure of configuring these was already discussed in the Scrum section earlier, and it's the same for Kanban boards.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec74"/>Managing multiple teams and projects using boards</h1></div></div></div><p>The sample projects and boards that we created to understand Scrum and Kanban techniques used only one project, but JIRA Software boards can be configured to use multiple projects too.</p><p>If your team members are working on different projects for the same client, then it will make more sense to manage the work from a single board. Scrum and Kanban boards can be configured for issues that either come from one, two, or multiple projects. Perform these steps to manage the work from a single board:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">In the navigation menu, click on <strong>Boards</strong> | <strong>View All Boards</strong> | <strong>Create board,</strong> and in the <strong>Create an Agile board</strong> pop-up, click on the <strong>Create a Scrum board</strong> button or <strong>Create a Kanban board</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">In the pop-up window, you can either create a new project with a new board or also create a board from a filter, but we can select the second option, that is, <strong>Board from an existing project</strong> and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button:<p>

</p></li><li class="listitem">Your newly created board will now have issues from all the projects that you have selected.</li></ol></div><p>The issues from multiple projects can now be added for the sprint in the Scrum board or will appear in the Kanban backlog and your team can work on them.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch11lvl1sec75"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you learned how to implement Scrum and Kanban Agile methodologies using the Software application.
