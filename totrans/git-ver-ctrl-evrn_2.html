<em>In the previous chapter we got enlightened on how a version control system can change the way we face everyday situations when it comes to digitized files, followed by the evolution of version control systems.</em>
</p><p>
<em>We also understood why Git is considered the best in class and how it can serve our purposes.</em>
</p><p>In this chapter we will get to know how you can install and configure Git. We shall cover the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Choosing the Git type that suits your environment</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing Git</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec15"/>Choosing your type – download your OS specific package</h1></div></div></div><p>Like many other tools, Git <a id="id42" class="indexterm"/> can be downloaded from the Internet and the best part is it's free, thanks to the open source community. Git can be installed on a variety of operating systems such as Mac OS X, Windows, Linux, and Solaris. We will consider the top three operating systems in terms of user base in discussing our concepts:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Windows</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Linux</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Mac OS X</li></ul></div><p>To start, you need to download your operating system specific Git package; we can get the list of downloadable packages <a id="id43" class="indexterm"/> from <a class="ulink" href="http://git-scm.com/downloads">http://git-scm.com/downloads</a>. Go ahead and download the latest stable release relevant to your OS, which you can find on the website, as shown in the following screenshot (Version 1.8.0.2 was the latest stable release at the time of writing this chapter):</p><div><img src="img/7522_02_01.jpg" alt="Choosing your type – download your OS specific package"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note02"/>Note</h3><p>For those of you Linux and Mac users who enjoy using a <strong>command-line interface</strong> (<strong>CLI</strong>) <a id="id44" class="indexterm"/> mode to get things done, there's no need to go through the following procedures of downloading and installing via GUI. You can use your OS specific installer to get things done. For example, if you are using a Debian based Linux OS, <code class="literal">apt-get install git-core</code> <a id="id45" class="indexterm"/> is enough for installing Git on your system, whereas if you are using a Mac you can either use Apple's Xcode IDE, <a id="id46" class="indexterm"/> which is an Apple approved method to install things, or Macports <a id="id47" class="indexterm"/> or Fink <a id="id48" class="indexterm"/> to install Git for you.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec15"/>Windows</h2></div></div></div><p>If you are trying to <a id="id49" class="indexterm"/> download from a Windows machine, the website detects that and automatically provides the <strong>Download for Windows</strong> button. Upon clicking that, you will be prompted to save the setup file. Choose your preferred location to save the file and you are good to go.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec16"/>Linux</h2></div></div></div><p>There are always multiple ways of doing things in Unix operating systems. We will take the easiest possible route which everybody can follow. So unless you are a person who loves installing packages through compiling, there is no need for downloading them from this website. You can move to <a id="id50" class="indexterm"/> the <em>Installation</em> section directly from here.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note03"/>Note</h3><p>For people who want to install Git by getting the source code and compiling it, perform the following steps:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Click on the <strong>Git source repository</strong> link; you will be taken to a page that lists the contents of the source code package. Click on the button called <strong>Zip</strong>, which will prompt you with the file download. Save it in your preferred location.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">You can then go through the regular <code class="literal">unzip, configure</code>, <code class="literal">make</code>, and <code class="literal">make install</code> commands, which we won't discuss here.</li></ul></div></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec17"/>Mac</h2></div></div></div><p>If you are trying to download from a Mac machine, the website detects that and automatically provides the <strong>Download for Mac</strong> button. Upon clicking that, you will be prompted to save the setup file. Choose your preferred location to save the file and you are good to go.</p><p>The download file usually follows a naming convention like Git-latest.stable_release_version_here-min-required-os-info.dmg, for example, <strong>git-1.8.0.2-3-intel-universal-snow-leopard.dmg</strong>.</p><p>You can use the same 1.8.0.2 installer for any version of Mac OS on or above Snow Leopard. For Leopard users there are lower versions of Git available, which you can get from <a class="ulink" href="http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list">http://code.google.com/p/git-osx-installer/downloads/list</a>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec18"/>Installation</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that you have got your <a id="id51" class="indexterm"/> own copy of Git, let's proceed to the installation phase. Let's go over the installation process for different operating systems one at a time.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note04"/>Note</h3><p>As with any other installation, you need administrative rights to install this software.</p></div></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec16"/>Time for action – installing Git on Windows</h1></div></div></div><p>Perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Double-click <a id="id52" class="indexterm"/> on the <a id="id53" class="indexterm"/> downloaded <a id="id54" class="indexterm"/> setup file to get started with the installation.</li><li class="listitem">The first and second steps of the installation process are self-explanatory. It first greets you with a welcome message and informs you about the "safe to follow" procedures before installation, that is, to close all other opened applications before continuing (just to avoid the remote chance of any shared dll/exe being overridden or a simple case of your system running out of memory, which is required in large amounts whenever you perform an installation). Then it shows you the details about the GNU public license Version 2 by which our Git is governed.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note05"/>Note</h3><p>To get to know more about what you can and cannot do with the software package, go ahead and read it.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">Clicking on the <strong>Next</strong> button on the screen brings us to the following screen, which gets your preferred location for the installation:<div><img src="img/7522_02_02.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Windows"/></div><p>The <a id="id55" class="indexterm"/> default location is inside the <strong>Program Files</strong> directory <a id="id56" class="indexterm"/> of your Windows installation. If you <a id="id57" class="indexterm"/> group all custom software installations in a separate partition to safeguard your data in case of an OS crash, you can go ahead and select your preferred path by clicking on the <strong>Browse…</strong> button.</p></li><li class="listitem">After clicking on <strong>Next</strong> you will be facing a component configuration screen in which you need to select <strong>Git Bash Here</strong> and <strong>Git GUI Here</strong> options under the <strong>Context menu entries</strong> section, as shown in the following screenshot:<div><img src="img/7522_02_03.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Windows"/></div><p>These <a id="id58" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id59" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id60" class="indexterm"/> options are going to provide us quick access to interfaces that we can use to command Git. We will see more about them in the oncoming chapters.</p></li><li class="listitem">Next we are prompted to select a group name under which shortcuts are placed in the start menu for easy and quick access. Let us leave it to the default value <code class="literal">Git</code> and click on <strong>Next</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">This brings us to the following screen, in which we select the second option, which says <strong>Run Git from the Windows Command Prompt</strong>:<div><img src="img/7522_02_04.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Windows"/></div><p>This <a id="id61" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id62" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id63" class="indexterm"/> setting is basically for people who will be using command lines to control Git and its activities. This option is going to allow us to command Git additionally from the native Windows command-line interface DOS.</p><p>After making the selection, click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p></li><li class="listitem">The remaining two main steps are configurations that we will need while working remotely and/or collaboratively across operating systems.<p>If and only if you have any SSH sessions in your registry will the installation file detect that and prompt you with the following screen:</p><div><img src="img/7522_02_05.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Windows"/></div><p>If you are a <a id="id64" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id65" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id66" class="indexterm"/> user to whom the very term SSH is new but happen to have SSH sessions in your system through other means, or an experienced user who wants to switch to <a id="id67" class="indexterm"/> OpenSSH, go ahead and select the <strong>Use OpenSSH</strong> option.</p><p>If you are comfortable using other SSH applications to connect to remote systems, select the <strong>Use (Tortoise)Plink</strong> option. Make a selection on the <strong>Choosing the SSH executable</strong> screen<strong> </strong>and click on <strong>Next</strong>.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note06"/>Note</h3><p>OpenSSH keys <a id="id68" class="indexterm"/> are created with ssh-keygen <a id="id69" class="indexterm"/> and cached with <a id="id70" class="indexterm"/> ssh-agent. With the putty suite, keys are created with the graphical program puttygen <a id="id71" class="indexterm"/> and loaded/cached with <a id="id72" class="indexterm"/> pageant, and SSH is done using <a id="id73" class="indexterm"/> putty.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">Anybody who has worked with files across different types of operating systems will definitely know about the problem with different styles of line endings. </li><li class="listitem">Now you need to tell <a id="id74" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id75" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id76" class="indexterm"/> Git how it has to treat those line endings. In the following screen select <strong>Checkout Windows-style, commit Unix-style line endings</strong> so as to ensure that there is no clash between <strong>carriage return line feed</strong> (<strong>CRLF</strong>) <a id="id77" class="indexterm"/> and <a id="id78" class="indexterm"/> <strong>line feed</strong> (<strong>LF</strong>) when working across platforms:<div><img src="img/7522_02_06.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Windows"/></div></li></ol></div><p>That's about it. Your installer should finish the installation now.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec19"/>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18"/>Time for action – installing Git on Linux</h1></div></div></div><p>As we <a id="id96" class="indexterm"/> discussed <a id="id97" class="indexterm"/> earlier, we are going to perform a Git installation on a Linux operating system with the help of your <a id="id98" class="indexterm"/> distribution's inbuilt <a id="id99" class="indexterm"/> 
<strong>graphical software management system</strong>. In this tutorial I have used a distribution called Ubuntu, which is based (downstream) on the famous Debian operating system.</p><p>In here the software management system is called <a id="id100" class="indexterm"/> synaptic. Perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Open up the <strong>run utility</strong> <a id="id101" class="indexterm"/> prompt by pressing <em>Alt</em> + <em>F2</em> and type <code class="literal">synaptic</code>.<div><img src="img/7522_02_11.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Linux"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Matching tools <a id="id102" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id103" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id104" class="indexterm"/> automatically get displayed below; let's click on the first one, which says <strong>synaptic-pkexec</strong>. This pops up an authentication dialog box, since the installation requires elevated privileges, as stated earlier. So give it your password that has administrative access and click on <strong>Authenticate</strong>.<div><img src="img/7522_02_12.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Linux"/></div></li><li class="listitem">This should <a id="id105" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id106" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id107" class="indexterm"/> open up the <strong>Synaptic Package Manager</strong> window, which shows you the available packages on the centre pane and available repository sources on the left. Let's type the name of the package that we want to install now which is <code class="literal">git</code> in the <strong>Quick filter</strong> text box. It automatically populates the matching packages on the content pane below it.<div><img src="img/7522_02_13.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Linux"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now we can <a id="id108" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id109" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id110" class="indexterm"/> see a package named <strong>git</strong> whose version, which is shipped by default, is <strong>1.7.5.4</strong> (don't worry about the version mismatch; the concepts we are going to learn henceforth are the same for all) and its description says <strong>fast, scalable, distributed revision control system</strong>. This is the package that we want to install, so let's right-click on it and select <strong>Mark for Installation</strong>.<div><img src="img/7522_02_14.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Linux"/></div></li><li class="listitem">Now the checkbox next to the package name will have a tick option indicating that you <a id="id111" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id112" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id113" class="indexterm"/> have selected that particular package for installation. To handle things much more easily we are going to need two more packages associated with Git, namely <strong>Git GUI</strong> <a id="id114" class="indexterm"/> and <a id="id115" class="indexterm"/> <strong>Gitk.</strong> So<strong> </strong>let's right-click on the same package again and select the option <strong>Mark Suggested for Installation </strong>and select <strong>git-gui</strong> from it.<div><img src="img/7522_02_15.jpg" alt="Time for action – installing Git on Linux"/></div></li><li class="listitem">The package manager will prompt you, asking about the required package changes, that is, adding <strong>gitk </strong>to the installable list; so click on <strong>Mark</strong>. Now that you have marked your packages to be installed let's go ahead! Wait, we did not select the gitk package which we said we would need! Yes that's right, we didn't. But that will be automatically installed, as it is a dependent package. You will see that in the oncoming steps.</li><li class="listitem">Now go ahead and click on the green <strong>Apply</strong> button on the shortcut bar below the menu bar.
