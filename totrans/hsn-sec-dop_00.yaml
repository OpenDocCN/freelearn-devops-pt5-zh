- en: DevOps has provided speed and quality benefits with continuous development and
    deployment methods, but it does not guarantee the security of an entire organization.
    Hands-On Security in DevOps shows you how to adopt DevOps techniques to continuously
    improve your organization's security at every level, rather than just focusing
    on protecting your infrastructure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This guide combines DevOps and security to help you to protect cloud services,
    and teaches you how to use techniques to integrate security directly in your product.
    You will learn how to implement security at every layer, such as for the web application,
    cloud infrastructure, communication, and the delivery pipeline layers. With the
    help of practical examples, you'll explore the core security aspects, such as
    blocking attacks, fraud detection, cloud forensics, and incident response. In
    the concluding chapters, you will cover topics on extending DevOps security, such
    as risk assessment, threat modeling, and continuous security.

    all layers of your organization and be confident in monitoring and blocking attacks
    throughout your cloud services.

    assurance program and security practices in the DevOps process. Microsoft SDL
    and SAMM were introduced to apply to the security assurance program. In addition
    to the process, the non-technical parts, security training, and culture are also
    critical to the success of the security program. We will also give an example
    of how security tools and web security framework can help during the whole DevOps

    principles. For security architects and developers, building software on a mature
    security framework will greatly reduce not only security risks with industry best
    practices but also implementation efforts. Therefore, this chapter introduces

    most effective to identify certain specific security issues, such as XXE, deserialization,
    and SQL injection. However, a whitebox review can be time-consuming if there are
    no proper tools or strategies. To have an effective whitebox test, we need to
    focus on specific coding patterns and high-risk modules. This chapter will give

    secure code scanning, and suggested some static code analysis tools. For the build
    and package delivery, secure compiler configurations and dependency vulnerability
    checks will also be introduced. Finally, web security automation testing approaches

    mainly discuss the key activities in the key phases of the incident response process:
    preparation, containment, detection, and post-incident analysis. The field of
    incident response includes how to handle public CVE vulnerability, how to respond
    to white hat or security attacks, how we evaluate each security issue, the feedback
    loop to the development team, and the tools or practices we may apply in incident

    this chapter is to prepare our security monitoring mechanism to protect and prevent
    our cloud services from being attacked. To be prepared for this, our security
    monitoring procedures should include logging, monitoring the framework, threat
    intelligence, and security scanning for malicious programs.'

    in this chapter. Cloud services may have frequent releases and updates. It''s
    a challenge for the development, operations, and security teams to release their
    work within a short time frame and to finish the minimum required security testing
    before releases. In this chapter, we will look at the security review policies
    and the suggested checklist and testing tools for every release. For testing integration,

    services introduce new types of security risks, such as transaction fraud, account
    abuses, and promotion code abuses. This online fraud and abuse may result in financial
    losses or gains, depending on which side of the fence you sit. It will also provide
    guidelines and rules on how to detect these kinds of behaviors. We will discuss
    typical technical frameworks and technical approaches needed to build a service
