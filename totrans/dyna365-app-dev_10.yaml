    them with Dynamics 365\. Microsoft Cognitive Services is a collection of APIs,

- en: Microsoft Cognitive Services can be defined as a collection of APIs that can
    be easily configured and consumed to bring powerful artificial intelligence capabilities
    to applications, websites, and bots. Microsoft Cognitive Services are standard
    JSON-based REST APIs which can be consumed from a number of popular languages
    like Curl, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and so on. Early in 2015, Microsoft
    had released a set of technologies under Project Oxford that allowed developers
    to build more intelligent apps incorporating Machine Learning aspects, which was
    then later rebranded to Microsoft Cognitive Services. Currently, Microsoft Cognitive
    Services consists of different APIs such as Computer Vision API, Video API, Bing
    Speech API, Text Analytics API, Recommendations API, Bing Image Search API, and
    so on, categorized into Vision, Speech, Language, Knowledge and Speech.
