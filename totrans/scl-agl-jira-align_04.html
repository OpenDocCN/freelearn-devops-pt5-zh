		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-38"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Chapter 3</em>: Navigating Jira Align</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will master basic user interface navigation and core functionality to provide a solid foundation for making the most out of Jira Align. We will explore how Jira Align facilitates onboarding by enabling alignment and continuous learning. We will then learn how to create and refine a backlog. This involves creating, linking, importing and exporting, ranking, estimating, deleting, and searching for work items. Lastly, we will discuss team collaboration and keeping everyone informed through notifications and alerts in Jira Align.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Getting around Jira Align</li>
				<li>Facilitating onboarding</li>
				<li>Creating and refining backlogs</li>
				<li>Collaborating in Jira Align</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>Make sure you've done the quick setup that we covered in <a href="B16328_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Jira Align</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Getting around Jira Align</h1>
			<p>Jira Align is a web-based <a id="_idIndexMarker109"/>application accessed via a web browser. It is compatible with the latest version of most popular browsers, including Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari, and Microsoft Edge. You will sign in to Jira Align by navigating to your <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>Jira Align URL, <a href="https://ORGANIZATION-NAME.jiraalign.com">https://ORGANIZATION-NAME.jiraalign.com</a>, where <code>ORGANIZATION-NAME</code> is replaced by your organization's subdomain.</p>
			<p>Jira Align supports SSO integration, which can bypass the login page shown here and take you straight to the landing page. We have already covered this in <a href="B16328_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Jira Align</em>, where you learned how to set up SSO in Jira Align with your chosen SAML 2.0 supported<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> Identity Manager:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – Jira Align login page</p>
			<p>Once you sign in to the application, you will see the following home page:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.2_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Jira Align home page"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – Jira Align home page</p>
			<p>The following are three key areas to master<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> in Jira Align:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Navigation menu</strong>: This is located on the far left and expands when you click on a menu item. It allows you to navigate modules for displaying and editing work items at each level of scale.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Configuration bar</strong>: This is located at the top of each page and allows you to set the context configuration for filtering your work items based on people, time, and other dimensions, such as product and organization.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Workspace</strong>: This is located in the center and is the main hub for all information displayed in Jira Align. The information is based on the levels of scale you select from the navigation menu and the context filter you set in the configuration bar for the people, time, and other dimensions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let's explore each of these three key areas.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Navigation menu</h2>
			<p>The navigation <a id="_idIndexMarker113"/>menu is organized methodically to group modules at the corresponding levels of scale: enterprise, portfolio, solution, program, and team. For example, when you hover over the primary menu and select <strong class="bold">Program</strong>, it expands to display the associated modules grouped by meaningful categories, such as Program, Manage, Track, and Transform. As shown in the following screenshot, you can access the program backlog under <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Backlog</strong> and the feature grid under <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Features</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.3_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Jira Align program menu"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – Jira Align program menu</p>
			<p>If you can't remember where a module is located in the navigation menu, you can click on the search icon (magnifying glass) to find the module. You can access your frequently used modules by clicking on the star menu icon. To add a new favorite, click on the encircled plus sign to favorite the current page, as shown in the following screenshot. You can also see <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>recently accessed modules by clicking on <strong class="bold">Recents</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.4_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – Jira Align favorites"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – Jira Align favorites</p>
			<p>If you are unable to find a module, speak with your Jira Align administrator. Module access is controlled via Jira Align roles and your administrator can help to ensure that your role has access to the right modules. They will do this by simply toggling module access on or off under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Access Controls</strong> | <strong class="bold">Roles</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.5_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – Jira Align role permissions"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – Jira Align role permissions</p>
			<p>The role permissions<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> are organized into three levels:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Level 1</strong>: Controls access to navigation menu items corresponding to the levels of scale and additional verticals, such as administration, products, collaboration, and additional options. For example, you can choose to toggle off the solution menu if the solution level is not in use at your organization or if it does not apply to the selected user role.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Level 2</strong>: Controls access to the modules within each main level menu. You can toggle on or off modules in submenus, for example, the <strong class="bold">Roadmaps</strong> module appearing under <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> in <em class="italic">Figure 3.3 – Jira Align program menu</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Level 3</strong>: Controls the module-specific actions that are directly linked to permissions. You can grant a user permission to perform an action by toggling on or off the module-specific actions, such as save, create, or delete.<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p><p class="callout">We recommend starting with the default roles in Jira Align. The default roles include Super Admin, PMO, Executive, Product Owners, Team Leads, Team Member, Kanban Users, and External User.</p><p class="callout">If you need to create a new role, we recommend that you copy an existing role that maps closely to your intended new role. This will copy permissions from the existing role, which you can then adjust to meet the needs of the new Jira Align role.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that you've got the<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> right level of access for your role, let's review the reports that you have available. You can access the reports dashboard by clicking on the reports menu icon, which is second from the bottom in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.6_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – Jira Align reports dashboard"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – Jira Align reports dashboard</p>
			<p>Here you will see a list of report categories and a search box. These enable you to explore over 165 reports that will help you track and analyze work and outcomes at every level of scale. As with modules, access to reports is controlled via Jira Align roles, so speak with your administrator regarding any additional reports you may need.</p>
			<p>Now that you know how to find reports and modules, let's explore some user profile and preferences settings <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>that will optimize your experience. These can be found under the user menu:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.7_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7 – Jira Align user menu"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – Jira Align user menu</p>
			<p>To access this menu, click on the <strong class="bold">User Menu</strong> icon at the top of the navigation bar, just below the Jira Align icon. The first item we'll look at is where you can add your photo in order to put a more human face to your work and interactions with fellow coworkers. To do that, click on <strong class="bold">Edit Profile</strong> to display your user profile data, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.8_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8 – Jira Align edit profile"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8 – Jira Align edit profile</p>
			<p>If you haven't already <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>uploaded a photo or you wish to change your photo, you can do so by hovering over the area to the left of your name and clicking on the pencil icon. You can change your password by clicking on the button to the top right. In the area below, you can generate an API token, view personal time off, and see a complete summary of your work environment, including your connected user network, awards, skills, associated teams, and roles.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">If you want to make any changes to your account details, speak with your Jira Align administrator, who will be able to assist you. The user accounts are managed under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Access Controls</strong> | <strong class="bold">People</strong>. This topic has been covered in <a href="B16328_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Jira Align</em>, where you learned the details for creating and managing a user account.</p>
			<p>Now that your profile is complete, let's make a few recommended settings in your preferences. To do so, either click on the <strong class="bold">Update Preferences</strong> button shown in the previous edit profile screenshot, or click on the user menu icon, which is your photo at the top on the <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>navigation menu, and then on <strong class="bold">Edit Preferences</strong>, to bring up the following page:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.9_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9 – Jira Align edit preferences"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9 – Jira Align edit preferences</p>
			<p>The recommended settings, as shown in this screenshot, are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Records Displayed Per Screen</strong>: Set the records per screen to <strong class="bold">max 30</strong> to display more records in the workspace.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Show External IDs</strong>: Toggle on this option to show the Jira issue keys for work items that bi-directionally sync with Jira.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Zone</strong>: Set your time zone to ensure that the time is converted and displayed according to your local time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition to these recommended settings, you can toggle on or off daily summary and change tracking emails and the display of tips when filling out forms (helpful for new users). You can also specify whether you want to use sliders or a drop-down menu for scoring epics and capabilities on their <strong class="bold">Value</strong> tabs.</p>
			<p>Now that we've set preferences, let's see where to find Jira Align's application version, build details, and release notes. It's important to check the release notes in order to learn about the latest feature updates. Jira Align is improving continually, with releases every 2 weeks. Simply go to <strong class="bold">User Menu</strong> | <strong class="bold">About</strong> to access this information.</p>
			<p>There are a few more<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> important items under the user menu. Clicking on <strong class="bold">Help</strong> will direct you to the public knowledge base where you will find a wealth of Jira Align articles and FAQs. Clicking on <strong class="bold">Support</strong> will direct you to the Jira Align support channels, for example, if you think you've encountered a bug. Lastly, you can sign out of the application by clicking on <strong class="bold">Log Out</strong>, which will direct you back to the login page.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">For Jira Align administrators, if you want to reproduce a Jira Align module access or functionality issue, you can use the <strong class="bold">Impersonate</strong> administration feature in the user menu to log on as another user without having to enter a password to authenticate. This helps with quick troubleshooting and is typically available only to Jira Align administrators. However, we recommend making this feature available for Jira Align core team members to reduce the burden on the administrator(s).</p>
			<p>So far, we have seen how the navigation menu allows you to access work items at each level of scale. Now, let's see how to filter work items based on the people and time dimensions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Configuration bar</h2>
			<p>The configuration bar <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>allows you to configure the tool for your context, for what you want to see. For example, an agile program manager or <code>Mutants</code> portfolio and the <code>20Q3</code> and <code>20Q4</code> PI:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.10_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.10 – Jira Align configuration bar"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.10 – Jira Align configuration bar</p>
			<p>You can click on the plus icon to set additional configuration scope or use the gears icon to access and save advanced configuration filters. The configuration bar will retain your settings as you <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>navigate through Jira Align and for future logins until you change them.</p>
			<p>The parameters you can set and filter on in the configuration bar are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Portfolio structure</strong>: Sets the scope for the people dimension based on the level of scale, for example, portfolio, solution, program, and team.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Program increment</strong>: Sets the scope based on time; you can choose past, present, and future PI(s) or a specific date range, such as a year, a quarter, two quarters, or all time, as the scope.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Release vehicle</strong>: Sets the release version, another element based on time; you can choose a specific release or delivery milestone.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Product</strong>: Allows you to select products from the product tree; note that product is related to the work dimension, as features can be associated with products in Jira Align. Whether or not products are required for a given portfolio is set by the Jira Align administrator in <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio Specific Configuration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage Products</strong>. When set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, the <strong class="bold">Product</strong> field will be required.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organization structure</strong>: Sets the scope based on your organizational structures, such as business unit and line of business.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Advanced configuration</strong>: Allows you to set a granular scope based on additional filters, such as sprints, business driver, functional area, strategic snapshot, convention, defect suite, and tags.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you will need to frequently<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> use your custom configuration settings, you can simply click <strong class="bold">Save as New</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Advanced configuration</strong> filter to list it under <strong class="bold">SAVED CONFIGURATIONS</strong>. You can return at any time to select your saved configuration filter and then click on <strong class="bold">Apply</strong>. Next to your saved configuration, you also have the option to delete or rename the saved configuration. If you need to make any changes to an existing saved configuration, simply select it, make the changes, and click on <strong class="bold">Save Changes</strong>. Alternatively, you can click <strong class="bold">Apply Settings</strong> to test the added changes to your custom configuration filter:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.11_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11 – Jira Align advanced configuration"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11 – Jira Align advanced configuration</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">If you want to clear values<a id="_idIndexMarker124"/> from the configuration filter, instead of removing the values one by one and applying the change, you can use the <strong class="bold">Reset All</strong> option under <strong class="bold">Advanced configuration</strong> to clear all filters, or you can choose the <strong class="bold">Reset</strong> option to clear a specific configuration filter setting. For example, if you reset the <strong class="bold">Product filter</strong> setting, it would clear the product-specific filter selections and display all work items.</p>
			<p class="callout">We recommend resetting your configuration bar filter settings if you are experiencing issues with not being able to see work that is in the scope of your filter settings. To do so, click on the gears icon and then <strong class="bold">Reset All</strong>. This will clear any filters that could be set inadvertently, allowing all work items to be displayed.</p>
			<p>Now you know how to set the scope for the work, people, and time dimensions. Next, let's see where you would find the information displayed in Jira Align.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Workspace</h2>
			<p>The workspace displays <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>information based on your selected module from the navigation menu and your filters set in the configuration bar. You will typically see information arranged in grids, charts, and graphs. Note that in the lower right-hand corner of the workspace, there is a <strong class="bold">Help</strong> button. Clicking on this will open a panel on the right side of the workspace with contextual help based on what you are viewing in the workspace. For example, if you are viewing the feature backlog, the panel will display information explaining all the options and functionality available in the backlog, such as ranking.</p>
			<p>In the upper-right corner of the workspace, you will find a <strong class="bold">Columns Shown</strong> button. Clicking on this allows you to configure the columns shown in grid views. For example, the feature grid allows you to add up to 12 columns to be displayed. You can access the feature grid by clicking on the Program icon in the navigation menu and selecting <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Features</strong>. In the following screenshot, we have configured the columns on the feature grid to display the <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>developmental state, link to acceptance criteria, business driver, <strong class="bold">MMF</strong> (short for <strong class="bold">minimum marketable feature</strong>) indicator, release vehicle, and story points:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.12_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.12 – Jira Align feature grid"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.12 – Jira Align feature grid</p>
			<p>The first column shows<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> the features' Jira Align IDs, which you can click on to open the details panel for a given feature. The next column displays the features' Jira issue keys and is present as a result of the <strong class="bold">Show External IDs</strong> setting that we made previously under <strong class="bold">User Menu</strong> | <strong class="bold">Edit Preferences</strong>.</p>
			<p>While work item grids such as the feature grid may resemble a backlog, they are actually different. For example, the work item grid does not allow ranking. However, it does provide functionality not available in the backlog, which you can access by clicking on <strong class="bold">More Actions</strong> in the upper-right corner of the workspace. This will open a menu with additional actions, including mass move, import, and export, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.13_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.13 – Jira Align more actions menu"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.13 – Jira Align more actions menu</p>
			<p>We will explore the<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> import and export functionality later in the <em class="italic">Creating and refining backlogs</em> section.</p>
			<p>Now that we know our way around the navigation menu, configuration bar, and the workspace, let's see how Jira Align can help orient our colleagues who are new to the application.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Facilitating onboarding</h1>
			<p>It is common<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> practice to onboard users into Jira Align one program or team of teams at a time. When onboarding programs into Jira Align, a common challenge is aligning teams on practices and ways of working. A best practice for handling this is to train everyone on the team of teams together just before launching a program. Mapping your practices and ways of working to your tools and the modules within them can be another challenge. Jira Align solves this by offering a number of ways to get new users up and running in the platform as quickly as possible. Let's look first at its <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>framework maps module.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Framework maps</h2>
			<p>Jira Align can facilitate<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> aligning your team of teams with your selected scaling framework (see <a href="B16328_01_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor016"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Jira Align</em>, in the <em class="italic">Selecting a framework</em> section). Frameworks such as SAFe include an overview illustration that summarizes the methods and practices for teams at each level of scale. You can simply add this illustration inside Jira Align and make it interactive so that when users click on a section in the illustration, they will be directed to a corresponding module within Jira Align or relevant external videos and training sources.</p>
			<p>As an example, the following screenshot shows an interactive framework map set up to show the Portfolio SAFe Big Picture:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.14_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.14 – Jira Align framework maps"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.14 – Jira Align framework maps</p>
			<p>In this example, the <strong class="bold">Strategic Themes</strong> section is linked to the <strong class="bold">Strategy Room</strong> module within Jira Align. This interactive approach is a great way for users to get familiarized with both practices and tools. It also serves as a resource for continuing education of teams at all levels.</p>
			<p>To add a new interactive picture, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">First go to <strong class="bold">Transform</strong> | <strong class="bold">Framework Maps</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Enterprise</strong>, <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong>, <strong class="bold">Solution</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Program</strong> menus of the navigation bar.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Interactive Image</strong> button and then provide a meaningful name for your new framework map and click on <strong class="bold">Add</strong>.</li>
				<li>Next, select the image file to add as the new framework map and click on <code>*.gif</code>, <code>*.jpeg</code>, <code>*.jpg</code>, <code>*.png</code>, and <code>*.bmp</code>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Define Interactive Section</strong> button to simply click and drag to create interactive <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>sections in the image. Next click on <strong class="bold">Save Section</strong> to confirm the defined sections.</li>
				<li>Next, enter the following details for each interactive section:<p><code>Strategic Themes</code>. Click on the pencil icon next to the name to rename it.</p><p><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: Add a description of the interactive section.</p><p><strong class="bold">Persona</strong>: You can optionally choose a persona for the interactive section that will allow a group of interactive sections to be highlighted for a given persona such as RTE.</p><p><strong class="bold">Step Link</strong>: Look up and add a Jira Align module.</p><p><strong class="bold">Use Video/Ext Link</strong>: You can toggle this on/off to add a video or external link to the interactive section.</p></li>
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Save &amp; Close</strong> to save the changes, and then return to <em class="italic">step 4</em> to add details on all defined interactive sections. To confirm the updates, click on <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. If you need to return to make further changes to your interactive sections, you can click on the <strong class="bold">Edit Interactive Sections</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows an interactive section being edited:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.15_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.15 – Jira Align framework maps' interactive section"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.15 – Jira Align framework maps' interactive section</p>
			<p>Framework maps are<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> one of the many cool features in Jira Align and the only limitation will be your imagination in making the most out of this module. Let's take a look at what other resources are available to facilitate user onboarding in Jira Align.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>Training simulations</h2>
			<p>Jira Align <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>provides pre-built training modules that are accessible from the configuration bar checklists icon, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.16_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.16 – Jira Align training simulations"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.16 – Jira Align training simulations</p>
			<p>Here you will find 8 <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>hours of interactive videos on how the tool supports the following lean and agile practices: PI planning, backlog refinement, inspect and adapt, custom Kanban, product road mapping, scrum of scrums, conduct team ceremonies, lean budgeting, portfolio tracking, portfolio planning, time tracking, lean Kanban for essentials, Jira integration, product strategy, value engineering, and ideation. This wealth of knowledge can be accessed by any Jira Align user on-demand to learn more about the modules and how to practice lean-agile methods effectively.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Checklists</h2>
			<p>Another way to help <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>get team members familiarized with Jira Align is to create a custom checklist with a sequence of steps to follow in order to complete specific tasks in Jira Align. You can build custom checklists specific to personas such as PMO or RTE, or practices such as backlog refinement and PI planning. Checklists are accessible from the configuration bar checklists icon, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.17_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.17 – Jira Align checklists"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.17 – Jira Align checklists</p>
			<p>There are three types of custom checklists that you can create:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Private checklist</strong>: You can create an individual checklist for your personal task tracking purposes. The checklist will only be available to you.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Public individual checklist</strong>: You can create an individual shared checklist with others, but the steps will be tracked individually. For example, you can build a common checklist for Scrum Masters, but they could all be at different stages on the list.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Public shared checklist</strong>: You can create a public shared checklist that multiple users can collaborate on. When one user checks an item on the list, other users associated with the checklist can see that that item has been checked. Public shared checklists are typically tied to rooms such as the program room to drive practices for large groups or efforts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Let's see what it takes <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>to build a PI planning custom checklist for our Mutants program. On the bottom of the checklist menu, click on <strong class="bold">Create New</strong> and then provide the following details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Mutants PI Planning</code>.</li>
				<li><code>PI Planning checklist for superheroes</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Public</code> to share this checklist with others. This option will expand the following additional details to be completed:<p>a. <code>Shared</code> usage option to track the checklist as a team of teams.</p><p>b. <code>Room</code> option to share the checklist with everyone in the shared room. This option will expand the following two additional details.</p><p>c. <code>Programs Room</code>.</p><p>d. <code>Mutants</code>.</p><p>e. <strong class="bold">Users and/or Roles</strong>: You can specify additional users and/or roles with whom to share the checklist. When the checklist is shared, this information is optional.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that the required information is entered on the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> tab as shown, click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to create the checklist:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.18_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.18 – Jira Align checklist creation"/>
				</div>
			</div>

			<p>Next, click on<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> the <strong class="bold">List Items</strong> tab as shown in the screenshot to add the checklist steps. For each step, provide the following details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Get inspired</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Share the company's mission and vision</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Strategic Snapshots</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now it's time to create the sequence of steps for the checklist by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add Item</strong> button, as<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> shown, and repeat as necessary:</p>

Click on the checklist item's title, such as <code>Review Backlog</code>, to be directed to the Jira Align module that has been linked to that step. When the step is completed, click on the checkmark icon next to each step to signify its completion. When all the steps are checked, the checklist is complete.</p>
			<p>When you hover over the checklist, it will display a menu along the top right, as you can see in the preceding screenshot. Here you can select the program or PI in order to track the <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>progress for shared checklists. In addition, you will have the option to toggle the checklist size, edit the checklist, and close the checklist to exit.</p>
			<p>Now that we've seen how to get teams up and running in Jira Align, let's look at how they can begin working with a key element of agile, the product backlog.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Creating and refining backlogs</h1>
			<p>A backlog is simply<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> a prioritized list of work items with the most<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> important items at the top signifying that they should be worked on first. There are six levels of backlog in Jira Align: theme, portfolio epic, feature (Jira epic), story, task, and defect, as well as an optional capability level. Typically, portfolio managers and epic owners manage the theme and epic backlogs, solution managers manage the capability backlog, product managers manage the feature backlog, and product owners manage the story backlog.</p>
			<p>If you have connected to an existing Jira Software instance from Jira Align (as we covered in <a href="B16328_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Jira Align</em>), then your Jira epics, stories, and sub-tasks will flow into Jira Align as features, stories, and tasks and then bi-directionally sync between the two applications.</p>
			<p>If you have not yet connected to Jira, or if you want to import higher-level work items to connect to the lower-level work items from Jira, you can use Jira Align's file import functionality. But before we explore that, let's review how work items at each level are linked.</p>
			<p>Let's assume that features, stories, and tasks have come in from Jira and that we now wish to connect these team-level work items to higher-level strategic themes and portfolio epics. Let's also assume, as is common in organizations new to Jira Align, that theme and epic information can be gathered and put into spreadsheets for import into Jira Align. This will allow for full linkage between strategy and execution, as we saw in <em class="italic">Figure 2.9</em>, in the<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> previous chapter. Let's explore that linkage further<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> from the top down.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Linking work items</h2>
			<p>At the highest level, the <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>enterprise strategy is a long-term plan of action designed to achieve a set of goals or objectives. Below that comes themes, the highest-level work item in Jira Align, which link up to strategic goals. A theme is a long-term set of epics that connects a portfolio to an enterprise strategy. Each portfolio epic is a funded effort that spans several business quarters and requires new development to realize business benefits contributing to the theme to which it is linked in Jira Align.</p>
			<p>Portfolio epics are comprised of either capabilities or features. A capability is an optional work item level representing a collection of features supporting the portfolio epic to which it is linked in Jira Align. Capabilities are typically sized to be delivered within a business quarter and are complex enough to require the coordinated effort of multiple programs. A feature is a service fulfilling a stakeholder need, supporting either the capability or portfolio epic to which it is linked, and sized to be delivered in one business quarter by a single program.</p>
			<p>At the lowest level is the story, the fundamental unit of customer value supporting a feature and sized to be delivered in one sprint or iteration. The story is the basic building block and connected all the way up to top-level strategy in Jira Align. The beauty of this is that the full linkage from any work item is visible by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Why?</strong> button in the details panel. Thus, at a glance, any team member can see how their efforts are valuable to the mission of their company. For example, clicking the <strong class="bold">Why?</strong> button on a story shows information for its parent feature, epic, and theme, as well as any associated <strong class="bold">WSJF</strong> (<strong class="bold">Weighted Shortest Job First</strong>) scores, success measurements, and business cases, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.22_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.22 – Jira Align Why? button"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.22 – Jira Align Why? button</p>
			<p>Here we see the <strong class="bold">Why?</strong> details<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> panel to the left of the story details panel. The story is linked all the way up to a top-ranking theme connected to corporate strategy.</p>
			<p>In the same story's details panel, let's now click on the <strong class="bold">Requirement Hierarchy</strong> link on the right, three positions down from the <strong class="bold">State</strong> dropdown. This provides a visual of the linkage up and down the chain from any work item, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.23_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.23 – Jira Align requirement hierarchy"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.23 – Jira Align requirement hierarchy</p>
			<p>Here we see the story in context with its sibling story, their parent feature, and the linked epic and theme above that. You can click on each item in the hierarchy to open its details panel. For example, let's click on the feature to open its details panel:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.24_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.24 – Jira Align feature details panel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.24 – Jira Align feature details panel</p>
			<p>To then return to<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> the original work item, in this case, <code>Story 26708</code>, simply click on the bar to the left of the panel. In this way, related work items can be explored from any level in the hierarchy.</p>
			<p>In Jira Align, unlinked items are called <em class="italic">orphans</em>. It is common practice for team members at each level to review orphans and connect them up to higher-level items to promote visibility and tie execution to strategy. For this reason, each level of backlog in Jira Align has an <strong class="bold">Orphan Objects</strong> button near the top right of the workspace. For example, let's go to the story backlog and click on <strong class="bold">Orphan Objects</strong> to find stories not connected to features. These will be shown in a panel on the right side of the workspace:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.25_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.25 – Jira Align story backlog orphan objects panel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.25 – Jira Align story backlog orphan objects panel</p>
			<p>Here you can click on a story to see its details and use the checkboxes on the right to multi-select stories<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> to assign to a feature, which you can search for by ID, name, or tags. This makes it easy to connect each level of backlog item to its parent item.</p>
			<p>Now that we know the importance of linking work items at all levels to connect strategy with execution, let's go through the steps of importing. We will import portfolio epics in this example.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Importing and exporting</h2>
			<p>As mentioned<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> previously in the <em class="italic">Workspace</em> section, work item <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>grids at all levels allow for advanced actions, including importing and exporting. To access this functionality, go to the grid for any level work item. In this case, we are assuming that features and stories have come into a new Jira Align instance from the Jira connector and that we now need to import epics to which the features will be linked. To begin, go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Epics</strong>. Next, click on <strong class="bold">More Actions</strong> | <strong class="bold">Import Epics</strong>. This will display instructions and tips in the workspace, along with a drop-down list to select your program and a button to download the Excel workbook import template.</p>
			<p>Once you've downloaded the template, select the tab for the work item you'd like to import and fill it out. Note that asterisks in the header indicate required fields and that it's important not to modify the four header rows. Next, save the file without changing its format. Return to the workspace and select your program from the aforementioned dropdown. Next, click on <strong class="bold">Browse</strong> to select the file and then click on the <strong class="bold">Import Data</strong> button. Finally, navigate to <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Backlog</strong> to see the results. Voilà! You've now got a backlog of portfolio epics!</p>
			<p>Now you can go<a id="_idIndexMarker152"/> to <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Backlog</strong> and click<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> on <strong class="bold">Orphan Objects</strong> to multi-select features to assign to the newly imported epics in a similar manner to the assignment of stories to features shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.25</em>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">As a guide in filling out the import template, it is helpful to refer to an exported file of real data you are familiar with for reference, since the layout of the import and export files are the same. To export epics, go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Epics</strong>. Next, click on <strong class="bold">More Actions</strong> | <strong class="bold">Export Epics</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout">It's advisable to do a test import of one or two rows before importing an entire spreadsheet of dozens or hundreds of rows.</p>
			<p class="callout">If you need to adjust the associated metadata for several work items in Jira Align, you can export them, modify the spreadsheet, and then reimport them. This can be used, for example, to bulk change the parent capability or epic for numerous features.</p>
			<p class="callout">When working remotely, it may be helpful to export your backlog to have as a backup in case of internet connectivity issues.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Creating work items</h2>
			<p>While viewing the<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> epic and feature backlogs, you can quickly add new work items by entering a name and clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.26_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.26 – Jira Align backlog add button"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.26 – Jira Align backlog add button</p>
			<p>This allows for a quick add with only the essential elements. Here we've added a new epic. Note the prompt informing us that features can be quickly added under the epic by again entering a name and clicking on <strong class="bold">Add</strong>. Also, note that you can click on the pointing arrow symbol at the far left of any work item's row to expand it and show the children work items.</p>
			<p>Let's now assume we want to go back and add more details to our epic. To do so, we click on the epic's name<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> or ID in the backlog to open the details panel as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.27_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.27 – Jira Align epic details panel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.27 – Jira Align epic details panel</p>
			<p>Here you will find several tabs for the entry of associated benefits, value, finance, and other data. Clicking on <strong class="bold">Full Details</strong> expands or hides additional fields for the entry of capitalization, investment type, strategic driver, and more. Note that the Jira administrator can set which fields are displayed and required in the details panel for each work item type under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Details Panel Settings</strong>. These settings are per portfolio, so everyone in the portfolio, including its programs and teams, will have the same set of fields.</p>
			<p>Scrolling down in the details panel, you will find where to associate features, acceptance criteria, risks, success criteria, dependencies, objectives, links, and attachments. Clicking on <strong class="bold">Features</strong> will expand<a id="_idIndexMarker156"/> that section to show the fields, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.28_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.28 – Jira Align epic details panel, features section"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.28 – Jira Align epic details panel, features section</p>
			<p>Here you can either quick-add a new feature under the epic or search for an existing feature to link to it. In this manner, you'll be able to assign features that came in from Jira to the portfolio epics imported in our preceding example.</p>
			<p>Note that you do not have to be in the backlog to add work items. Jira Align allows you to add work items of any level, as well as other types of items, at any time by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button at the far right of the configuration bar.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">Product managers can add features to their backlogs without syncing them with Jira. This allows them to refine the features until they are ready.</p>
			<p class="callout">To keep a feature in Jira Align, the product manager would not make a selection from the Jira Project dropdown on the feature's details panel.</p>
			<p class="callout">Once the feature is ready for teams to see in Jira, the product manager can select a Jira project from the dropdown, allowing the feature to flow into Jira.</p>
			<p>Now that you know <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>how to import and create work items for your backlog, let's learn some basic refinement techniques.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Ranking work items</h2>
			<p>A well-refined backlog<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> will be ordered by rank so that the team knows what to work on next. Note that while team-level backlogs of stories will be maintained in Jira, it's common practice for program, solution, and portfolio backlogs to be maintained in Jira Align, which is generally deemed to be the system of record for features, capabilities, and portfolio epics.</p>
			<p>Jira Align provides two methods of ranking: manual and automated. The simplest way is to manually drag and drop the work item to a higher or lower position in the backlog list, which is in ranked order. You could also right-click on the work item and move it to the top, bottom, or a specified position in the backlog.</p>
			<p>Automated ranking allows you to pull rank based on the ranking of higher-level work items. For example, if the portfolio team has ranked epics and you'd like to rank your features according to the rank of their parent epics, you can go to <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Backlog</strong>, click on the <strong class="bold">Pull Rank</strong> button, and select <strong class="bold">Use Epic</strong>.</p>
			<p>While manual and automated ranking are simple to do, there are a couple of important things to keep in mind. The first is that work items are always ranked relative to other work items of the same type. The second is that work items actually have several independent ranks based on how your configuration bar is set.</p>
			<p>Global rank is the default ranking when the configuration bar is clear, meaning no specific portfolio, program, or PI is selected. If a PI is selected in the configuration bar, you will be viewing the rank for that particular PI. If a portfolio or program is selected, you will see the rank within that particular portfolio or program. If you select a portfolio and PI or program and PI, you will be viewing the rank within that portfolio or program for that specific PI. The lowest level is selecting a team and a sprint, for which you will see the ranking of items worked on by that team in a particular sprint.</p>
			<p>There is another nuance regarding ranking. Earlier we noted that clicking on the pointing arrow symbol at the left of any row in a backlog list will expand the work item to show its children. Assuming there are several children, they can be dragged up and down under the parent to represent a sequence or rank; however, this is independent from the rank of those items when listed with all others of the same type. In other words, you can change the order in which features appear under a parent epic when its row is expanded, but that won't affect, for example, the program feature ranking you will see when you view the feature backlog and have a program selected in the configuration bar. This is where visibility of all work and rankings within the platform can drive discussions, for example, between epic owners and product managers, who must collaborate to ensure<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> that their independent rankings of epics and features are aligned.</p>
			<p>Lastly, we will note that Jira Align allows you to manually synchronize feature and story rankings between Jira Align and Jira. This option is only available in the feature and story backlogs when a program is selected in the configuration bar and no PI are selected. Note that the Jira Align administrator must enable this option in <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Connectors</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Setup</strong>. Here, the administrator must enter the Jira rank field ID under <strong class="bold">Custom Fields</strong> and set <strong class="bold">Enable Rank Sync</strong> to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> under settings. Once these settings are made, you will have two additional options when you click on the <strong class="bold">Pull Rank</strong> button in the backlog, one to pull rank from Jira, and the other to push rank to Jira.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">If, after pulling rank from Jira for your features, you'd like to apply that ranking to a particular PI, first add the PI to your configuration bar so that your program and PI are selected. Then use the <strong class="bold">Pull Rank</strong> button again, this time selecting <strong class="bold">Use Program rank to sort Features</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Estimating work items</h2>
			<p>Another facet of a<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> refined backlog is that it's estimated. Estimates at all levels enable learning and predictability. For example, as a scrum team learns its average velocity (story points completed per sprint), it can estimate how many sprints it will take to complete a feature based on an initial point estimate for the feature. Later, when that feature is broken down into stories that are sized, the aggregate story points can be compared with the initial estimate for learning purposes.</p>
			<p>While team-level story point estimates are typically done in Jira, Jira Align provides three options for how to size features, capabilities, and epics. They are, in order of popularity, t-shirt size, points, and team/member weeks. The last option may be useful in a bimodal environment where some portfolios are using waterfall development. The Jira Align administrator sets the estimation option for each portfolio in <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio Specific Configuration</strong>. This allows each portfolio to have its own estimation approach, which will be uniform throughout the portfolio, including its programs and teams.</p>
			<p>If t-shirt size is the chosen estimation method, then Jira Align will convert t-shirt sizes to points for reports, grid views, and functionality, such as the PI load widget in the program room. The Jira Align administrator sets the conversion parameters in <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Estimation Conversions</strong>. Here is an example:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.29_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.29 – Jira Align estimation conversions example"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.29 – Jira Align estimation conversions example</p>
			<p>There are two <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>important considerations to note here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>There is no accepted standard for the conversion of t-shirt sizes to team weeks and story points. Each organization will experiment and learn what works best for their context.</li>
				<li>The same conversion table applies to the entire Jira Align instance, including all portfolios.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Because portfolios may differ in terms of the conversion parameters, we recommend using points as the estimation method. This also ensures that reports and widgets are intuitive, as users could be confused by the t-shirt to point conversion.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">Whether you choose t-shirt size or points as your default estimation method, you can still have a field to store the other estimation type. We recommend setting points as the default, with t-shirt size as the secondary field.</p>
			<p class="callout">To have a secondary estimation field, ask your Jira Align administrator to add it as a custom field in <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Details Panels Settings</strong>. Here they would select the portfolio and work item and then click on <strong class="bold">Add Custom Field</strong>. They would then toggle the custom field on in <strong class="bold">Details Panels Settings.</strong></p>
			<p class="callout">You can view the<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> original point estimate for features, capabilities, and epics alongside the sum of all story points rolling up from their children in your backlog and grid views. To do so, click on the <strong class="bold">Columns Shown</strong> button near the top right of the workspace, and then add both the <strong class="bold">Points</strong> (original point estimate) and <strong class="bold">Story Points</strong> (rollup of points as estimated by team members at the story level) columns.</p>
			<p class="callout">Important note: the Jira Align administrator must toggle on both <strong class="bold">Points</strong> and <strong class="bold">Story Points</strong> in <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Details Panels Settings</strong> for each portfolio and work item type in order for the preceding to work.</p>
			<p class="callout">To see work items without estimates, you can scan those columns in your backlog or grid views. You can also click on the <strong class="bold">Orphan Objects</strong> button in the backlog. Aside from showing unlinked items, as we saw in <em class="italic">Figure 3.25</em>, you can scroll down for more information, including items without estimates.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Deleting work items</h2>
			<p>Usually, only the<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> Jira Align administrator has permission to delete. Other roles may be granted permission to move work items to the recycle bin. Note that if a work item that came into Jira Align from Jira is later deleted or archived in Jira, it will remain in Jira Align for audit purposes. It can be moved to the recycle bin if necessary. To view the recycle bin, go to a work item grid, for example, <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Features</strong>, and then click on <strong class="bold">More Actions</strong> | <strong class="bold">Access Recycle Bin</strong>.</p>
			<p>In rare cases, a Jira Align administrator may need to delete an entire team, program, or portfolio. If this is the case, for referential integrity, objects must be deleted from bottom to top of the hierarchy in this sequence: tasks, stories, features, epics/capabilities, themes, sprints, PI, teams, programs, portfolios, snapshot, and<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> organization.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">The Jira Align administrator can generate a report of items that were deleted in Jira by going to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Connectors</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Management</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Deleted Issues</strong>. (This was already covered in <a href="B16328_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Jira Align</em>, in the <em class="italic">Connecting to Jira</em> section.)</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Searching for work items</h2>
			<p>Jira Align provides <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>search boxes on all work item backlog and grid views so that you can find the exact item you are looking for within that view. Simply type the name or ID in the search box. You can also perform a global search for work items across all portfolios, programs, and teams to which you have access. To do so, click on the search icon (magnifying glass) near the right side of the configuration bar. This allows you to search by name or ID; however, note that here, an ID number must be preceded by the # sign, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.30_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.30 – Jira Align global work item search"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.30 – Jira Align global work item search</p>
			<p>Simply click on the item once it is found, in this case, a story with an ID of <code>26708</code>, to open its details panel.</p>
			<p>At this point, your backlog is built, ranked, and estimated. You know how to create, search for, and<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> delete work items. Now it's time to begin collaborating with your fellow teammates on delivering those items.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Collaborating in Jira Align</h1>
			<p>As part of team <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>collaboration, it is key that work is visible, tracked, and monitored. Jira Align supports this with sophisticated email and alert notifications on those work items that need attention. Notifications are a great way to receive info on specific events without being tied to your desk.</p>
			<p>In order to receive notifications via email, you need the <strong class="bold">Change Tracking Emails</strong> preference option toggled on in your user preferences. This will enable you to receive emails for subscriptions, notifications, and workflow generated notifications:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.31_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.31 – Jira Align change tracking emails preference"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.31 – Jira Align change tracking emails preference</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">Jira Align administrators can set the default preference to be always turned on by going to the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> | <strong class="bold">Users</strong> tab and setting the <strong class="bold">Personal User Notification</strong> dropdown to <strong class="bold">Default To On</strong>. They can select the <strong class="bold">Reset All Users</strong> button to push the default setting to all users.</p>
			<p>Whether you choose to receive email notifications or not, you will also receive alert notifications via the<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> bell icon near the right side of the configuration bar:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.32_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 3.32 – Jira Align notification bell"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.32 – Jira Align notification bell</p>
			<p>These alerts are a great alternative to email notifications, as they keep team members informed within the Jira Align interface. The red dot signifies unread alert notifications. The <strong class="bold">Action Required</strong> section lists notifications that require actions such as approval, and the <strong class="bold">Subscription/Updates</strong> section lists notifications that require collaboration, including subscriptions, discussions, and workflow email notifications.</p>
			<p>Alert notifications are heavily utilized by organizations that choose to turn off email notifications completely in order to reduce information overload. In order to receive these alerts, you must <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>subscribe to work items in Jira Align, which we will learn about next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Subscribing to notifications</h2>
			<p>You can choose <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>to subscribe to notifications on work items by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Subscribe</strong> option. Once you subscribe, you will receive notifications. You can stop notifications by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Unsubscribe</strong> option at any time:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.33 – Jira Align work item discussions and subscribing</p>
			<p>Here are the work items, timeboxes, and planning artifacts that support the <strong class="bold">Subscribe</strong> function: themes, portfolio epics, capabilities, features, stories, tasks, defects, dependencies, risks, sprints, goals, specifications, brainstorming, success criteria, feeds, ideas, hotfixes, and UI designs.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Starting a discussion</h2>
			<p>You can start<a id="_idIndexMarker171"/> discussions for work items and <code>@mention</code> someone to generate a notification or alert. You will find the <code>@mention</code>, the helper will find the closest match to help autocomplete the recipient of the notification. Here is an example discussion:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.34 – Jira Align discussions</p>
			<p>All communications will be highlighted using a red balloon annotation in the work item's details panel to indicate the number of discussions. For example, there is one discussion shown previously in <em class="italic">Figure 3.33</em>. You can also quickly access the discussions when the <strong class="bold">Chat</strong> column is displayed on a work item grid page. Here are the items that support notifications via the <strong class="bold">Discussion</strong> link: portfolio epics, capabilities, features, stories, defects, impediments, and brainstorming.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Configuring workflow emails</h2>
			<p>You can create email<a id="_idIndexMarker172"/> workflows to alert others and yourself automatically when a work item, team, or timebox is created, edited, or deleted. The workflow configurations are applied to an entire organization, including portfolios, programs, and teams. You can notify all roles within a program, agile team roles, or individual email addresses. You can configure the workflows under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Email</strong> by selecting the workflow type and choosing the roles to notify:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.35 – Jira Align email workflow</p>
			<p>Several work<a id="_idIndexMarker173"/> items, timeboxes, and planning artifacts support email workflows, including portfolio epics, features, stories, defects, PI, release vehicles, and more. Some of these workflow types have additional attributes for configuring the workflow, some allow you to assign a role to be notified, and some allow you to add external emails to be notified.</p>
			<p>There are specific work items in Jira Align that allow you to set up special workflows under certain conditions. For example, when creating a strategic snapshot, you can set up a notification for funding approval and funding change that emails individuals based on the workflow rules you set. The following screenshot shows how notifications are enabled for updates<a id="_idIndexMarker174"/> on strategic snapshots:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.36 – Jira Align strategic snapshot notifications</p>
			<p>You can also set up notifications for when a feature reaches a specific state in the workflow. To do so, go to <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Features</strong> | <strong class="bold">More Actions</strong> | <strong class="bold">Workflow</strong>. Here is<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> how you can set up the workflow states to notify one or more individuals:</p>

			<p>You can also set up special workflow notifications on Kanban boards, value streams, defects, risks, PI status reports, and announcements.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Setting up scheduled emails</h2>
			<p>If you need to set<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> up regular email communications, speak with your Jira Align administrator to schedule emails at a specific date/time. You can notify your teams to communicate reminders on deadlines and time-specific deliverables. The scheduled notifications are created by going to the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Email</strong> | <strong class="bold">Scheduled Email</strong> tab and then clicking on the <strong class="bold">Create New</strong> button. Here are the details to add when creating a scheduled email:</p>
