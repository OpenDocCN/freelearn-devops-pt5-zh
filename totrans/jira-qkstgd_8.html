                    <h1 class="header-title">Best Practices</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this, the final chapter, we will focus on a number of best practices that you should always keep in mind when using Jira. You must have already realized that Jira is quite a flexible tool when it comes to customizing it, based on your requirements. At the same time, it is very important that configuration changes in Jira are done carefully from the outset and that you are aware of the consequences if these customizations are not performed correctly. Observing best practices will ensure the longevity and top-notch performance of your Jira instance.</p>
<p>Topics covered in this chapter include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Setting up a change control board</li>
<li>Documenting your configurations</li>
<li>Not creating too many statuses</li>
<li>Not creating lots of custom fields</li>
<li>Using contexts</li>
<li>Using project roles over groups</li>
<li>Not modifying default configurations</li>
<li>Jira customization process</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up a change control board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If your organization has just started using Jira, or wants to use it, then the very first thing that should be done is to set up some sort of change control board. Jira can be installed easily at the outset for piloting and, especially if you are planning to use Jira Cloud, then it literally takes minutes to set up a new instance and you can start using it straight away, mainly because Jira comes with project templates. However, as the number of teams expands and Jira is adopted by many of them, the majority will ask the administrator to modify the projects slightly based on their requirements.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Since Jira is quite easy to modify, it might be tempting to just implement the new changes straight away, and this is what we want to warn you about. Treat Jira like any other project and, in the beginning, create a standard set of configurations that can be used by a wide range of teams. Although Jira administrators are responsible for the tool, they should also advocate the standardization of various processes. For example, if there are two teams working in the same company on a similar project, then ideally, they both should be using the same configurations in Jira.</p>
<p>The purpose of the change control board is to ensure that, on an ongoing basis, the Jira customizations are done by first reviewing the changes, challenging the team, and advising them on using standard configurations.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Documenting your configurations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The worst nightmare of Jira administrators is a Jira instance with hundreds of workflows and other customizations without any idea of their purpose. Jira instances can grow big very quickly in an enterprise setup and that is why it is absolutely imperative that the configurations executed in the tool from the very outset are documented in detail. It may seem cumbersome, but once it is done from the very beginning, it helps the Jira administrators a lot in maintaining the instance. You need to ensure that, with every customization undertaken in the tool, and not just at the start but on an ongoing basis as well, the document is also updated.</p>
<p>Documenting is important because, when a new person joins the team of Jira administrators, they can always refer to the documentation to understand the purpose of the configuration. This document should ideally contain the purpose of the configuration, target project types, actual configurations, and feedback from the stakeholders or your users.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Not creating too many statuses</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Workflows are one of the main aspects of Jira customizations. They define the life cycle of an issue as it goes through different stages. A workflow has a variety of statuses, and various transitions between them. Sometimes, when a new workflow is created, there might be a requirement to create a new status. Now, before creating a new status, please go through the existing list of statues in your instance and check whether any of those existing statuses can be reused.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Reusing a status is only possible when their names are a bit generic and not overly project-specific. For example, <strong>Awaiting feedback</strong> and <strong>Feedback awaited</strong> are more or less the same, and there is no need to create a status such as <strong>Feedback 123</strong>.</p>
<p>Statuses are created globally and Jira workflows can use them, which is why you should not try to create too many statuses.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Not creating lots of custom fields</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Earlier in this book, we learned how to create custom fields. The purpose of these fields is to store some additional information that is otherwise not possible with default system fields in Jira.</p>
<p>Too many custom fields is the biggest reason for slow performance in Jira. There really is no reason to have hundreds of custom fields in Jira and caution should be exercised when creating a new custom field. Just as with statuses, try to reuse a custom field and also try to create custom fields with generic names.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at some generic custom fields that can be created in Jira instances:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Custom field</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Type</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Description</strong></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Client/customer</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Select List</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This uses Project Context to create different options for multiple projects</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Category</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Select List</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Labels and components should be used in most cases, but this generic field can be used in many projects with different options using Project Context</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>External ID</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Text Field</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This field will be used to store the ID of the issue, which is stored in an external tool</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Type of testing</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Select List</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>This field can be used when Jira is used for test management</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Start date</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Date Picker</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Jira does come with a due date, but the start date of a task is not available</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>As you can see in the preceding table, the idea is to optimize field utilization. Since these fields store information for every project and issues therein, the performance of the instance can be degraded if there are lots of fields.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using contexts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the previous section, we discussed optimizing the use of custom fields, but sometimes, the same custom field requires a different set of options for each project. For example, a field such as Customer name can have different options based on the team or project, and w e are talking about a Select List type of field.</p>
<p>In such scenarios, we highly recommend that you use custom field contexts that will let you create different sets of options based on the project, but where the fields remain the same.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using project roles over groups</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Maintaining a Jira instance, especially in a growing organization, can be a daunting task. There are a number of activities that can only be done by Jira administrators, so you should ensure that project administrators are also able to manage their projects as much as they can. This is especially true when more people are added to the project. There are many configurations, such as permissions, notifications, and workflows, that are based on users. When creating these configurations, if you use a Jira group instead of project roles, then your project administrators are dependent on you to add/remove people, but they do have permissions to manage their own team of users using project roles. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Not modifying default configurations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira comes with a lot of templates and default configurations, as you may have seen earlier. These configurations help you get started with Jira quickly but, as a good practice, you should never modify them directly. If you want to use any of the default configurations, feel free to copy them and then modify the copied version.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Jira customization process</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Finally, let's summarize the customization process that you can employ to kick-start the use of Jira in your organization. It is based on the best practices that we discussed earlier.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>You can perform these steps to begin the customization process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Pilot Jira with default configurations</li>
<li>Gather feedback</li>
<li>Document the proposed configurations</li>
<li>Test the configurations in a sandbox</li>
<li>Implement them in production</li>
<li>Standardize the configurations</li>
<li>Set up a change control board</li>
</ol>
<p>The preceding mentioned steps are self-explanatory, and we have already covered them either in this chapter or earlier in this book. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we looked at various best practices that you must employ in your organization when implementing Jira. The purpose of them is to not only ensure good performance of your instance, but to also ensure that administration of the instance does not become more difficult over time.</p>
<p>This was the final chapter in this book. Their purpose of this book was to get you started on Jira cloud instance quickly with a view to using them in your organization, but we also covered the customization aspects of Jira. We hope this book will empower you to start using Jira with confidence and we wish you all the best on your journey.</p>
