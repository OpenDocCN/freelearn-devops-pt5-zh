<p>With Role-Based Access <span>Control (RBAC) </span>in Azure, you can <span>implement the principle of least permissions and </span>give users the exact permissions they need to <span>do their jobs properly. Users, groups, and applications are added to roles in Azure, and those roles have certain permissions. You can use the built-in roles that Azure offers or you can create custom roles in RBAC. </span></p>
<p>The roles in Azure can be added to a certain scope. A Scope can be an Azure Subscription, an Azure Resource Group, or Web App, for instance. Azure then uses access inheritance. Roles added to a parent resource give access to child resources automatically. For instance, a group that is added to an Azure Subscription gets access to all the Resource Groups and underlying resources that are in that subscription as well. A user that is added to a virtual machine only gets access to that particular VM:</p>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign packt_figref"><span>Role-based Access Control inheritance</span></div>
<p><span>Within each Azure Subscription, you can grant up to </span><span>2,000 role assignments, which can be set from the Azure Portal, PowerShell, CLI, and the REST API.</span></p>

            <article>
                
<p>Azure offers various built-in roles that you can use for assigning permissions to users, groups, and applications. RBAC offers the following three standard roles that you can assign to each Azure resource:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Owner</strong>:<strong> </strong>Users in this role can manage everything and can create new resources</li>
<li><strong>Contributor</strong>:<strong> </strong>Users in this role can manage everything just like users in the owner role, but they can't assign access to others</li>
<li><strong>Reader</strong>:<strong> </strong>Users in this role can read everything, but are not allowed to make any changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Besides the standard roles, each Azure resource also has roles that are scoped to particular resources. For instance, you can assign users, groups, or applications to the SQL Security Manager, where they can manage all <span>security-related policies of the Azure SQL Servers, or you can assign them to the Virtual Machine Contributor role, where they can manage the VMs, but not the VNet or Storage account, which are connected to the VM.</span></p>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox">For an overview of all the built-in roles that Azure offers, you can refer to <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles</a>.</div>

<p>You can also create custom roles in RBAC when none of the built-in roles suit your needs. Custom roles can be <span>assigned to the exact same resources as built-in roles and can only be </span>created using PowerShell, CLI, and the REST API. You can't create them in the Azure Portal. In each Azure tenant, there can be up to 2,000 roles which have been created.</p>
<p>Custom roles are defined in JSON, and after deployment, they are stored inside the Azure AD tenant. By storing them inside the Azure AD tenant, they can be used in all the different Azure Subscriptions that are connected to the Azure AD tenant. </p>

<p>In Azure, you can create policies where you can define and enforce rules and actions for your Azure resources. Azure policies differ from RBAC because this is not about users, groups, or applications that need access, but Azure policies are about applying your organization's governance strategy. Azure can scan your resources, so they stay compliant with company rules and SLAs. For instance, you can create a policy that evaluates all virtual machines that use Managed Disks. </p>
<p>For creating policies, users must be granted the owner role in RBAC, or a custom role needs to be created where the following permissions need to be added to the JSON file:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To define policies</strong>: <kbd>Microsoft.Authorization/policydefinitions/write</kbd></li>
<li><strong>To assign policies</strong>: <kbd>Microsoft.Authorization/policyassignments/write</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>Policies can be created using the Azure Portal, PowerShell, and CLI. </p>
<div class="packt_infobox">To create a policy from the Azure Portal, you can refer to the following tutorial: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/assign-policy-definition">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-policy/assign-policy-definition</a>.</div>

<p>Azure AD Privileged Identity Management (PIM) is an Azure AD Premium P2 or Enterprise Mobility + Security E5 feature. With PIM, you can manage and control all access inside the Azure AD tenant, such as access to Azure resources, Office 365, Intune, and Azure AD. </p>
<p>In RBAC, you can grant permanent role access. With PIM, you can grant eligible role access to users. Users that don't need permanent access to resources <span>can request access for a predetermined amount of time when certain type of permissions are needed. For instance, a user can request temporary SharePoint Administrator permissions. This request can be approved by the Delegated Approver, and the permissions are deactivated when the user is done.</span></p>
<p> PIM uses the following flow:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>User Request</strong>:<strong> </strong>The users requests access using an online form for specific permissions for a predefined amount of time</li>
<li><strong>Request Review</strong>: The request gets reviewed by administrators inside the PIM Portal</li>
<li><strong>Approval</strong>:<strong> </strong> The request can be approved, and the user is added to the required role</li>
<li><strong>Notification</strong>:<strong> </strong>The user gets notified by email</li>
<li><strong>User performs the action</strong>: User signs in to Azure resource using MFA and Azure AD Privileged Identity Management elevates their privileges for a specific time-bound duration</li>
<li><strong>Monitoring</strong>: The monitoring team can track all the elevations in the PIM Portal</li>
</ul>

<p>Azure AD Identity Protection is a feature that is included in the Azure AD Premium P2 license. It offers premium protection for your identities in Azure by offering detection of identity-based security issues. It helps discovering compromised identities, offers conditional access policies, remediation of security events, and support for investigating security events. Azure uses machine learning algorithms for detection and generates reports and alerts to resolve threats.</p>
<p>Azure AD Identity Protection offers the following policies:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>MFA Registration</strong>: Here, you can assign the MFA policy where you can enforce your users to log in using MFA. </li>
<li><strong>User Risk Policy</strong>: This policy allows you to block users from signing in or enforce them to change their password to a more secure password.</li>
<li><strong>Sign-in Risk Policy</strong>: This policy offers protection when users sign in from unfamiliar locations. You can enforce them to use MFA when signing in from that particular location.</li>

<p>Advanced Threat Detection monitors the security information of all the Azure resources that are inside an Azure Subscription, hybrid environments, and connected third-party solutions. It analyzes the data to detect potential threats, and when it identifies a threat, it will create a security alert. This security alert provides detailed information about the threat, and it provides suggestions about how to solve the threat. </p>
<p>Azure uses machines learning algorithms to help detect threats. These <span>algorithms are used inside the entire Azure Cloud fabric and can be leveraged for all type of accounts, such as enterprise accounts and accounts for smaller organizations and personal accounts. They can all benefit from all the data that Microsoft has analyzed in the past decade.</span></p>
<p>Azure Security Center provides three types of threat reports that are generated using Advance Threat Detection. These reports can vary according to the attack:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Activity Group Report</strong>: This provides information about the attackers, such as the identities or associations, the objectives and the <span>tactics, and tools and procedures of the attackers.</span></li>
<li><strong>Campaign Report</strong><span>: This provides information about the current and historical attack campaigns.</span></li>
<li><strong>Threat Summary Report</strong><span>: This combines all the information from the previously mentioned reports.</span></li>

<p><strong>Operations Management Suite</strong> (<strong>OMS</strong>) is a hybrid cloud and data management tool from Microsoft, hosted in Azure, to manage <span>your on-premises and Azure infrastructure from one single place. With OMS, you can manage large hybrid environments easily. Besides Azure, OMS can also manage and protect AWS, Windows Server, Linux, VMWare, and OpenStack environments and machines. OMS offers different management solutions, and one of them is the Security and Compliance Solution.</span></p>
<p><span>To manage and protect VMs and servers, an agent needs to be installed, which collects all the data for OMS. To collect data from Azure, you need to create a <strong>Log Analytics Workspace</strong>. This workspace is created automatically when you associate your Azure Subscription with OMS.</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox"><span>You can associate OMS with your Azure Subscription from: </span><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/operations-management-suite">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-platform/operations-management-suite</a><span>. </span><br/>
<span>You can create a Log Analytics Workspace from the Azure Portal as well. For more information about how to create this, you can refer to:</span> <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/</a><span>.</span></div>
<p>To install the agent and connect Azure VMs to OMS, you can open the Log Analytics Workspace from the Azure Portal, click on <span class="packt_screen">Virtual machines</span> in the left menu, and connect your VM to the workspace:</p>

<br/>
Connect VM to OMS</span></div>
<p><span>The data will now be displayed in the OMS Portal. OMS offers a <span class="packt_screen">Security and Audit</span> dashboard, which provides the following areas of information:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Security Domains</strong>: This will provide information about security records, such as malware assessments, network security, identity, and access information</li>
<li><strong>Notable Issues</strong>: This will give information about current threats and issues</li>
<li><strong>Detections (Preview)</strong>: This helps identify attack patterns by visualization of alerts</li>
<li><strong>Threat Intelligence</strong>: This visualizes the total number of servers with different threats and a map that shows from which IP address the threats are coming</li>
</ul>
