			<p><strong class="bold">Projects</strong> are collections of issues, and <strong class="bold">issues</strong> are collections of fields. As we have seen in the earlier chapters, fields capture data, which can then be displayed to users. There are many different types of fields in Jira, ranging from simple text fields that let you input alphanumeric text, to more complicated fields with pickers to assist you with choosing dates and users.</p>
			<p>An information system is only as useful as the data that goes into it. By understanding how to effectively use fields, you can turn Jira into a powerful information system for data collection, processing, and reporting.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will expand our HR project with these customized fields and configurations, by exploring fields in detail and learning how they relate to other aspects of Jira. By the end of this chapter, you will have learned about the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding system and custom fields and searchers</li>
				<li>Managing and optimizing custom fields</li>
				<li>Adding behaviors to fields with field configurations</li>
				<li>Understanding field configuration schemes and how to apply them to projects</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Understanding system fields</h1>
			<p>Jira comes with several built-in <code>assignee</code> and <code>description</code>, are optional. These system fields are often tied directly into different features of Jira so you cannot remove them.</p>

			<p>While Jira’s built-in fields are enough for basic<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> general uses, most organizations soon find they have special requirements that cannot be addressed simply with the system fields available. In the next section, we will look at how Jira addresses this need by letting you create your own fields, called <strong class="bold">custom fields</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Understanding custom fields</h1>
			<p>One of the key features of Jira is custom<a id="_idIndexMarker335"/> fields, which let you add new fields to the system based on your needs. You can add a new user picker field to represent project stakeholders or a date picker field for different key dates.</p>
			<p>Every custom field is of a certain type that dictates its behavior, appearance, and functionality. Therefore, when you add a custom field to Jira, you are adding a custom field of the selected custom field type.</p>
			<p>Jira comes with over 20 custom field types that you can use straight out of the box. Many custom field types are identical to the built-in fields, such as <strong class="bold">Date Picker</strong>, which is like the <strong class="bold">Due Date</strong> field. They provide you with simplicity and flexibility that are not available with their built-in counterparts. The upcoming sections break down and list all the standard and advanced Jira custom field types and their characteristics.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Standard fields</h2>
			<p>These field types are the<a id="_idIndexMarker336"/> most basic field types in Jira. They are usually simple and straightforward to use, such as the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> field, which allows users to input any text:</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 5.3 – Advanced custom field types</p>
			<p>As you can see, Jira provides you with a comprehensive list of custom field types. In addition, there are many custom field types developed by third-party vendors (available as apps that you can add to your Jira to enhance its functionality). These custom fields provide many specialized functionalities, such as automatically calculating values and retrieving data from databases<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> directly or connecting to an external system. Once you install the plugin, the process of adding custom fields from other vendors is mostly the same as adding custom fields shipped with Jira.</p>
			<p>The following list shows some examples of apps that provide additional useful custom fields. You can find them on the Atlassian Marketplace at <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com">https://marketplace.atlassian.com</a>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Enhancer Plugin for Jira</strong>: This includes several custom fields that will automatically display dates when key <a id="_idIndexMarker339"/>events occur for an issue; for example, when the issue was last closed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Toolkit Plugin for Jira</strong>: This provides several <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>useful custom fields, such as showing statistics on users that participate in a given issue and the date when the issue was last commented on.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Elements Connect - external data fields</strong>: This provides a suite of custom fields that let you connect to databases, remote files, and web services to retrieve data and display it in Jira.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Electronic Signature for Jira</strong>: This lets users <a id="_idIndexMarker341"/>electronically sign issues in Jira as they work on them, for example, approving an issue to be closed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">ScriptRunner for Jira</strong>: This app allows <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>you to create your own custom fields and define their functionalities with scripts.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will cover more on<a id="_idIndexMarker343"/> third-party apps in <a href="B18644_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor346"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Jira and Third Party Apps</em>. So, now we have looked at custom fields, it is time to introduce searchers next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Understanding field searchers</h1>
			<p>For any information system, capturing data<a id="_idIndexMarker344"/> is only half of the equation. Users will need to be able to retrieve the data at a later stage, usually through searching, and Jira is no different. While fields in Jira are responsible for capturing and displaying data, it is their corresponding searchers that provide the search functionality.</p>
			<p>A custom field searcher determines how the data stored by the field will be indexed, and this will have an impact on how you can search its data. For example, a text custom field will index its data as raw text so you can run a fuzzy search such as the text starting with a particular character. A select list custom field, on the other hand, will index its data differently, so you can run searches against a particular option value or a list of option values. If a field does not have a searcher applied, then its data will not be indexed, and you will not be able to search its data.</p>
			<p>All fields that come with Jira have searchers associated with them by default, so you will be able to search issues according to their summary or assignee, without any further configuration. Some custom fields from third-party add-ons may have more than one searcher available. You can change the default searcher by editing the custom field.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">In the Jira UI, a searcher is <a id="_idIndexMarker345"/>referred to as a <em class="italic">search template</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Custom field context</h1>
			<p>System fields, such as <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> and <strong class="bold">Issue Type</strong>, are global across Jira. What this means is that these fields <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>are available to all issues and projects. Custom fields, on the other hand, can be applied to specific projects and issue types, also known as <strong class="bold">context</strong>.</p>
			<p>A custom field context is made up of a <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>combination of projects and issue types. When you are working with an issue, Jira will check the project and issue type of the current issue to determine whether there is a specific context that matches the combination. If one is found, Jira will display the custom field with any specific settings, such as selection options. However, if no context is found, the custom field will not be displayed.</p>
			<p>There are two main reasons to use custom field contexts, customization and performance. Let’s first look at how context can help customize a custom field.</p>
			<p>Custom field types, such as select lists and radio buttons, have options for end users to choose from. You can customize the list of options for different projects and issue types, or contexts. This allows you to reuse the same custom field for multiple projects, thus reducing duplication.</p>
			<p>The second benefit of using custom field context is performance. If you restrict your custom fields to specific project and issue types, it means when Jira is displaying an issue, it will only need to display custom fields that have contexts for the issue. The fewer custom fields Jira needs to display, the faster the response time will be.</p>
			<p>In Jira, if no context can be found that matches the project and issue type combination, a custom field does not exist for the issue. We will look at how to set custom field contexts in the <em class="italic">Adding custom field contexts</em> section later. What you need to remember now is that when adding a custom field, you need to make sure that it has the correct context setting.</p>
			<p>Now that we have briefly covered custom field context, let’s take a look at how you can create and manage custom fields.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Managing custom fields</h1>
			<p>Custom fields are <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>used globally across Jira, so you will need to have the Jira Administrator global permission to carry out management operations such as creation and configuration.</p>
			<p>Jira maintains all the custom fields in a centralized location for easy management. Perform the following steps to access the <strong class="bold">M</strong><strong class="bold">anage custom </strong><strong class="bold">field</strong> page:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Log in as a Jira administrator user.</li>
				<li>Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Custom </strong><strong class="bold">fields</strong> option:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.1_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – Manage custom fields&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1 – Manage custom fields</p>
			<p>On the <strong class="bold">Custom fields</strong> page, all the existing custom fields will be listed. From here, you can see the names of all custom fields, their type, the context they belong to, and the screens they are displayed on. Note that some custom fields, such as <strong class="bold">Development</strong> and <strong class="bold">Epic Colour</strong>, as shown in the preceding screenshot, come with Jira itself, and will have the <strong class="bold">LOCKED</strong> label next to their names. These fields serve special purposes in Jira, so their configurations cannot be changed. User-added custom fields, such as <strong class="bold">Approvers</strong>, do not have this restriction and can be updated at any time. Let’s start by adding a new custom field.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Adding a custom field</h2>
			<p>Adding a new custom field is a multistep process, and Jira provides a wizard to help you through it. There are two mandatory<a id="_idIndexMarker349"/> steps and an optional step when adding a new custom field. You need to first select the type of custom field. It is very important to choose the correct field type as this cannot be changed later. When you choose the field type, you need to consider how the field will be used, the type of data you want it to store, and how you would search the data.</p>
			<p>Once you have selected the custom field type, you need to give it a name, followed by options if you are adding a <strong class="bold">Select List</strong> custom field type. The final, optional, step is to decide which screens to add the field to.</p>
			<p>We will walk you through the process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Custom </strong><strong class="bold">fields</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add custom field</strong> button. This will bring you to <em class="italic">step 1</em> of the process, where you can select the custom field type.</li>
				<li>Search and select the custom field type you wish to add and click on <strong class="bold">Next</strong>. This will bring you to <em class="italic">step 2</em> of the process, where you can specify the custom field’s name and options. Note that once a field type has been selected, it cannot be changed after the field is created:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.2_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – Add custom field step 1&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2 – Add custom field step 1</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">If you do not see the field type you are looking for, select the <strong class="bold">All</strong> option from the left-hand side and then search again.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Enter values for the <strong class="bold">Name</strong> and <strong class="bold">Description</strong> fields. If you are creating a selection-based <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>custom field, such as a select list, you will also need to add its select options (you can update this list later):</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.3_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – Add custom field step 2&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Even though you can have multiple custom fields with the same name, this is usually not a good practice as it can lead to confusion later and make management difficult.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="5">Select the context for<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> the new custom field. You should restrict the context to the specific issue types and projects the custom field will be used for. You can change this context after the custom field is created.</li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4 – Add custom field step 3</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button. This will bring you to the final step of the process, where you can specify which screen you would like to add the field to. This step is optional, as the custom field<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> has already been added in Jira. You do not have to add the field onto a screen. We will discuss fields and screens in <a href="B18644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Screen Management</em>.</li>
				<li>Select the screens and click on <strong class="bold">Update</strong>. The following screenshot shows that the newly created field has been added to two screens:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.5_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – Add custom field step 4&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – Add custom field step 4</p>
			<p>Once a custom field has been created, you will see it on the selected screen when you are creating, editing, or viewing issues.</p>
			<p>Before you start adding new custom fields, you should always first see if there are existing custom fields that have served a similar purpose that you can reuse. For example, if you want to add a <a id="_idIndexMarker353"/>select list of departments, there could already be a <strong class="bold">Department</strong> custom field, and all you need to do is to add a new field context so it will have a different list of department options for your project. So, it is always a good practice to keep reusability in mind when adding a new custom field. Always think about how you could reuse existing fields and how a new field could be reused in the future. This will help reduce the number of custom fields and keep your Jira more manageable.</p>

			<p>Once a custom field has been created, you can edit its details at any time. You may already notice that there is a <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> option and an <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> option for each custom field. It may be confusing in the <a id="_idIndexMarker354"/>beginning to differentiate between the two. <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> specifies options related to the custom field context, which we will discuss in the following sections. <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> specifies options that are global across Jira for the custom field; these include its name, description, and search templates:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Custom </strong><strong class="bold">fields</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> option by clicking on the cog icon for the custom field you wish to edit from the list of custom fields.</li>
				<li>Change the custom field’s details, such as its name or search template.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Update</strong> button to apply the changes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When making changes to the <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>search templates for your custom fields, it is important to note that, while the change will take effect immediately, you need to perform a system re-index for Jira to return the correct search results. This is because, for each search template, the underlying search data structure may be different, and Jira will need to update its search index for the newly applied search template.</p>
			<p>For example, if you have a custom field that did not have a searcher and you have just applied a searcher to it, no results will be returned until you re-index Jira. When you make changes to the search template, Jira will alert you with a message that a re-index will be required, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.6_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – Change searcher&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.6 – Change searcher</p>
			<p>Jira will notify you that you will need to perform a re-index whenever you have added or modified a custom field, installed a third-party app that contains custom field modules, or made other configuration changes that may impact existing custom fields, as shown here. Since re-indexing can be a costly process that can take a long time to complete for a large Jira instance, you are not required to re-index every time Jira prompts you to do so. Generally, you should perform<a id="_idIndexMarker356"/> a re-index in the following situations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You have changed a custom field’s search template</li>
				<li>You have updated a third-party app that has made changes to a custom field that you are using</li>
				<li>You have made configuration changes that impact a custom field, such as its context</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Not performing a timely re-index could lead to incorrect search results being returned and other problems.</p>
			<p>To perform a re-index, you can either click on the <strong class="bold">perform a re-index</strong> link from the prompt or go to <strong class="bold">Jira administration console</strong> | <strong class="bold">System</strong> | <strong class="bold">Indexing</strong>. When performing a re-index, you can choose to either run a background re-index or a full (foreground) re-index. A background re-index is slower, but end users can continue to use Jira while the re-index process is taking place. A full re-index is faster, but Jira will be unavailable until the process is completed. In most cases, a background re-index is preferred, but in cases where the search index becomes corrupted, you will need to perform a full re-index. In these cases, you should plan for an outage as users will not be able to use Jira during re-indexing.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">You should select the background re-index option to avoid any downtime.</p>
			<p>We will discuss searching and indexing in more detail in <a href="B18644_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor292"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Searching, Reporting, </em><em class="italic">and Analysis</em>.</p>
			<p>You can also delete existing custom fields, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Custom </strong><strong class="bold">fields</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> option by clicking on the tools icon for the custom field you wish to delete.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button to delete the custom field.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once deleted, you cannot get the <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>custom field back, and you will not be able to retrieve and search the data held by that field. If you try to create another custom field of the same type and name, it will not inherit the data from the previous custom field, as Jira assigns unique identifiers to each of them. It is highly recommended to back up your Jira project before you delete the field unless you are absolutely certain you do not need it.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Configuring a custom field</h2>
			<p>Now that we have seen how to create and manage custom fields, we can start looking at more advanced configuration <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>options. Different custom field types will have different configuration options available to them. For example, while all custom fields will have the option to specify one or more contexts, selection list-based custom fields will also allow you to specify a list of options. We will look at each of the configuration options in the following sections.</p>
			<p>To configure a custom field, you need to access the <strong class="bold">Configure Custom Field</strong> page, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Custom </strong><strong class="bold">fields</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> option by clicking on the cog icon for the custom field you wish to configure from the list of custom fields. This will bring you to the <strong class="bold">Configure Custom </strong><strong class="bold">Field</strong> page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows that the <strong class="bold">Department</strong> custom field has two available contexts: the default configuration scheme, which is applied to <strong class="bold">Demonstration Project</strong>, and the <strong class="bold">PMO</strong> configuration scheme, which is applied only to the <strong class="bold">Development</strong> and <strong class="bold">Product </strong><strong class="bold">Management</strong> projects:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.7_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – Configure custom field&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.7 – Configure custom field</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Adding custom field contexts</h2>
			<p>From time to time, you may need your <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>custom fields to have different configurations, depending on what project the issue is located in. For example, if we have a select list custom field called <strong class="bold">Department</strong>, we may want it to have a different set of options based on which project the issue is being created in or even a different default value.</p>
			<p>To achieve this level of customization, Jira allows you to create multiple custom field contexts for a custom field. As we have seen already, a custom field context is a combination of issue types and projects. Therefore, in our preceding example, the default and <strong class="bold">PMO</strong> contexts have different options for the <strong class="bold">Department</strong> field.</p>
			<p>Creating a new custom field context is <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>simple. All you need to do is decide the issue type and project combination that will define the context:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Configure Custom Field</strong> page for the custom field you wish to create a new context for.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add new context</strong> link. This will take you to the <strong class="bold">Add configuration scheme</strong> context page.</li>
				<li>Enter a name in the new custom field context in the <strong class="bold">Configuration scheme </strong><strong class="bold">label</strong> field.</li>
				<li>Select the issue types for the new context under the <strong class="bold">Choose applicable issue </strong><strong class="bold">types</strong> section.</li>
				<li>Select projects for the new context under the <strong class="bold">Choose applicable </strong><strong class="bold">context</strong> section.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to create the new custom field context.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Each project can only belong to one custom field context per custom field (global context is not counted for this). Once you select a project for context, it will not be available the next time you create a new context. For example, if you create a new context for Project A, it will not be listed as an option when you create another context for the same custom field. This is to prevent you from accidentally creating two contexts for the same project.</p>
			<p>After a new custom field context has been created, it will not inherit any configuration values as the default context, such as the <strong class="bold">Default value</strong> and<strong class="bold"> Options</strong> from other contexts. You will need to repopulate and maintain the configuration options for each newly created context.</p>
			<p>Restricting custom field context can also help reduce search index size and help improve performance, especially with data center edition deployment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Configuring select options</h2>
			<p>For custom field types, such as select lists, checkboxes, radio buttons, and their multi-versions, you need to configure their select options before they can become useful to users. Select options are <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>configured and set on a per-custom-field-context basis. This provides the custom field with the flexibility of having different select options for different projects.</p>
			<p>To configure select options, you need to first select the custom field and then the context that the options will be applied to, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Custom </strong><strong class="bold">fields</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> option for the custom field you wish to configure the select options for.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit Options</strong> link for the custom field context you wish to apply the options to.</li>
				<li>Enter option values in the <strong class="bold">Add New Custom Field Option</strong> section, and click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to add the value. The options will be added in the order in which they are entered into the system. You can manually move option values up and down or click on <strong class="bold">Sort options alphabetically</strong> to let Jira perform the sorting for you.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> button once you finish configuring the select options:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.8_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8 – Configure field options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.8 – Configure field options</p>
			<p>You can delete and disable existing options. There is an important difference between the two operations. When you disable an option, Jira will simply not display that option for the field, but issues with <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>that option will still have its value, so when you re-enable the option, the values will be present. However, if you delete the option, it is deleted from Jira completely, including issues that have that option as their values for the field. For this reason, it is usually better to first disable an option and only delete it once you are sure it is no longer needed.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Setting default values</h2>
			<p>For most custom fields, you<a id="_idIndexMarker363"/> can set a default value so your users will not need to fill them in unless they have special needs. For text-based custom fields, the default values will be displayed as text by default, when the users create or edit an issue. For selection-based custom fields, the default values will be pre-selected options for users.</p>
			<p>Just like setting selection options, default options are also set on a per-custom-field-context basis:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Custom </strong><strong class="bold">fields</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> option for the custom field for which you wish to configure select options.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit Default Value</strong> link for the custom field context to which you want to apply the default values.</li>
				<li>Set the default value for the custom field.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Set Default</strong> button to set the default value.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Setting the default value will be different for different custom field types. For text-based custom fields, you will be able to type any text string. For select-based custom fields, you will be able to select from the options you add. For picker-based custom fields, such as <strong class="bold">User Picker</strong>, you will be able to select a user directly from the user base.</p>
			<p>When setting a default value for a<a id="_idIndexMarker364"/> field, there are some implications you need to be aware of. If a field has a default value, all issues created will have that value for the field unless explicitly overwritten by users. This could defeat the purpose if the same field is also set as mandatory, since it will always have a value. This can also cause problems when you want to run searches such as all issues that do not have a value for the field, so it is very important to consider whether the default value you are setting is meaningful for your use case.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Optimizing custom fields</h1>
			<p>Now that we <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>have seen how to create and manage custom fields, let’s revisit custom field context again. As we have seen, when you create a new custom field, Jira prompts you to set a context for it. However, this is a relatively new feature, and in older Jira versions, custom fields are created with a global context by default.</p>
			<p>As you add more and more custom fields to Jira, it is a good practice to check and optimize your custom field configurations, especially if you have been running your Jira instance since an older version, as most of your custom fields will likely be using the global context.</p>
			<p>To help you with that, Jira comes with a custom field optimizer. To run the optimizer, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Custom </strong><strong class="bold">fields</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Optimize</strong> link at the top right.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Scan</strong> button to run a new scan of your custom fields.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once the scan has been completed, Jira will provide a report on different ways you can better optimize your custom field configurations to help improve your overall Jira performance.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.9_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.9 – Optimize custom fields&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.9 – Optimize custom fields</p>
			<p>For example, in the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>screenshot, Jira has identified 10 custom fields that are using the global context, which would have an impact on Jira’s performance. By clicking on the <strong class="bold">Manage these custom fields</strong> link, Jira will list the 10 custom fields identified, and you can apply a context to each of the fields.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Field configuration</h1>
			<p>As you have already seen, fields are used to capture and display data in Jira. Fields can also have behaviors, which are defined by <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>field configuration. For each field in Jira, you can configure the behaviors listed here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Field description</strong>: This is the description<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> text that appears under the field when an issue is edited. With field configuration, you can have different description text for different projects and issue types.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Visibility</strong>: This determines whether a field should be visible or hidden.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Required</strong>: This specifies whether a field will be optional or required to have a value when an issue is being created/updated. When applied to select, checkbox, or radio button custom fields, this will remove the <strong class="bold">None</strong> option from the list.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rendering</strong>: This specifies<a id="_idIndexMarker369"/> how the content is to be displayed and what the field looks like when you are editing it. For example, a text-based field can have a default text editor, which will be a simple text-based editor, and a rich-text editor, which allows you to apply different styles to your text.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A field configuration provides<a id="_idIndexMarker370"/> you with control over each individual field in your Jira, including both system and custom fields. Since it is usually a good practice to reuse the same set of fields instead of creating new ones for every project, Jira allows you to create multiple field configurations, by means of which we can specify different configurations on the same set of fields and apply them to different projects.</p>
			<p>You can access the field configuration management page through the Jira administration console:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Field configurations</strong> option. This will bring you to the <strong class="bold">View Field </strong><strong class="bold">Configurations</strong> page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We will be looking at how to manage and apply multiple field configurations in later sections of this chapter. But first, let’s take a close look at how to create new field configurations and what we can do with them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Adding a field configuration</h2>
			<p>Creating new field <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>configurations is simple. All you need to do is specify the name and a short description for the new configuration:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">View Field </strong><strong class="bold">Configurations</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Field </strong><strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Enter the name and description for the new field configuration.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to create a field configuration.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It is always a good practice to adopt a naming convention for your configurations. As we will see later, in the <em class="italic">Field configuration scheme</em> section, field configurations are associated with issue types, so you can name your field configurations based on the project and/or issue type they will be applied to, for example, <code>Demonstration Project Bugs Field Configuration 1.0</code>. We also added a version number, so when you need to make changes to the field configuration, you can increment the version number, leaving a <a id="_idIndexMarker372"/>history of changes you can revert to.</p>
			<p>After a field configuration is created, it is not used until we associate it with a field configuration scheme. We will look at how to do this when we cover field configuration schemes. For now, let’s look at how to manage field behaviors in the field configuration.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Managing field configurations</h2>
			<p>Now that we have seen how to create new field configurations, it is time for us to take a closer look at the different <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>configuration options. Firstly, just a quick recap – each field configuration includes all the fields available in Jira, and its behavior is defined according to each field configuration. We will then associate it with a field configuration scheme, which will determine when a field configuration will become active for a given issue.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to access field configuration options:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">View Field </strong><strong class="bold">Configurations</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> link for the field configuration you wish to configure. This will take you to the <strong class="bold">View Field </strong><strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>On this page, all the fields and their current configuration options that are currently set for the selected field configuration are listed:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.10_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.10 – Manage field configurations&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.10 – Manage field configurations</p>
			<p>As you can see, there are several options you can configure for each field, and depending on the field type, the options may vary. While we will be looking at each of the options, it is important to note that some options will override each other. This is Jira trying to protect you from accidentally creating a configuration combination that will break your system. For example, if a field is set to both <strong class="bold">Hidden</strong> and <strong class="bold">Required</strong>, your users will not be able to<a id="_idIndexMarker374"/> create or edit issues, so Jira will not allow you to set a field to <strong class="bold">REQUIRED</strong> if you have already set it to <strong class="bold">Hidden</strong>. A common mistake is when you make a field <strong class="bold">Required</strong> but do not have it on the issue’s <strong class="bold">Create</strong> or <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> screens. When this happens, Jira will still require the user to enter a value for the field even though the field is not on a screen. So, it is important to double-check and make sure all your required fields are placed on the appropriate screens.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Field descriptions</h2>
			<p>While having a meaningful name for your fields will help your users understand what the fields are for, providing a short<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> description will provide more context and meaning. Field descriptions are displayed under the fields when you create or edit an issue. To add a description for a field, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">View Field Configuration</strong> page for the field configuration you wish to use.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> link for the field for which you wish to set a description.</li>
				<li>Add a description for the field and click on <strong class="bold">Update</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>For custom fields, the <a id="_idIndexMarker376"/>description you enter here will override the description you provided when you first created them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Required fields</h2>
			<p>You can set certain fields as <strong class="bold">Required</strong> or <strong class="bold">Mandatory</strong> for certain issues. This is a very useful feature as it ensures that critical information can be captured when users create issues. For example, for our <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>support system, it makes sense to have our users enter the system that is misbehaving into a field and make that field compulsory to help our support engineers.</p>
			<p>You have already seen required fields in action. System fields, such as <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> and <strong class="bold">Issue Type</strong>, are compulsory in Jira (and you cannot change that). When you do not specify a value for a required field, Jira will display an error message underneath the field, telling you that the value is required.</p>
			<p>When you add a new field into Jira, such as a custom field, it is optional by default, meaning users do not need to specify a value. You can then change the setting to make those fields required:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">View Field Configuration</strong> page for the field configuration you wish to use.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">REQUIRED</strong>/<strong class="bold">Optional</strong> link for the field you wish to set as the mandatory requirement.</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.11_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.11 –  Required/optional field&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.11 –  Required/optional field</p>
			<p>You will notice that once a field is set to <strong class="bold">REQUIRED</strong>, there will be a small <strong class="bold">Required Text</strong> label in red next to the field name. When you create or edit an issue, the field will have a red (*) character <a id="_idIndexMarker378"/>next to its name. This is Jira’s way of indicating that a field is mandatory.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Field visibility</h2>
			<p>Most fields in Jira can be hidden from a user’s view. When a field is set to <strong class="bold">Hidden</strong>, users will not see the field on any screens, including issues such as create, update, and view. Perform the following steps<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> in order to show or hide a field:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">View Field Configuration</strong> page for the field configuration you wish to use.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Show</strong>/<strong class="bold">Hide</strong> link for the field you wish to show or hide, respectively.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once a field has been set to <strong class="bold">Hidden</strong>, it will not appear onscreen and you will not be able to search in it. However, you can still use tools such as scripts to set values for hidden fields. For this reason, hidden fields are used to store data that is used by automated processes.</p>
			<p>Not all fields can be hidden. System fields, such as <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> and <strong class="bold">Issue Type</strong>, cannot be hidden. When you set a field to <strong class="bold">Hidden</strong>, you will notice that you can no longer set the field as <strong class="bold">Required</strong>. As stated earlier, setting a field to <strong class="bold">Required</strong> will make Jira enforce a value to be entered into the field when you create or edit an issue. If the field is hidden, there will be no way for you to set a value and you will be stuck. This is why Jira will automatically disable the <strong class="bold">Required</strong> option, especially if you have already hidden a field. On the other hand, if you marked a field as <strong class="bold">Required</strong>, when you hide the same field, you would notice that the field is no longer required. The rule of thumb is that field visibility will override required fields.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">A field cannot be both hidden and required.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Field rendering</h2>
			<p>Renderers control how a field will be displayed when it is viewed or edited. Some system and custom fields have more than one renderer, and for these fields, you can choose which one to use. For example, for text-based fields, such as <strong class="bold">Description</strong>, you can choose to use the simple text renderer or the more sophisticated wiki-style renderer, which will allow you to use wiki markup to add more styling.</p>
			<p>Jira ships with four different renderers:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Default text renderer</strong>: This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker380"/>default renderer for text-based fields. Contents <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>are rendered as plain text. If the text resolves a Jira issue key, the renderer will automatically turn that into an HTML link.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Wiki-style renderer</strong>: This is an <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>enhanced renderer for text-based fields. It allows you to use wiki markup to decorate your text content.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Select list renderer</strong>: This is the default<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> renderer for selection-based fields. It is rendered as a standard HTML select list.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Autocomplete renderer</strong>: This is an<a id="_idIndexMarker384"/> enhanced renderer for selection-based fields, and it provides an autocomplete feature to assist users as they start typing into the fields.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The following table lists all the fields that can have special renderers configured and their available options:</p>
			<div><div><table id="table004-1" class="No-Table-Style">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 5.4 – Field renderers</p>
			<p>Perform the following<a id="_idIndexMarker385"/> steps to set the renderer for a field:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse the <strong class="bold">View Field Configuration</strong> page for the field configuration you wish to use.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Renderer</strong> link for the field you wish to set a renderer for (if it is available). You will be taken to the <strong class="bold">Edit Field </strong><strong class="bold">Renderer</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Select the renderer from the available drop-down list.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Update</strong> button to set the renderer.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>There are other custom renderers developed by third-party vendors. Just like custom fields, these are packaged as add-ons that you can install in Jira. Once installed, these custom renderers will be available for the selection of the appropriate field types.</p>
			<p>A good example is the <code>JEditor</code> add-on, which provides an advanced rich-text editor for all text-based fields including <strong class="bold">Description</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Field configuration scheme</h1>
			<p>With multiple field configurations, Jira determines when to apply each of the configurations through the field configuration scheme. A <strong class="bold">field configuration scheme</strong> maps field configurations to issue types. This scheme can then be associated with one or more projects.</p>
			<p>This allows you to group <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>multiple field configurations mapped to issue types and apply them to a project in one go. The project will then be able to determine which field configuration to apply, based on the nature of the issue. For example, for a given project, you can have different field configurations for bugs and tasks.</p>
			<p>This grouping of configurations into schemes also provides you with the option to reuse existing configurations without duplicating work, as each scheme can be reused and associated with multiple projects.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Managing field configuration schemes</h2>
			<p>You can manage all your<a id="_idIndexMarker387"/> field configuration schemes from the <strong class="bold">View Field Configuration </strong><strong class="bold">Schemes</strong> page:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Field Configuration Schemes</strong> option. This will bring you to the <strong class="bold">View Field Configuration </strong><strong class="bold">Schemes</strong> page:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.12_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.12 – Manage field configuration schemes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.12 – Manage field configuration schemes</p>
			<p>This is the main <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>page where you can add, configure, edit, delete, and copy field configuration schemes. We will start by looking at how to add a new field configuration scheme next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Adding a field configuration scheme</h2>
			<p>The first step in grouping your field configurations is to create a new field configuration scheme. By default, Jira does not come with any field configuration schemes. All the projects will use the system<a id="_idIndexMarker389"/> default field configuration. The new field configuration scheme will hold all the mappings between our field configurations and issue types.</p>
			<p>To create a new field configuration scheme, all you need to do is specify the name and an optional description for the scheme:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">View Field Configuration </strong><strong class="bold">Schemes</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Field Configuration </strong><strong class="bold">Scheme</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Enter a name and description for the new field configuration scheme.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to create the scheme.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Since field configuration schemes are applied to projects, it is good practice to name them according to the projects. For example, the scheme for the sales project can be named <code>Sales Field Configuration Scheme</code>. You can add a version number after the name to help you maintain changes.</p>
			<p>Once the new field configuration scheme is created, it will be displayed in the table that lists all the existing schemes. At this<a id="_idIndexMarker390"/> time, the scheme is not yet useful as it does not contain any configuration mappings and is associated with a project.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Configuring a field configuration scheme</h2>
			<p>Once you have a new field configuration scheme set up, you will be able to add mapping between field configurations <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>and issue types. For each field configuration scheme, one issue type can be mapped to only one field configuration, while each field configuration can be mapped to multiple issue types. The following screenshot shows that the issue types <strong class="bold">Sub-task</strong>, <strong class="bold">Epic</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Task</strong> all have specific field configurations applied and that <strong class="bold">Default Field Configuration</strong> will be applied to all other issue types that are not explicitly mapped, such as <strong class="bold">Bug</strong> or <strong class="bold">Story</strong>:</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.13 – Configure field configuration scheme</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">One issue type can only be mapped to one field configuration.</p>
			<p>When a field configuration scheme is first created, Jira creates a default mapping, which maps all unmapped issue types to the default field configuration. You cannot delete this default mapping as it acts as a catch-all condition for mappings that you do not specify in your scheme. What you need to do is add more specific mappings that will take precedence over this default mapping:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">View Field Configuration </strong><strong class="bold">Schemes</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Configure</strong> link for the field configuration scheme you wish to configure.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Associate an Issue Type with a Field </strong><strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Select the issue type and field configuration from the dialog.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to add the mapping.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can repeat these steps to add <a id="_idIndexMarker392"/>more mapping for other issue types. All unmapped issue types will use the <strong class="bold">Default</strong> mapping.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Associating a field configuration scheme with a project</h2>
			<p>After you create a new field <a id="_idIndexMarker393"/>configuration scheme and establish the mappings, the final step is to associate the scheme with a project for the configurations to take effect.</p>
			<p>It is important to note that, once you associate the field configuration scheme with a project, you cannot delete it until you remove all the associations so that the scheme becomes inactive again.</p>
			<p>To associate a field configuration scheme with a project, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the target project’s administration page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Fields</strong> option in the left panel.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Use a different scheme</strong> option from the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu.</li>
				<li>Select a new field configuration scheme and click on the <strong class="bold">Associate</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As shown in the following screenshot, the project is using <strong class="bold">PMO Field Configuration Scheme</strong>, which has four configurations. Three are mapped to specific issue types, and <strong class="bold">Default Field Configuration</strong> is applied to any issue types without an explicit mapping.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.14_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.14 – Associate field configuration scheme&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.14 – Associate field configuration scheme</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">You can click on each of the field <a id="_idIndexMarker394"/>configurations to view their details.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Screens</h1>
			<p>In order for a field to be displayed <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>when you view, create, or edit an issue, it needs to be placed on a screen. You have already seen this when creating new custom fields. One of the steps in the creation process is to select what screens to add the custom field to. Screens will be discussed further in <a href="B18644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Screen Management</em>, so we will not spend too much time understanding them right now.</p>
			<p>What you need to know for now is that after a field has been added to a screen, you can add it to additional screens or remove it completely. If you are working with just one field, you can configure it here from the field configurations. If you have multiple fields to update, a better approach will be to work directly with screens, as we will see in <a href="B18644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Screen Management</em>.</p>
			<p>There is a subtle difference between hiding a field in field configuration and not placing a field on a screen. While the end result will be similar where, in both cases, the field will not show up, if you hide a field, you can still set a value for it through the use of default value, workflow post-functions (covered in <a href="B18644_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Workflow and Business Process</em>), or custom scripts, essentially meaning that the field is there but just hidden. However, if the field is not on the<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> screen, you cannot set its value. Another difference is that hiding a field will hide it for all screens that have the field added, for projects using the field configuration.</p>
			<p>Now that you have seen how to manage fields in Jira, it is time to expand our HR project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>The HR project</h1>
			<p>What we will do this time is add a few new custom fields to help capture some additional useful information. We will also create a customized field configuration specially designed for our HR team. Lastly, we will tie everything together by associating our fields, configurations, and projects through field configuration schemes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Setting up a custom field</h2>
			<p>Since you are implementing a project for HR, and we have created two issue types in the last chapter, <strong class="bold">New Employee</strong> and <strong class="bold">Termination</strong>, for the <strong class="bold">New Employee</strong> issue type, we will add a new custom field called <strong class="bold">Direct Manager</strong>, so when everything is completed, the manager <a id="_idIndexMarker397"/>can be notified that their new team member is ready to start. Since the manager is already in the organization, we will be using a <strong class="bold">User Picker</strong> field, so Jira will be able to automatically look up the user for us.</p>
			<p>For our <strong class="bold">Termination</strong> issue type, we will also add a new custom field called <strong class="bold">Last Day</strong>, so we know when it will be the last day for the employee. For this field, we will use a date picker, so we can keep the date format consistent.</p>
			<p>To create these custom fields, execute the following tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Custom </strong><strong class="bold">fields</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Custom </strong><strong class="bold">Field</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">User Picker</strong> custom field type.</li>
				<li>Name the custom field <code>Direct Manager</code> and click on <strong class="bold">Create</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select all issue types and the HR project as the context for our new custom field.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">HR: Task Management Create Issue Screen</strong> and <strong class="bold">HR: Task Management Edit/View Issue Screen</strong> from the list of screens, and click on <strong class="bold">Update</strong>.</li>
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">steps 2 to 5</em>, but <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>select the <code>Last Day</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Setting up the field configuration</h2>
			<p>Now that we have our custom fields ready, the <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>next step is to create a new field configuration so that we can specify the behaviors of our custom fields. What we will do here is set both new custom fields as <strong class="bold">Required</strong>, so when the issues are entered in Jira, users will have to enter a value for them. But the <strong class="bold">Direct Manager</strong> field should only be required when creating a <strong class="bold">New Employee</strong> issue, and not <strong class="bold">Termination</strong>. To do this, we need to create two field configurations:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">View Field </strong><strong class="bold">Configurations</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Field </strong><strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Name the new field configuration <code>New Employee </code><code>Field Configuration</code>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to create a new field configuration. Now that we have our new field configuration, we can start adding configurations to our new custom fields.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Required</strong> link for the <strong class="bold">Direct Manager</strong> custom field.</li>
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">steps 2 to 5</em> to create a new field configuration called <strong class="bold">Termination Field Configuration</strong>, and<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> make the <strong class="bold">Last Day</strong> field mandatory.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Setting up a field configuration scheme</h2>
			<p>We have our custom fields, and have<a id="_idIndexMarker401"/> configured the relevant options, created a new field configuration, and set the behavior of our fields. Now it is time to add them to a scheme:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">View Field Configuration </strong><strong class="bold">Schemes</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Field Configuration </strong><strong class="bold">Scheme</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Name the new field configuration scheme <code>HR Field Configuration Scheme</code>, as we will be applying this to our HR project.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to create a new field configuration scheme.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>With the field configuration scheme created, we can associate the field configurations with their appropriate issue types, <strong class="bold">New Employee</strong> and <strong class="bold">Termination</strong>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Associate an Issue Type with a Field </strong><strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Set the issue type as <strong class="bold">New Employee</strong> and the field configuration as <strong class="bold">New Employee </strong><strong class="bold">Field Configuration</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to add the association.</li>
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">steps 1 to 3</em> for the <strong class="bold">Termination</strong> issue type and <strong class="bold">Termination </strong><strong class="bold">Field Configuration</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Putting it together</h2>
			<p>OK, so we have done all the hard work. We created new custom fields, a new field configuration, and a new field configuration scheme; the final step is to put everything together and see it in action:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Project Administration</strong> page for our HR project.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Fields</strong> link on the left-hand side and the <strong class="bold">Use a different scheme</strong> option from the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">HR Field Configuration Scheme</strong> and click on the <strong class="bold">Associate</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Alright, we are all done! You can pat yourself on <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>the back, sit back, and take a look at your work in action.</p>
			<p>Create a new issue of the <strong class="bold">Termination</strong> type in the HR project, and you will see your new custom fields at the bottom of the page. As shown in the following screenshot, both the <strong class="bold">Direct Manager</strong> and <strong class="bold">Last Day</strong> fields are mandatory and an error message is displayed if we do not provide values for them.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.15_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 5.15 – Create a Termination issue&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.15 – Create a Termination issue</p>
			<p>We see the <strong class="bold">Direct Manager</strong> custom field here<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> because both <strong class="bold">New Employee</strong> and <strong class="bold">Termination</strong> issue types use the same set of screens. We will look at how to use separate screens in <a href="B18644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>. We can, however, also use field configuration to hide the field for the appropriate issue type.</p>
			<p>Go ahead and create a new <strong class="bold">Termination</strong> issue by filling in the fields. On the <strong class="bold">View Issue</strong> page, you will see your new custom fields displayed, along with the values you provide:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.16_B18644.jpg" alt="Table 5.16 – View termination issue&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 5.16 – View termination issue</p>
			<p>As we can see, by adding our <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>own custom fields in Jira, we are able to customize our intake form (create issue screen) to capture additional data than the out-of-the-box system fields, and we can also make certain fields required to ensure users will always fill them in.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at fields in Jira. We also looked at how Jira is able to extend its ability to capture user data through custom fields, and at applying searchers to these fields to make the data they capture searchable. We explored how we can specify different behavior for fields under different contexts through the use of field configurations and schemes. We also briefly introduced screens, which we will delve deeper into in the next chapter. Lastly, we put all these together by adding new custom fields to our HR project.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will expand on what we learned about fields by formally introducing you to screens, and will show you how combining fields and screens provides users with the most natural and logical forms to assist them with creating and logging issues.</p>
