		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>The aim of this book is to give you the knowledge and the broad set of tools needed to build cloud-native applications using Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a powerful technology that gives engineers powerful tools to build cloud-native platforms using containers. The project itself is constantly evolving and contains many different tools to tackle common scenarios.</p>
			<p>For the layout of this book, rather than sticking to any one niche area of the Kubernetes toolset, we will first give you a thorough summary of the most important parts of default Kubernetes functionality – giving you all the skills you need in order to run applications on Kubernetes. Then, we'll give you the tools you need in order to deal with security and troubleshooting for Kubernetes in a day 2 scenario. Finally, we'll go past the boundaries of Kubernetes itself and look at some powerful patterns and technologies to build on top of Kubernetes – such as service meshes and serverless.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for beginners to Kubernetes, but you should be well acquainted with containers and DevOps principles in order to get the most out of this book.  A solid grounding in Linux will help but is not completely necessary.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Since Kubernetes is based on containers, some examples in this book may use containers that have changed since publishing. Other illustrative examples may use containers that do not publicly exist in Docker Hub. These examples should be used as a basis for running your own application containers.</p>

			<p>In some cases, open source software like Kubernetes can have breaking changes. The book is up to date with Kubernetes 1.19, but always check the documentation (for Kubernetes and for any of the other open source projects covered in the book) for the most up-to-date information and specifications.</p>
