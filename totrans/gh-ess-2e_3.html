<p class="calibre3">In <a target="_blank" href="part0044.html#19UOO0-184576c1044a4350bd24f18b869c0732" class="calibre10">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre14">Using the Wiki and Managing Code Versioning</em>, we explored how you can accompany your project with documentation using the built-in wiki that GitHub provides, and we saw how to manage your code versions with GitHub releases.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It is important to know when to host a project under your namespace and when under an organization. With the organization, you have the ability to create teams and provide different access levels to people in the various repositories that are hosted under it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will go through creating an organization, inviting people, and granting them access to the repositories that are hosted under the organization. You will learn how to create teams and associate members of your organization to them as well as with the repositories.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We will cover the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">The difference between users and organizations</li>
<li class="calibre12">Organization roles and repository permission levels</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">The difference between users and organizations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Apart from your user account that should be used only by yourself, GitHub provides the ability to create organizations managed by many users and, as we will see later, create teams within the organization.</p>
<p class="calibre3">GitHub is a collaborative place and as such, projects with high contribution traffic need a handful of people to help with the maintenance.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This might not be the only reason why one should create an organization, though. Leaving aside the practical reasons, an organization is usually created when there is more than one person, each having equal rights to the projects that the organization will host.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can see, for example, big names such as Twitter, Google, or even GitHub itself that have organizations under which dozens of projects are hosted.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Organization roles and repository permission levels</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">GitHub allows you to choose among three roles for a person in an organization: owners, members, and billing managers. We will not deal with the latter; if you want more information on this, refer to <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization/" class="calibre10">https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-billing-manager-to-your-organization/</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Owners have full access to the organization and are in the highest level of the permissions chain. As far as the organization is concerned, they can invite and remove people, create and remove teams, create and remove repositories, as well as manage the permission levels of all people and repositories. They can also edit the organization settings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Being a member is usually the default role when a new person gets in the organization. The least a member can do is create a new team and add existing team members and repositories to it.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">The access level a member has over a repository can only be set by an owner.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">A member can also be promoted to "Maintainer" for a particular team. With this access level, they can add and remove team members. Consider it like an extra hidden role on top of being a member. Anyone who creates a new team is granted the "Maintainer" role for that team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now, be careful not to mix organization permissions with repository permissions. There are four kinds of permissions that a repository can have: owner, admin, write, and read.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Owner is the top universal permission level that is granted to organization owners. With Admin access, one has owner privileges, but for the particular repository; you can push to it, delete it, add or remove a team, change the team's permission level, add outside collaborators, and so on. It is like creating a new repository under your personal namespace. With Write access, you can push to the repository; Read grants you read permission, which means clone and pull only.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For a comprehensive list of the various level permissions, check out GitHub's documentation at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/" class="calibre10">https://help.github.com/articles/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization/</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we have discussed the different access levels and permissions, let's create our first organization.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating an organization</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In order to create an organization, find the cross button at the top header next to your avatar or visit <a href="https://github.com/organizations/new" class="calibre10">https://github.com/organizations/new</a> directly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the next screen, pick up an organization name and fill in a billing e-mail. For testing purposes, you can give your personal e-mail, which you can change later if you want. For open source projects, the creation of an organization is free, which is the default plan. If the organization will be owned by a business, you'll have to accept the corporate terms of service. All these options are summarized in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00056.jpeg" class="calibre66"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As you type the name, GitHub searches behind the scenes if it is already taken, and if that is the case, a message appears saying that Username is already taken.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">As you will notice, there cannot be a user and an organization with the same name. Namespaces must be unique.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">In the next step, you can optionally invite some people to be part of the organization. Search them by their username, full name or email, and then select them and click <strong class="calibre5">Invite</strong> to invite them to your organization. When done, hit Finish:</p>
<div><img src="img/00057.jpeg" class="calibre67"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">The first thing you will see after the creation is your organization's dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00058.jpeg" class="calibre68"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Before we dive into teams, people, and repositories, let's first check out some defaults by setting member privileges globally in the organization settings.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Global member privileges</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Prior to inviting people and creating any repositories, let's examine two important settings and set some defaults. Head over to the <strong class="calibre5">Settings</strong> page and select the Member privileges tab:</p>
<div><img src="img/00059.jpeg" class="calibre69"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As you can see, there are various settings regarding the repositories. The first is about repository creation, and if enabled, any member of the organization will be able to create repositories under the organization namespace.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Enable this if you want to work more openly and disable it to be more strict. By disabling it, only owners will be able to create repositories. Outside collaborators (see the <em class="calibre14">Difference between Members and Outside collaborators</em> section) will not be able to create any repositories regardless of this option.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next two options are for members with admin permissions on repositories. You can enable or disable the repository deletion and their visibility status to allow them to perform those actions on the repositories they have admin privileges on.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next option is regarding the forking behavior of any private repository inside the organization. By default, it's disabled and members of the organization will not be able to fork private repositories.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The last option is regarding the default repository permissions that organization members have on all repositories, new or old. You can choose from four options: Admin, Write, Read, and None. The None option is the least privileged one and it means that members can only clone and pull public repositories. With Read access, a member can clone and pull every repository, public or private. Write access means that apart from read access, members can also push to the repositories. Lastly, Admin access will give every member the ability to pull and push to a repository as well as change its settings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Throughout the rest of the chapter, the examples will be based on members being able to create repositories, and the default repository permission level will be Read unless otherwise noted.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We will explore the rest of the settings later in this chapter.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Repositories</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">So, the first tab on your new dashboard is Repositories, and since there is none at that time, GitHub urges you to create one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you hit the <strong class="calibre5">Create a new repository</strong> button, you will be taken to a familiar page. If you read <a target="_blank" href="part0020.html#J2B80-184576c1044a4350bd24f18b869c0732" class="calibre10">Chapter 1</a>, <em class="calibre14">Brief Repository Overview and Usage of the Issue Tracker</em>, you will notice that the only thing that changes when creating a repository is the namespace. If I wanted, I could have created the repository under my username by choosing it from the drop-down menu.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After you fill in the information and the repository is created, you can upload the code from your computer and start working on it. You might have noticed in the repository's landing page when it was first created, that GitHub has a message to add teams and collaborators:</p>
<div><img src="img/00060.jpeg" class="calibre70"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">If you want to grant access to certain people immediately, then you should follow that route. For our purposes, given that this is a new organization, we must first learn about teams and their differences with outside collaborators as well as the different permissions on repositories.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Teams – a great way to grant selective access to your organization projects</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">A team is how you control different access levels in your repositories. Next, we will see how to create a team and add members to it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating a team</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As with most cases in GitHub, you can create a team in different ways. The apparent way is to head over to the Teams tab and create a new team by clicking the New team button:</p>
<div><img src="img/00061.jpeg" class="calibre71"/></div>
<p>Another way to create a team is to head over to the Settings of an organization repository, and under the Collaborators and teams tab, hit the Create new team button. Notice that only a repository that lives under an organization namespace will have the Teams option. If you edit a personal project, you can only see the Collaborators box.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When you first create a new team, you will be presented with the following form:</p>
<div><img src="img/00062.jpeg" class="calibre72"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">The team name is mandatory and the action is two-fold. You can enter a human-readable text with punctuation and capitalization, but notice that the name that will appear in the URL is converted to lowercase. For example, <kbd class="calibre13">GitHub Core</kbd> will be <kbd class="calibre13">github-core</kbd>. Any special character is stripped and converted to a dash (<kbd class="calibre13">-</kbd>).</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can put an optional description and then choose whether this team will be publicly visible or secret. A secret team will only be visible by its members and the owners.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since GitHub supports nested teams, you are also presented with the option to choose the parent team that this team should be a child of. In case this is the very first team you create, there will be no parent, so this option will not be available.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After the team is created, you will be taken to the team's page where you can see who the team members are and what repositories this team has access to. You will be able to start a discussion with the members of that team and also edit the team's settings, such as change its name or even delete it:</p>
<div><img src="img/00063.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Inviting people</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The whole point of having teams is to have people in them. So far, you were the only member of the organization; let's invite someone to join the team.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">You can only invite people that are already registered GitHub users.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">Head over to the Teams tab and select the team you want to invite someone to. Go to the <strong class="calibre5">Members</strong> tab and hit Add a member. Start typing the username and GitHub will sort out until it finds the right one:</p>
<div><img src="img/00064.jpeg" class="calibre73"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After you select the person, you can see that GitHub will tell you that there's one pending invitation. If you click on the 1 pending invitation link, a modal will be revealed where you can edit the invitation:</p>
<div><img src="img/00065.jpeg" class="calibre74"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">By default, the role one has when invited to a team is Member. If you want to change this to Owner, you can edit the invitation, change the role, and optionally assign different teams. You can cancel the invitation as well:</p>
<div><img src="img/00066.jpeg" class="calibre75"/></div>
<div><p class="calibre19">Only owners can invite new people to a team or the organization. A person has to be an organization member, for team maintainers to be able to add them to teams.</p>
</div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Accepting an invitation</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">GitHub will send out an email notifying the invited person about the invitation. In it, there is a link to follow that lands you to the organization page where you can accept the invitation or you can just ignore the email and visit the organization page directly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here I visited the organization's page as the person who got invited and as you can see I am presented with a message to join the organization:</p>
<div><img src="img/00067.jpeg" class="calibre76"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Either way, the final page where you will decide whether you will be joining the organization is as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/00068.jpeg" class="calibre77"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Let's accept the invitation and start working as part of the organization. After accepting, you will be able to see who the people are, the repositories, and the teams you have access to.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Team member permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As a maintainer of the team, when you visit the <strong class="calibre5">Members</strong> tab of your team's page, you can change a member's team access. Check the checkbox of one or more team members to change their membership. Once done, you'll notice that a dropdown appears. From there, you can either remove the selected members from the team or change their role. Let's click on the <strong class="calibre5">Change role</strong> link and change the role to Maintainer:</p>
<div><img src="img/00069.jpeg" class="calibre78"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After you promote a member to maintainer, they will have more privileges, and the Maintainer label will be added next to their username:</p>
<div><img src="img/00070.jpeg" class="calibre79"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">A maintainer can now add or remove team members, edit the team's settings, and even delete it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Requesting to join a team</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">There may be occasions where a member wants to get in another team that has more privileges on a repository. If you are already a member of an organization, you can ask a member to join an existing team. Let's break it down in steps and see how this is done.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Step one – as a user</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Head over to the team you want access to, select the Members tab, and you will notice a Request to join button in the teams you are not a member of yet. Click on it and wait for your request to be reviewed by an administrator.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you request to join the team, an owner or a team maintainer will have to accept your request. If you now visit again the Members page of the team, you can see the Cancel pending request button. This way you know that your request has not yet been approved, and as you might have guessed, you can cancel it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Step two – as an owner or team maintainer</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">By the time you request to join a team, an email notifies the owners and team maintainers about your request to join that team. As an owner or team maintainer, by visiting the Members tab of the team in question, you can see that there is a pending request:</p>
<div><img src="img/00071.jpeg" class="calibre80"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Click on it and accept or reject the request:</p>
<div><img src="img/00072.jpeg" class="calibre81"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Adding repositories to a team</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Assuming there's one or more repositories created under the organization, it's now time to add a repository to a team and explore the privileges of a team upon it. Remember that only owners can perform this action for all teams and team maintainers only for the team that they are maintainers of.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There are two ways to pair a team with a repository and vice versa. The first way is to search for a repository within a team and the second way is to search for a team within a repository.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let's try the first one. Head over to the team that you want to add repositories to, and at the Repositories tab click the Add repository button and start typing the name of the repository to add:</p>
<div><img src="img/00073.jpeg" class="calibre82"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As you can see, the default access to this repository is Read. This is the default access level that we have set in the <em class="calibre14">Global member privileges</em> section. Regardless of the global option, you can set different permissions on each repository that the team has access to:</p>
<div><img src="img/00074.jpeg" class="calibre83"/></div>
<div><p class="calibre19">Team members cannot change the repository access level, but can remove the repository from a team.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">Now, if you head over to the repository's settings under the Collaborators &amp; teams tab, you can see the team that is added:</p>
<div><img src="img/00075.jpeg" class="calibre84"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Team discussions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Much like adding comments to an issue, members of a team can discuss things that may not be suitable to an issue itself. You can start a discussion under a team's landing page:</p>
<div><img src="img/00076.jpeg" class="calibre85"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">When starting a new discussion you can choose it to be visible to the whole organization or just to the team members.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">The People tab</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The People tab is where, as an owner, you can manage the organization members' privileges:</p>
<div><img src="img/00077.jpeg" class="calibre86"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">From the previous screenshot, you can see that, as an owner, you have a higher overview of the members in your organization. Let's examine what all of these settings mean.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The 2FA mark simply means that a member has not enabled Two-factor authentication. From a security perspective, you would want every member of the organization to have enabled 2FA to prevent a potential account compromise that would lead to gaining access to the organization's repositories.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The next thing is the visibility of the organization membership. Each user must set the visibility for themselves. Set it to Private to hide your membership and choose Public to publicize it. If you publicize it, the organization's avatar will show in your profile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Next, you can see how many teams each member is part of. Clicking on the number will show you the exact teams.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Lastly, there's the organization roles. Only owners have the ability to change a member's organization role and you can set it to either Member or Owner via the Change role... link:<strong class="calibre5"><br class="calibre7"/></strong></p>
<div><img src="img/00078.jpeg" class="calibre87"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">The Manage button takes you to an individual's management page. Let's take a good look at it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Managing access levels</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Selecting Manage access will take you to a person's management page:</p>
<div><img src="img/00079.jpeg" class="calibre88"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">On the left-hand side box, you can see the same information as shown in the People dashboard. From here, you can change the member's role, even remove them from the organization, purging every permission they might have on the organization's repositories. The outside collaborator option will be covered in the next section.</p>
<p class="calibre3">On the right-hand side, you can see all the repositories they have access to and can manage their access level to every single one of them. Let's explore this setting by hitting the Manage access button:</p>
<div><img src="img/00080.jpeg" class="calibre89"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">According to what you have set in the global settings access, as we saw in the <em class="calibre14">Global member privileges</em> section, you can see the access level in the particular repository. The access levels are also taken from the specific privileges a team has on a repository, as explored in the <em class="calibre14">Adding repositories to a team</em> section, which can override the global defaults.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let's make a test and set the global setting to Write and see what happens. Click on the Edit button of the Membership privilege setting under the Read box. Then, change Default repository permission to Write, accepting GitHub's prompt, and go back to the previous page to see how it changed:</p>
<div><img src="img/00081.jpeg" class="calibre90"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Even if the person was not a member of the team that would grant them write access, they would still have the Write access to the repository since this is now the global default. Also, notice how Remove write access is grayed out. Since the global default and the access that the team grants are the same (Write), there is no point of demoting a member's access level.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Similarly, the Remove access to this repository button on the top-right is grayed out. What this does is remove the access completely, which means in order to see this button enabled, you must have set the global repository access permission to None. Let's give it a go, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00082.jpeg" class="calibre91"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Removing the access to this repository is going to remove that person from the team that granted them access in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre3">That's all there is to it when it comes to managing a member's access to a repository. Let's go ahead and finally see what these Outside collaborators are all about.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Difference between Members and Outside collaborators</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As the name suggests, outside collaborators are non-organization members with repository access. Much like you can give write access to another user in your personal repository, you can give them write access to individual organizational repositories without being members.</p>
<p class="calibre3">At present, no one outside our organization has access to a repository. If you visit Outside collaborators under the <strong class="calibre5">People</strong> tab, GitHub will tell you that there are no collaborators yet:</p>
<div><img src="img/00083.jpeg" class="calibre92"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Let's add an outside collaborator by going to a repository's <strong class="calibre5">Settings</strong> in the Collaborators &amp; teams tab:</p>
<div><img src="img/00084.jpeg" class="calibre93"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After selecting the user, hit the Add collaborator button:</p>
<div><img src="img/00085.jpeg" class="calibre94"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Notice that the default access level is Write and not Read, which is set globally for the repositories. The default repository permission only applies to organization members, not to outside collaborators.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once the user has accepted the invitation, you can head over to the organization's People page and select Outside collaborators. From this page, you can manage a collaborator's access and even invite them to the organization. Click on the wheel button and select <strong class="calibre5">Manage</strong> to manage their access:</p>
<div><img src="img/00086.jpeg" class="calibre95"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">This particular user has Write access to one repository, and we can see that this is an outside collaborator. By going to Manage access, you can remove the user's write access to the repository or remove their access altogether:</p>
<div><img src="img/00087.jpeg" class="calibre96"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Demoting to an outside collaborator</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Just as you can be promoted to a member if invited, you can also be demoted. Under the People tab click on a user's username to manage their access:</p>
<div><img src="img/00088.jpeg" class="calibre97"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">When converted to an outside collaborator, any repository access level that was given to this person in a team will be retained.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Organization settings</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">So far, we have only explored the Member privileges setting. Let's see the rest of them by heading over to the <strong class="calibre5">Settings</strong> page of an organization.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Profile</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">From the profile page, you can change the organization's name and its description, add a URL and a profile picture, rename the organization namespace, and even delete it:</p>
<div><img src="img/00089.jpeg" class="calibre98"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After making all of these changes, you can see that the landing page of your organization will be a little bit prettier:</p>
<div><img src="img/00090.jpeg" class="calibre99"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Security</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Under the <strong class="calibre5">Security</strong> tab you can require all the member of the organization to enable two-factor authentication for maximizing security.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Audit log</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you have ever worked in a Unix environment, you should know that almost everything that is done in the system gets logged somewhere (usually under <kbd class="calibre13">/var/log/</kbd>). In the same way, GitHub logs most actions in what it calls an audit log.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While I was performing all the team creation, membership, and repositories examples, I got quite a big audit log:</p>
<div><img src="img/00091.jpeg" class="calibre100"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You can see what user made what action and the time this was performed. To better explore the log, GitHub provides the option to extract it in CSV or JSON format. You can even use the search function to filter specific events.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Third-party access</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Third-party access is an advanced setting. Some applications and many web apps have a way to interact with GitHub and gather information about repositories, teams, user data, and so on. This is accomplished by the feature rich API that GitHub provides.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By default, this is set to be restricted. This means that if as a user you authorize an application, for example, to read all your repositories, it will not have access to the organization ones.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For more information, you can read GitHub's documentation at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-oauth-app-access-restrictions/" class="calibre10">https://help.github.com/articles/about-oauth-app-access-restrictions/</a>.</p>

<p class="calibre3">Under the <strong class="calibre5">Teams</strong> tab you can globally enable or disable the team discussions.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Tips and tricks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Here are some tips and tricks that complement what you have learned so far.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">How to transfer a repository to an organization's namespace</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">There will be times where a repository of yours fits better under the umbrella of an organization. In this case, you can transfer it under the organization's namespace. You are able to transfer repositories to organizations only if you are at least their member.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Head over to your project's <strong class="calibre5">Settings</strong> and in the "Danger Zone" area you will see a Transfer button:</p>
<div><img src="img/00092.jpeg" class="calibre101"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">A modal will appear where you have to confirm by providing the repository's name and the organization that you wish this to be transferred to:</p>
<div><img src="img/00093.jpeg" class="calibre102"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">If you are a member of the organization, in the next step, you get to choose if you want any other teams to have access to this repository:</p>
<div><img src="img/00094.jpeg" class="calibre103"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Once ready, hit Transfer. GitHub will notify you that the transfer might take a few minutes, but if the repository is relatively small with a few collaborators, it will take an instant. If you watch closely in your dashboard where your repository list appears, you will notice that your previous repository now has the organization's namespace before it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you head over to the repository's Settings in the Collaborators &amp; teams tab, you will see that you are listed under Collaborators. In this case, the access is set to Write since this is the default global value:</p>
<div><img src="img/00095.jpeg" class="calibre104"/></div>
<p>If you transfer your repository to an organization you are not an owner of, you might lose your admin privileges that you previously had on your repository. You can always ask an organization owner to grant you access.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">How to convert a user account into an organization</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">For the reasons mentioned in <em class="calibre14">The Difference between users and organizations</em> section, one might want to turn a personal account into an organization. This can be easily done in the user's <strong class="calibre5">Settings</strong> under the Organizations tab.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can then hit the Turn username into an organization button. Be sure that this is what you want because the action is irreversible.</p>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next step, you have to choose an owner of the organization. Start typing and when the name appears, select it and hit Choose. Finally, hit Create organization to start the conversion process.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Mentioning teams</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">A cool way to get a team's attention in issues and pull requests is by mentioning the whole team. This is achieved with the following syntax: <kbd class="calibre13">@organization/team</kbd>. For example, to get everybody's attention in the Documentation team, you would use something like this: <kbd class="calibre13">@github-essentials/documentation</kbd>. Only the members and owners of the organization can mention teams.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let's create an issue and see how this works. Head over to a repository that is under your organization and create a new issue and try to mention a team:</p>
<div><img src="img/00096.jpeg" class="calibre105"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">In case you are part of the team or are an owner, you will receive an email and a notification that will appear on your page at <a href="https://github.com/notifications" class="calibre10">https://github.com/notifications</a>:</p>
<div><img src="img/00097.jpeg" class="calibre106"/></div>
<div><p class="calibre19">The auto complete results are restricted to repository collaborators and any other participants on the thread, so it's not a full global search.</p>
</div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Organization feed only in dashboard</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">When you are on the landing page of <a href="https://github.com" class="calibre10">https://github.com</a>, you can see your dashboard activity of your repositories and the people you follow. Sometimes, when you are a member of many organizations the information might be cluttered, so you would rather filter the activity to one organization.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just choose the organization you wish to filter from the drop-down menu and you will see activities only from that organization. If you want, you can also subscribe to the news feed using the atom feed link found at the bottom:</p>
<div><img src="img/00098.jpeg" class="calibre107"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">That's it! Congratulations on finishing this chapter. You should now be familiar with almost all organization features. Creating teams, inviting people, and managing repository access should feel much more easier.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you found it difficult to follow, I would recommend you to just play with it, make a test organization, and go through the chapter again. Full disclosure, this is how this chapter was written. I created an organization, a second test user, and through trial and error this chapter was born. Given that GitHub has released new organization features in beta, I had to do a lot of testing. I think the result was worth the effort.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we will explore GitHub's strongest point: collaboration and pull requests.</p>
