    work as teams. At its core is the ethos of combining knowledge and teamwork. It
    allows collaboration within a single unit and between different departments in
    small or large companies (marketing, HR, IT, etc.). Users can combine all company-scale
    projects and teams.
  prefs: []

    simultaneously through Confluence. Because all this happens in the cloud, labor
    is saved and doesn’t require much extra effort. It creates an open, easy-to-use,
    secure platform that allows teams to brainstorm, interact, discuss, and disseminate
    knowledge. It helps to carry individual studies to the culture of team spirit
    and transforms monologue into dialogue. Planning, goal setting, executing, and
    learning come together in one place in an organized and user friendly manner.

    you if you have a business requirement preventing you from hosting your data in
    the cloud. Many companies want to strictly control who has access to data held
    in Atlassian products such as Confluence or Jira. These companies often choose
    Data Center over Cloud. Additionally, data residency on Cloud is limited for some
    countries, which can be a significant obstacle for companies in regulated industries
    such as finance or medicine. This limitation can make migration impossible, reinforcing
    the preference for Data Center solutions.

    efficient, and transparent approach to project management and collaboration. By
    connecting documentation, discussion, task tracking, and reporting across the
    two platforms, teams can work more seamlessly and maintain alignment with both
    high-level objectives and day-to-day tasks. It reduces the fragmentation of tools
    and information, leading to a more streamlined and productive working environment.

    in more detail later in the book. Now, we're giving you a summary of the templates

    is a team with geographically dispersed members who can work from anywhere. In
    asynchronous working, the communication doesn’t happen in real time. You send
    your messages when you’re ready; your colleagues respond when they’re ready. For
    example, you can send a text message, a voice message, or even a video clip of
    yourself to your colleague. You’re not in sync when you’re communicating with
    each other.
