- en: In this chapter, we concentrate on team-level agile, the foundation for scaling
    to the enterprise. Now more than ever, it's prudent to invest in your teams, their
    agile methods, and the tools that support them. Traditionally, teams have harnessed
    the power of colocation for effective face-to-face communication and collaboration
    (*Agile Manifesto*, Principle 6). One of the biggest challenges facing teams today
    is maintaining high performance and relentless improvement while fully remote
    and geographically dispersed due to various constraints, including the current
    global pandemic. Tools are now essential to support team planning, collaboration,
    and execution. Luckily, the Atlassian suite of products excels in this arena.
    While Jira Software is the central tool for team agility, Jira Align provides
    added features to help teams plan and collaborate, even when geographically dispersed.
    You will learn how teams connect and engage with Jira Align.

    knowledge enterprise gets done. Sprint after sprint, they focus with precision
    on delivering small batches of high-ranking user stories and shippable product
    increments of value to real customers. With Jira Software as their central collaborative
    workflow engine, they are able to hook into a variety of tools, including Bitbucket
    for version control and Bamboo for continuous integration and deployment. To put
    their work in context, teams can reference data like program increments and **Why?**
    button details pushed down from Jira Align while their work item statuses sync
    with Jira Align for rolled-up reporting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Team members using Jira Software are considered *integrated users* of Jira Align,
    which allows their data to sync with Align and for them to access Align's team-level
    functionality. To ensure that team members flow in from Jira Software, the Jira
    Align administrator must first go to **Jira Settings** | **Jira Setup** and set
    **Allow Jira to add users to team if they belong to an issue** to **Yes** under
    the **Settings** section. Note, however, that this setting could result in a duplicate
    user record if an integrated user was previously set up in Jira Align. To prevent
    duplicates, the user's email address in Jira Software must be exposed so that
    Jira Align can combine the integrated and native user accounts. As of the time
    of writing, a security issue prevents this from happening automatically.

    users by going to **Jira Settings** | **Jira Setup** and selecting a role for
    **Default System Role for New User(s)**. We recommend selecting the **Team Leads**
    role for slightly more access than the **Team Members** role, including the ability
    to use the Team Meetings module we will discuss shortly.

- en: In addition to integrated user access, it is common good practice for product
    owners and often scrum masters to have full Jira Align licenses in order to access
    program-level functionality, which we will cover in [*Chapter 5*](B16328_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079),
    *Program Planning Challenges*. We recommend that both roles have full licenses
    because they often work closely with product managers and RTEs at the program
    level and we've found that the ability to access higher-level functionality allows
    them to easily pivot and fill any gaps between program and team. For example,
    POs may help product managers break portfolio epics down into features, align
    on cross-program dependencies, and manage program risks. Scrum masters represent
    their teams at scrum of scrums meetings, work to remove impediments, coordinate
    with the RTE, escalate issues and risks, and align on dependencies at the program
    level.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both the PO and SM are emailed automatically when dependencies are requested
    of their teams. This ensures that they are in the loop even if the requesting
    team did not speak with them first, as would be expected. Note that this applies
    mainly to feature dependencies. Story dependencies are generally handled within
    Jira using the issue linking functionality.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Estimation, the process of predicting the most realistic effort required to
    deliver work items based on incomplete and uncertain input, is a typical challenge
    among development teams. Agile frameworks leverage relative estimating to mitigate
    this challenge. The power of relative estimating lies in accuracy over precision.
    If we were to ask you to look out the window and tell us how tall two buildings
    across the street are, chances are you couldn't give precise heights in feet or
    meters, but you could accurately state that one building is twice as tall as the
    other. Relative estimating allows teams to do the same thing with user stories.
    For reference, they start with a small, simple, and well-understood story (typically
    something that their team could build, test, and deploy in a day) and call it
    a 1-point story. They then estimate other stories relative to the 1-point story.
    For example, are they 2, 3, 5, or 8 times the volume, complexity, and uncertainty
    of the 1-point story?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Teams typically use the modified Fibonacci sequence to size stories, as it
    factors in the inherent uncertainty of larger work items: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20,
    40, and 100\. Think of the point sizes as buckets. If a story won''t fit into
    a given size, try the next largest bucket. Note that it''s best practice for teams
    to split any stories larger than an 8 or 13 into smaller stories before accepting
    them as ready to be worked on in a sprint.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now is where the fun comes in. In his 2005 book, *Agile Estimating and Planning*,
    Mike Cohn popularized a game called planning poker, wherein each team member has
    a set of cards with Fibonacci numbers for voting on the size of stories. Facilitated
    by the SM, with story context and clarifications provided by the PO, teams vote,
    discuss the high and low votes, uncover new information, and revote until they
    converge on the team's estimate for each story.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Jira Align's estimation games module allows geographically dispersed teams to
    play planning poker remotely. While this can be done using the chat feature, we
    recommend that a voice conference bridge be open for these critical conversations.
    Note too that teams play planning poker at various times. We recommend, at a minimum,
    playing at a backlog refinement session in advance of sprint planning. The reason
    is that if you wait until sprint planning, there's not enough time for the PO
    to adjust priorities based on the latest size estimates.

    of effort**) on story details panels in Jira Align. There may also be a field
    labeled **LOV** (**level of value**). Since value scores at the story level are
    not a standard agile practice, we recommend that the Jira Align administrator
    toggle off LOV under **Administration** | **Settings** | **Details Panels Settings**.
    The LOV functionality predates the current standard of capturing planned and actual
    business value at the program level, which we will cover in [*Chapter 5*](B16328_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079),

    in sprint view. It provides scrum teams with an easy way to load sprints according
    to their capacity during PI planning team breakouts. Teams typically begin their
    first breakout by estimating their capacity for each sprint of the PI based on
    their historical velocity (visible in either Jira Align or Jira Software) and
    their availability during the PI, factoring in things such as holidays, vacations,
    and training. They then identify and size the work items likely needed to implement
    the program's top prioritized features and begin loading them into upcoming sprints.

    committed versus delivered, and predictability. While burndowns and velocity are
    important for teams to review in Jira, the Jira Align sprint metrics (M1) report
    provides scrum masters, RTEs, team leads, and others with a way to see sprint-by-sprint
    metrics for an entire program increment. It's a useful report to review with teams
    during sprint planning or retrospectives. It helps teams see how they are progressing
    toward team and program goals for the PI. The focus of the report is on team delivery
    and predictability, not on velocity or comparing teams to one another. To get
    the most out of this report, teams must use the ceremonies within the Jira Align
    meetings module, as discussed earlier.
