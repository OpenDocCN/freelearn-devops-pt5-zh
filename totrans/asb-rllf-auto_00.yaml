- en: Automation is the key to IT modernization, and using the right automation tool
    is a crucial step in the automation journey for organizations. Ansible is an open
    source automation software that you can use for automating most of your operations
    with IT and application infrastructure components including servers, storage,
    network, and application platforms. Ansible is one of the most well-known open
    source automation tools in the IT world right now and has strong community support,
    with more than 5,000 active contributors around the world.

- en: Ansible is not a *learn-by-reading* technology. This book will help you to understand
    and practice the automation capabilities of Ansible with actual playbooks, configurations,
    and practical examples. It will help you to understand the basics of Ansible automation
    and slowly, you will learn how to use Ansible for automating your day-to-day tasks.

- en: You will learn real-life IT automation use cases with practical examples, such
    as simple system reports, security scanning, and weekly rebooting Linux machines.
    After that, the book will teach you how to implement collaboration in Ansible
    automation and how to automate other devices and platforms, such as Microsoft
    Windows, network devices, VMware, AWS, and GCP. You will also learn how to use
    Ansible in a DevOps workflow with Jenkins integration and container and application
    management on Kubernetes. To expand your knowledge further on enterprise automation,
    the book will also teach you about Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform, secret
    management, and Ansible integration with other tools, such as Jira and ServiceNow.
    There are chapters in this book that cover how to automate non-supported devices
    and platforms using raw commands and API calls using Ansible. Before the book
    concludes, you will also explore the Ansible best practices for storing managed
    node information, variables, credentials, and playbooks for production environments.

- en: In this book, I will first guide you through the installation and deployment
    of the Ansible automation tool, and later, I will explain some real IT use cases
    and methods to use Ansible for automating such operations. Since the focus of
    the book is on different automation use cases, some of the chapters might have
    additional technical requirements, such as basic knowledge of a specific technology
    or access to a lab environment (such as a Kubernetes cluster). For this, I have
    also covered the methods to arrange the development environment if you want to
    practice. Always refer to the Ansible documentation at [https://docs.ansible.com](https://docs.ansible.com)
    and other provided links in the chapters for further learning.
