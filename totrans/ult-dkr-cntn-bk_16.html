<h1 id="_idParaDest-351"><a id="_idTextAnchor351"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>In this chapter, if you want to follow along with the code, you need Docker Desktop and a code editor—preferably Visual Studio Code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Please navigate to the folder in which you have cloned the sample repository. Normally, this should be <code>~/The-Ultimate-Docker-Container-Book</code>:<pre class="source-code">
$ cd ~/The-Ultimate-Docker-Container-Book</pre></li> <li>Create a new subfolder called <code>ch16</code> and navigate to it:<pre class="source-code">
$ mkdir ch16 &amp;&amp; cd ch16</pre></li> </ol>
<p>A complete set of sample solutions to all the examples discussed in this chapter can be found in the <code>sample-solutions/ch16</code> folder or directly on GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Ultimate-Docker-Container-Book/tree/main/sample-solutions/ch16">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/The-Ultimate-Docker-Container-Book/tree/main/sample-solutions/ch16</a>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-352"><a id="_idTextAnchor352"/>Understanding Kubernetes architecture</h1>
<p>A Kubernetes <a id="_idIndexMarker1335"/>cluster consists of a set of servers. These servers can be VMs or physical servers. The latter is also called bare metal. Each member of the cluster can have one of two roles. It is either a Kubernetes master or a (worker) node. The former is used to manage the cluster, while the latter will run an application workload. I have put worker in parentheses since, in Kubernetes parlance, you only talk about a node when you’re talking about a server that runs application workloads. But in Docker and Swarm parlance, the equivalent is a worker node. I think that the notion of a worker node better describes the role of the server than a simple node.</p>
<p>In a cluster, you have a small and odd number of masters and as many worker nodes as needed. Small clusters might only have a few worker nodes, while more realistic clusters might have dozens or even hundreds of worker nodes. Technically, there is no limit to how many worker nodes a cluster can have. In reality, though, you might experience a significant slowdown in some management operations when dealing with thousands of nodes.</p>
<p>On the Kubernetes worker nodes, we run pods. This is a new concept not present in Docker or Docker Swarm. A pod is an atomic unit of execution on a Kubernetes cluster. In many cases, a pod contains a single container, but a pod can consist of many containers running co-located. We will describe pods in much more detail later in this section.</p>
<p>All members of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1336"/>cluster need to be connected by a physical network, the so-called <strong class="bold">underlay network</strong>. Kubernetes defines one flat network for the whole cluster. Kubernetes does not provide any networking implementation out of the box. Instead, it relies on plugins from third parties.</p>
<p>Kubernetes just <a id="_idIndexMarker1337"/>defines the <strong class="bold">Container Network Interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">CNI</strong>) and leaves the implementation to others. The CNI is pretty simple. It states that each pod running in the cluster must be able to reach any other pod also running in the cluster <a id="_idIndexMarker1338"/>without any <strong class="bold">Network Address Translation</strong> (<strong class="bold">NAT</strong>) happening in between. The same must be true between cluster nodes and pods, that is, applications or daemons running directly on a cluster node must be able to reach each pod in the cluster and vice versa.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of a Kubernetes cluster:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.1 – High-level architecture diagram of Kubernetes" height="629" src="img/Figure_16.01_B19199.jpg" width="746"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.1 – High-level architecture diagram of Kubernetes</p>
<p>The preceding diagram is explained as follows.</p>
<p>In the top box, in<a id="_idIndexMarker1339"/> the middle, we have a cluster of <code>etcd</code> nodes. An <code>etcd</code> node is a distributed key-value store that, in a Kubernetes cluster, is used to store all the states of the cluster. The number of <code>etcd</code> nodes has to be odd, as mandated by the Raft consensus protocol, which states which nodes are used to coordinate among themselves. When we talk about the Cluster State, we do not include data that is produced or consumed by applications running in the cluster. Instead, we’re talking about all the information on the topology of the cluster, what services are running, network settings, secrets used, and more. That said, this <code>etcd</code> cluster is mission-critical to the overall cluster and thus, we should never run only a single <code>etcd</code> server in a production environment or any environment that needs to be highly available.</p>
<p>Then, we have a cluster of Kubernetes master nodes, which also form a Consensus Group among themselves, similar to the <code>etcd</code> nodes. The number of master nodes also has to be odd. We can run clusters with a single master but we should never do that in a production or mission-critical system. There, we should always have at least three master nodes. Since the master nodes are used to manage the whole cluster, we are also talking about the management plane.</p>
<p>Master nodes use the <code>etcd</code> cluster as their backing store. It is good practice to put a <strong class="bold">load balancer</strong> (<strong class="bold">LB</strong>) in front <a id="_idIndexMarker1340"/>of master nodes with a well-known <strong class="bold">Fully Qualified Domain Name</strong> (<strong class="bold">FQDN</strong>), such <a id="_idIndexMarker1341"/>as <a href="https://admin.example.com">https://admin.example.com</a>. All tools that are used to manage the Kubernetes cluster should access it through this LB rather than using the public IP address of one of the master nodes. This is shown on the upper left side of the preceding diagram.</p>
<p>Toward the bottom of the diagram, we have a cluster of worker nodes. The number of nodes can be as low as one and does not have an upper limit.</p>
<p>Kubernetes master and worker nodes communicate with each other. It is a bidirectional form of communication that is different from the one we know from Docker Swarm. In Docker Swarm, only manager nodes communicate with worker nodes and never the other way around. All ingress traffic accessing applications running in the cluster should go through another load balancer.</p>
<p>This is the application<a id="_idIndexMarker1342"/> load balancer or reverse proxy. We never want external traffic to directly access any of the worker nodes.</p>
<p>Now that we have an idea about the high-level architecture of a Kubernetes cluster, let’s delve a bit more deeply and look at the Kubernetes master and worker nodes.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-353"><a id="_idTextAnchor353"/>Kubernetes master nodes</h1>
<p>Kubernetes master nodes <a id="_idIndexMarker1343"/>are used to manage a Kubernetes cluster. The following is a high-level diagram of such a master:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.2 – Kubernetes master" height="311" src="img/Figure_16.02_B19199.jpg" width="501"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.2 – Kubernetes master</p>
<p>At the bottom of the preceding diagram, we have the infrastructure, which can be a VM on-premises or in the cloud or a server (often called bare metal) on-premises or in the cloud.</p>
<p>Currently, Kubernetes masters only <a id="_idIndexMarker1344"/>run on Linux. The most popular Linux distributions, such as RHEL, CentOS, and Ubuntu, are supported. On this Linux machine, we have at least the following four Kubernetes services running:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>kubectl</code> use to manage the cluster and applications in the cluster.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Controller</strong>: The controller, or <a id="_idIndexMarker1347"/>more precisely the controller manager, is a control loop that observes the state of the cluster through the API server and makes changes, attempting to move the current or effective state toward the desired state if they differ.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Scheduler</strong>: The scheduler is a<a id="_idIndexMarker1348"/> service that tries its best to schedule pods on worker nodes while considering various boundary conditions, such as resource requirements, policies, quality-of-service requirements, and more.</li>
<li><code>etcd</code> that is used to store all information about the state of the cluster. To be more precise, <code>etcd</code>, which is used as a cluster store, does not necessarily have to be installed on the same node as the other Kubernetes services. Sometimes, Kubernetes clusters are configured to use standalone clusters of <code>etcd</code> servers, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 16</em><em class="italic">.1</em>. But which variant to use is an <a id="_idIndexMarker1350"/>advanced management decision and is outside the scope of this book.</li>
</ul>
<p>We need at least one <a id="_idIndexMarker1351"/>master, but to achieve high availability, we need three or more master nodes. This is very similar to what we have learned about the manager nodes of a Docker Swarm. In this regard, a Kubernetes master is equivalent to a Swarm manager node.</p>
<p>Kubernetes masters never run application workloads. Their sole purpose is to manage the cluster. Kubernetes masters build a Raft consensus group. The Raft protocol is a standard protocol used in situations where a group of members needs to make decisions. It is used in many well-known software products such as MongoDB, Docker SwarmKit, and Kubernetes. For a more thorough discussion of the Raft protocol, see the link in the <em class="italic">Further </em><em class="italic">reading</em> section.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Running workload on master</p>
<p class="callout">At times, specifically in development and test scenarios, it can make sense to work with a single-node Kubernetes cluster, which then naturally becomes a master and a worker node at the same time. But this scenario should be avoided in production.</p>
<p>As we mentioned in the previous section, the state of the Kubernetes cluster is stored in an <code>etcd</code> node. If the Kubernetes cluster is supposed to be highly available, then the <code>etcd</code> node must also be configured in HA mode, which normally means that we have at least three <code>etcd</code> instances running on different nodes.</p>
<p>Let’s state once again that the whole cluster state is stored in an <code>etcd</code> node. This includes all the information about all the cluster nodes, all the ReplicaSets, Deployments, secrets, network policies, routing information, and so on. It is therefore crucial that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker1352"/>a robust backup strategy in place for this key-value store.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at the nodes that will be running the actual workload of the cluster.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-354"><a id="_idTextAnchor354"/>Cluster nodes</h1>
<p>Cluster nodes are the nodes <a id="_idIndexMarker1353"/>with which Kubernetes schedules application workloads. They are the workhorses of the cluster. A Kubernetes cluster can have a few, dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of cluster nodes. Kubernetes has been built from the ground up for high scalability. Don’t forget that Kubernetes was modeled on Google Borg, which has run tens of thousands of containers for years:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.3 – Kubernetes worker node" height="261" src="img/Figure_16.03_B19199.jpg" width="501"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.3 – Kubernetes worker node</p>
<p>A worker node – which is a cluster node, as are the master nodes – can run on a VM, bare metal, on-premises, or in the cloud. Originally, worker nodes could only be configured on Linux. But since version 1.10 of Kubernetes, worker nodes can also run on Windows Server 2010 or later. It is perfectly fine to have a mixed cluster with Linux and Windows worker nodes.</p>
<p>On each node, we have three services that need to run, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>YAML</code> or <code>JSON</code> format and they declaratively describe a pod. We will get to know what pods are in the next section. <code>PodSpecs</code> is provided to Kubelet primarily through the API server.</li>
<li><code>containerd</code> since version 1.9 as its container runtime. Prior to that, it used the Docker daemon. Other container runtimes, such as <code>rkt</code> or <code>CRI-O</code>, can be used. The container runtime is responsible for managing and running the individual containers of a pod.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">kube-proxy</strong>: Finally, there<a id="_idIndexMarker1357"/> is kube-proxy. It runs as a daemon and is a simple network proxy and load balancer for all application services running on that particular node.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker1358"/>learned about the architecture of Kubernetes and the master and worker nodes, it is time to introduce the tooling that we can use to develop applications targeted at Kubernetes.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-355"><a id="_idTextAnchor355"/>Introduction to Play with Kubernetes</h1>
<p>Play with Kubernetes<a id="_idIndexMarker1359"/> is a free playground sponsored by Docker, where users can learn how to use Docker containers and deploy them to Kubernetes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/">https://labs.play-with-k8s.com/</a>.</li>
<li>Log in using your GitHub or Docker credentials.</li>
<li>Once successfully logged in, create a first cluster node or instance by clicking the <strong class="bold">+ ADD NEW INSTANCE</strong> button on the left side of the screen.</li>
<li>Follow the instructions on the screen to create a first master node for your Kubernetes sandbox cluster.</li>
<li>Initialize the cluster master node with the command as indicated in <em class="italic">step 1</em> of the instructions in the terminal window. It’s best if you directly copy the command from there. It should look like this:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address \   $(hostname -i) --pod-network-cidr 10.5.0.0/16</pre></li> </ol>
<p>The first command argument uses the name of the host to advertise the address of the Kubernetes API server and the second one defines the subnet the cluster is supposed to use.</p>
<ol>
<li value="6">Next, as indicated<a id="_idIndexMarker1360"/> in Point 2 of the instructions in the console, initialize networking in our Kubernetes cluster (note, the following command should be on a single line):<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl apply -f <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/master/daemonset/kubeadm-kuberouter.yaml">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudnativelabs/kube-router/master/daemonset/kubeadm-kuberouter.yaml</a></pre></li> <li>Create a second cluster node by again clicking the <strong class="bold">ADD NEW </strong><strong class="bold">INSTANCE</strong> button.</li>
<li>Once the node is ready, run the <code>join</code> command that was output during <em class="italic">step 4</em>, where <code>&lt;token-1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;token-2&gt;</code> are specific to your cluster:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubeadm join 192.168.0.13:6443 --token &lt;token-1&gt; \&gt;     --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash &lt;token-2&gt;</pre></li> </ol>
<p>It is best if you just copy the correct command from your command line in Play with Kubernetes.</p>
<ol>
<li value="9">Once the second node has joined the cluster, run the following command on the first node, where you initialized the cluster, to list the set of nodes in your new cluster:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl get nodes</pre></li> </ol>
<p>The output should look similar to this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
NAME    STATUS   ROLES                  AGE     VERSIONnode1   Ready    control-plane,master   6m28s   v1.20.1
node2   Ready    &lt;none&gt;                 32s     v1.20.1</pre>
<p>Note how Play with Kubernetes, at the time of writing, uses version 1.20.1 of Kubernetes, which even now is a rather old version. The latest stable version available is currently 1.27.x. But worry not; for our example version, 1.20.x, is enough.</p>
<p>Now let’s try to deploy a pod to this cluster. Don’t worry about what a <em class="italic">pod</em> is for now; we will delve into all the details about it later in this chapter. For the moment, just take it as is.</p>
<ol>
<li>In your chapter<a id="_idIndexMarker1361"/> code folder, create a new file called <code>sample-pod.yaml</code> and add the following content:<pre class="source-code">
apiVersion: v1kind: Podmetadata:  name: nginx  labels:    app: nginxspec:  containers:  - name: nginx    image: nginx:alpine    ports:    - containerPort: 80    - containerPort: 443</pre></li> <li>Now, to run the aforementioned pod on Play with Kubernetes, we need to copy the content of the preceding <code>yaml</code> file and create a new file on <code>node1</code> of our cluster:</li>
<li>Use <code>vi</code> to create a new file called <code>sample-pod.yaml</code>.</li>
<li>Hit <em class="italic">I</em> (the letter “i”) to switch into the insert mode of <code>vi</code>.</li>
<li>Paste the copied code snippet with <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> + <em class="italic">V</em> (or <em class="italic">Command</em> + <em class="italic">V</em> on a Mac) into this file.</li>
<li>Press <em class="italic">Esc</em> to go into the command mode of <code>vi</code>.</li>
<li>Input <code>:wq</code> and hit <em class="italic">Enter</em> to save the file and quit <code>vi</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
<p class="callout">Why are we using the Vi editor in our examples? It’s the editor that is installed on any Linux (or Unix) distribution and is thus always available. You can find a quick tutorial for the Vi editor here: <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-vi-editor.htm">https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-vi-editor.htm</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="8">Now let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1362"/>use the Kubernetes CLI called <code>kubectl</code> to deploy this pod. The <code>kubectl</code> CLI is already installed on each of the cluster nodes of your Play with Kubernetes cluster:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl create -f sample-pod.yaml</pre></li> </ol>
<p>Doing so results in this output:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
pod/nginx created</pre> <ol>
<li value="9">Now we list all of the pods:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl get pods</pre></li> </ol>
<p>We should see the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
NAME      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS  AGEnginx     1/1     Running      0      51s</pre>
<ol>
<li value="10">To be able to access this pod, we need to create a Service. Let’s use the <code>sample-service.yaml</code> file, which has the following content:<pre class="source-code">
apiVersion: v1kind: Servicemetadata:  name: nginx-servicespec:  type: NodePort  selector:    app: nginx  ports:  - name: nginx-port    protocol: TCP    port: 80    targetPort: http-web-svc</pre></li> </ol>
<p>Again, don’t worry <a id="_idIndexMarker1363"/>about what exactly a <em class="italic">Service</em> is at this time. We’ll explain this later.</p>
<ol>
<li value="11">Let’s just create this Service:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl create -f sample-service.yaml</pre></li> <li>Now let’s see what Kubernetes created and list all Services defined on the cluster:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl get services</pre></li> </ol>
<p>We should see something similar to this:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.4 – List of services" height="70" src="img/Figure_16.04_B19199.jpg" width="727"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.4 – List of services</p>
<p>Please note the <code>PORT(S)</code> column. In my case, Kubernetes mapped the <code>80</code> container port of Nginx to the <code>31384</code> node port. We will use this port in the next command. Make sure you use the port number assigned on your system instead!</p>
<ol>
<li value="13">Now, we can use <code>curl</code> to access the service:<pre class="source-code">
$ curl -4 http://localhost:31384</pre></li> </ol>
<p>We should receive the Nginx welcome page as an answer.</p>
<ol>
<li value="14">Before you continue, please remove the two objects you just created:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl delete po/nginx$ kubectl delete svc/nginx-service</pre></li> </ol>
<p>Note that in the aforementioned commands, the <code>po</code> shortcut is equivalent to <code>pod</code> or <code>pods</code>. The <code>kubectl</code> tool is very flexible and allows such abbreviations. Similarly, <code>svc</code> is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1364"/>shortcut for <code>service</code> or <code>services</code>.</p>
<p>In the next section, we are going to use Docker Desktop and its support for Kubernetes to run the same pod and service as we did in this section.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-356"><a id="_idTextAnchor356"/>Kubernetes support in Docker Desktop</h1>
<p>Starting from<a id="_idIndexMarker1365"/> version 18.01-ce, Docker Desktop started <a id="_idIndexMarker1366"/>to support Kubernetes out of the box. Developers who want to deploy their containerized applications to Kubernetes can use this orchestrator instead of SwarmKit. Kubernetes support is turned off by default and has to be enabled in the settings. The first time Kubernetes is enabled, Docker Desktop will need a moment to download all the components that are needed to create a single-node Kubernetes cluster. Contrary to minikube, which is also a single-node cluster, the version provided by the Docker <a id="_idIndexMarker1367"/>tools uses <strong class="bold">containerized</strong> versions of all Kubernetes components:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.5 – Kubernetes support in Docker Desktop" height="311" src="img/Figure_16.05_B19199.jpg" width="421"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.5 – Kubernetes support in Docker Desktop</p>
<p>The preceding diagram gives us a rough overview of how Kubernetes support has been added to Docker Desktop. Docker Desktop for macOS uses hyperkit to run a LinuxKit-based VM. Docker<a id="_idIndexMarker1368"/> Desktop for Windows uses Hyper-V to <a id="_idIndexMarker1369"/>achieve the result. Inside the VM, Docker Engine is installed. Part of the engine is SwarmKit, which enables Swarm mode. Docker Desktop uses the <code>kubeadm</code> tool to set up and configure Kubernetes in that VM. The following three facts are worth mentioning: Kubernetes stores its cluster state in <code>etcd</code>; thus, we have <code>etcd</code> running on this VM. Then, we have all the services that make up Kubernetes and, finally, some services that support the Deployment of Docker stacks from the Docker CLI into Kubernetes. This Service is not part of the official Kubernetes distribution, but it is Docker-specific.</p>
<p>All Kubernetes components run in containers in the LinuxKit VM. These containers can be hidden through a setting in Docker Desktop. Later in this section, we’ll provide a complete list of Kubernetes system containers that will be running on your laptop, if you have Kubernetes support enabled.</p>
<p>One big advantage of Docker Desktop with Kubernetes enabled over minikube is that the former allows developers to use a single tool to build, test, and run a containerized application targeted at Kubernetes. It is even possible to deploy a multi-service application into Kubernetes using a Docker Compose file.</p>
<p>Now let’s get our hands dirty:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we have to enable Kubernetes. On macOS, click on the Docker icon in the menu bar. On Windows, go to the command tray and select <strong class="bold">Preferences</strong>. In the dialog box <a id="_idIndexMarker1370"/>that<a id="_idIndexMarker1371"/> opens, select <strong class="bold">Kubernetes</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.6 – Enabling Kubernetes in Docker Desktop</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">Then, tick the <strong class="bold">Enable Kubernetes</strong> checkbox. Also, tick the <strong class="bold">Show system containers (</strong><strong class="bold">advanced)</strong> checkboxes.</li>
<li>Then, click the <strong class="bold">Apply &amp; restart</strong> button. Installing and configuring Kubernetes takes a few minutes. It’s time to take a break and enjoy a nice cup of tea.</li>
<li>Once the installation is finished (which Docker notifies us of by showing a green status icon in the <code>kubectl</code> to access the latter.</li>
<li>First, let’s list all the contexts that we have. We can use the following command for this:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl config get-contexts</pre></li> </ol>
<p>In the case of the author’s laptop, we get this output:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.7 – List of contexts for kubectl" height="158" src="img/Figure_16.07_B19199.jpg" width="1032"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.7 – List of contexts for kubectl</p>
<p>Here, we can<a id="_idIndexMarker1372"/> see<a id="_idIndexMarker1373"/> that, on the author’s laptop, we have three contexts, two of them stemming from his use of <code>kind</code>. Currently, the <code>kind</code> context with the <code>kind-demo</code> name is still active, flagged by the asterisk in the <code>CURRENT</code> column.</p>
<ol>
<li value="6">We can switch to the <code>docker-desktop</code> context using the following command:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl config use-context docker-desktop</pre></li> </ol>
<p>Doing so results in this ouput:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
Switched to context "docker-desktop"</pre> <ol>
<li value="7">Now we can use <code>kubectl</code> to access the cluster that Docker Desktop just created:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl get nodes</pre></li> </ol>
<p>We should see something simliar to the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
NAME    STATUS   ROLES             AGE      VERSIONnode1     Ready    control-plane  6m28s   v1.25.9</pre>
<p>OK, this looks very familiar. It is pretty much the same as what we saw when working with Play with Kubernetes. The version of Kubernetes that the author’s Docker Desktop is using is 1.25.9. We can also see that the node is a <code>master</code> node, indicated by the role <code>control-plane</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="8">If we list all the containers that are currently running on our Docker Desktop, we get the list shown in the following screenshot (note that we use the <code>--format</code> argument to output the container ID and names of the containers):<pre class="source-code">
$ docker container list --format "table {{.ID}\t{{.Names}}"</pre></li> </ol>

<p>In the preceding list, we can identify all the now-familiar components that make up Kubernetes, as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>API server</li>
<li><code>etcd</code></li>
<li><code>kube-proxy</code></li>
<li>DNS service</li>
<li><code>kube-controller</code></li>
<li><code>kube-scheduler</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Normally, we don’t want to clutter our list of containers with these system containers. Therefore, we can uncheck the <strong class="bold">Show system containers (advanced)</strong> checkbox in the settings for Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Now let’s try to deploy a Docker Compose application to Kubernetes.</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate<a id="_idIndexMarker1376"/> to<a id="_idIndexMarker1377"/> the <code>ch16</code> subfolder of our <code>~/</code><code>The-Ultimate-Docker-Container-Book</code> folder.</li>
<li>Copy the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file from the sample solutions to this location:<pre class="source-code">
$ cp ../sample-solutions/ch16/docker-compose.yml .</pre></li> <li>Install the <code>kompose</code> tool on your machine by following the instructions on https://kompose.io/installation/:<ul><li>On a Mac, it can be installed using <code>$ brew </code><code>install kompose</code></li><li>On Windows, use <code>$ choco </code><code>install kubernetes-kompose</code></li></ul></li>
<li>Run the <code>kompose</code> tool as follows:<pre class="source-code">
$ kompose convert</pre></li> </ol>
<p>The tool should create four files:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>db-deployment.yaml</code></li>
<li><code>pets-data-persistentvolumeclaim.yaml</code></li>
<li><code>web-deployment.yaml</code></li>
<li><code>web-service.yaml</code></li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li value="5">Open the <code>web-service.yaml</code> file and after line 11 (the <code>spec</code> entry), add the <code>NodePort</code> entry type so that it looks as follows:<pre class="source-code">
...spec:  type: NodePort  ports:    - name: "3000"...</pre></li> <li>Now we can use <code>kubectl</code> to deploy these four resources to our Kubernetes cluster:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl apply –f '*.yaml'</pre></li> </ol>
<p>We should see this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
deployment.apps/db createdpersistentvolumeclaim/pets-data created
deployment.apps/web created
service/web created</pre>
<ol>
<li value="7">We need to find out<a id="_idIndexMarker1378"/> to <a id="_idIndexMarker1379"/>which host port Kubernetes has mapped the <code>3000</code> service port. Use the following command for this:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl get service</pre></li> </ol>
<p>You should see something similar to this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
NAME       TYPE      CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP PORT(S)       AGEkubernetes ClusterIP 10.96.0.1    &lt;none&gt;      443/TCP       10d
web        NodePort  0.111.98.154 &lt;none&gt;   3000:32134/TCP   5m33s</pre>
<p>In my case, we can see that the service web has the <code>3000</code> port mapped to the <code>32134</code> host (or node) port. In the following command, I have to use that port. In your case, the number likely will be different. Use the number you are getting from the previous command!</p>
<ol>
<li value="8">We can test the application using <code>curl</code>:<pre class="source-code">
$ curl localhost:32134/pet</pre></li> </ol>
<p>We will see that it is running as expected:</p>

<p>Now, let’s see<a id="_idIndexMarker1380"/> exactly <a id="_idIndexMarker1381"/>what resources we have on Kubernetes after the previous Deployment.</p>
<ol>
<li value="9">We can use <code>kubectl</code> to find out:<pre class="source-code">

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.10 – Listing all Kubernetes objects created by Docker stack deploy</p>
<p>Docker created a Deployment for the <code>web</code> service and <code>db</code> service. It also automatically created a Kubernetes service for <code>web</code> so that it can be accessed inside the cluster.</p>
<p>This is pretty cool, to say the least, and tremendously decreases friction in the development process for teams targeting Kubernetes as their orchestration platform.</p>
<ol>
<li value="10">Before you continue, please remove the stack from the cluster:<pre class="source-code">

<p>Now that we have had an introduction to the tools we can use to develop applications that will eventually run in<a id="_idIndexMarker1382"/> a <a id="_idIndexMarker1383"/>Kubernetes cluster, it is time to learn about all the important Kubernetes objects that are used to define and manage such an application. We will start with pods.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-357"><a id="_idTextAnchor357"/>Introduction to pods</h1>
<p>Contrary to what is possible<a id="_idIndexMarker1384"/> in Docker Swarm, you cannot run containers directly in a Kubernetes cluster. In a Kubernetes cluster, you can only run pods. <strong class="bold">Pods</strong> are the atomic units of Deployment in Kubernetes. A pod is an abstraction of one or many co-located containers that share the same kernel namespaces, such as the network namespace. No equivalent exists in Docker SwarmKit. The fact that more than one container can be co-located and shared with the same network namespace is a very powerful concept. The following diagram illustrates two pods:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.11 – Kubernetes pods" height="271" src="img/Figure_16.11_B19199.jpg" width="581"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.11 – Kubernetes pods</p>
<p>In the preceding diagram, we have two pods, <code>10.0.12.3</code> and <code>10.0.12.5</code>. Both are part of a private subnet managed by the Kubernetes network driver.</p>
<p>A pod can contain one or many containers. All those containers share the same Linux kernel namespaces, and in particular, they share the network namespace. This is indicated by the dashed rectangle surrounding the containers. Since all containers running in the same pod share the network namespace, each container needs to make sure to use its own port since duplicate ports are not allowed in a single network namespace. In this case, in Pod 1, the main container is using the <code>80</code> port while the supporting container is using the <code>3000</code> port.</p>
<p>Requests from other<a id="_idIndexMarker1385"/> pods or nodes can use the pod’s IP address combined with the corresponding port number to access the individual containers. For example, you could access the application running in the main container of Pod 1 through <code>10.0.12.3:80</code>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-358"><a id="_idTextAnchor358"/>Comparing Docker container and Kubernetes pod networking</h2>
<p>Now, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1386"/>compare <a id="_idIndexMarker1387"/>Docker’s<a id="_idIndexMarker1388"/> container networking and Kubernetes pod networking. In the following diagram, we have Docker on the left-hand side and Kubernetes on the right-hand side:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.12 – Containers in a pod sharing the same network namespace" height="291" src="img/Figure_16.12_B19199.jpg" width="562"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.12 – Containers in a pod sharing the same network namespace</p>
<p>When a Docker container is created and no specific network is specified, then Docker Engine creates a virtual ethernet (<code>veth</code>) endpoint. The first container gets <code>veth0</code>, the next one gets <code>veth1</code>, and so on. These virtual ethernet endpoints are connected to the<a id="_idIndexMarker1389"/> Linux<a id="_idIndexMarker1390"/> bridge, <code>docker0</code>, that Docker <a id="_idIndexMarker1391"/>automatically creates upon installation. Traffic is routed from the <code>docker0</code> bridge to every connected <code>veth</code> endpoint. Every container has its own network namespace. No two containers use the same namespace. This is on purpose, to isolate applications running inside the containers from each other.</p>
<p>For a Kubernetes pod, the situation is different. When creating a new pod, Kubernetes first creates a so-called <code>pause</code> container, the purpose of which is to create and manage the namespaces that the pod will share with all containers. Other than that, it does nothing useful; it is just sleeping. The <code>pause</code> container is connected to the <code>docker0</code> bridge through <code>veth0</code>. Any subsequent container that will be part of the pod uses a special feature of Docker Engine that allows it to reuse an existing network namespace. The syntax to do so looks like this:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
$ docker container create --net container:pause ...</pre> <p>The important part is the <code>--net</code> argument, which uses <code>container:&lt;container name&gt;</code> as a value. If we create a new container this way, then Docker does not create a new <code>veth</code> endpoint; the container uses the same one as the pause container.</p>
<p>Another important consequence of multiple containers sharing the same network namespace is the way they communicate with each other. Let’s consider the following situation: a pod containing two containers, one listening at the <code>80</code> port and the other at the <code>3000</code> port:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.13 – Containers in pods communicating via localhost" height="162" src="img/Figure_16.13_B19199.jpg" width="252"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.13 – Containers in pods communicating via localhost</p>
<p>When two containers use the same Linux kernel network namespace, they can communicate with each other through <code>localhost</code>, similarly to how, when two processes <a id="_idIndexMarker1392"/>are<a id="_idIndexMarker1393"/> running <a id="_idIndexMarker1394"/>on the same host, they can communicate with each other through <code>localhost</code> too.</p>
<p>This is illustrated in the preceding diagram. From the <code>main</code> container, the containerized application inside it can reach out to the service running inside the supporting container through http://localhost:3000.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-359"><a id="_idTextAnchor359"/>Sharing the network namespace</h2>
<p>After all this<a id="_idIndexMarker1395"/> theory, you might be wondering how a pod is <a id="_idIndexMarker1396"/>actually created by Kubernetes.</p>
<p>Kubernetes only uses what Docker provides. So, how does this network namespace share work? First, Kubernetes creates the so-called <code>pause</code> container, as mentioned previously.</p>
<p>This container has no other function than to reserve the kernel namespaces for that pod and keep them alive, even if no other container inside the pod is running. Let’s simulate the creation of a pod, then. We start by creating the pause container and use Nginx for this purpose:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
$ docker container run –detach \    --name pause nginx:alpine</pre>
<p>Now we add a second container called <code>main</code> and attach it to the same network namespace as the<a id="_idIndexMarker1397"/> pause container:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
$ docker container run --name main \ -d -it \    --net container:pause \
    alpine:latest ash</pre>
<p>Since the <code>pause</code> and sample <code>containers</code> are both parts of the same network namespace, they can reach each other through <code>localhost</code>. To show this, we have to exec into the main container:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
$ docker exec -it main /bin/sh</pre> <p>Now we can test the connection to Nginx running in the pause container and listening on the <code>80</code> port. The following is what we get if we use the <code>wget</code> utility to do so:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
/ # wget -qO – localhost</pre> <p>Doing so gives us this output:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.14 – Two containers sharing the same network namespace" height="686" src="img/Figure_16.14_B19199.jpg" width="1100"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.14 – Two containers sharing the same network namespace</p>
<p>The output shows that we can indeed access Nginx on <code>localhost</code>. This is proof that the two containers <a id="_idIndexMarker1398"/>share the same namespace. If that is<a id="_idIndexMarker1399"/> not enough, we can use the <code>ip</code> tool to show <code>eth0</code> inside both containers and we will get the exact same result, specifically, the same IP address, which is one of the characteristics of a pod; all its containers share the same IP address:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
/ # ip a show eth0</pre> <p>This will show the following output:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.15 – Displaying the properties of eth0 with the ip tool" height="151" src="img/Figure_16.15_B19199.jpg" width="1099"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.15 – Displaying the properties of eth0 with the ip tool</p>
<p>We inspect the <code>bridge</code> network with the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
$ docker network inspect bridge</pre> <p>After that, we can see that only the pause container is listed:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
[    {
        "Name": "bridge",
        "Id": "c7c30ad64...",
        "Created": "2023-05-18T08:22:42.054696Z",

                "IPv6Address": ""
            }
        },
...
     }
]</pre>
<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker1400"/> preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker1401"/> output has been shortened for readability.</p>
<p>The main container didn’t get an entry in the <code>Containers</code> list since it is reusing the <code>pause</code> container’s endpoint.</p>
<p>Before you continue, please remove the two <code>pause</code> and <code>main</code> containers:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
$ docker container rm pause main</pre> <p>Next, we will be looking at the pod life cycle.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-360"><a id="_idTextAnchor360"/>Pod life cycle</h2>
<p>Earlier in this book, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1402"/> learned that containers have a life cycle. A container is initialized, run, and ultimately exited. When a container exits, it can do this gracefully with an exit code zero or it can terminate with an error, which is equivalent to a non-zero exit code.</p>
<p>Similarly, a pod has a life cycle. Because a pod can contain more than one container, this life cycle is slightly more complicated than that of a single container. The life cycle of a pod can be seen in the following diagram:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.16 – The life cycle of Kubernetes pods" height="281" src="img/Figure_16.16_B19199.jpg" width="591"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.16 – The life cycle of Kubernetes pods</p>
<p>When a pod is created on a cluster node, it first enters the <em class="italic">pending</em> status. Once all the containers of the pod are up and running, the pod enters the <em class="italic">running</em> status. The pod only enters into this state if all its containers run successfully. If the pod is asked to terminate, it will request all its containers to terminate. If all containers terminate with exit code zero, then the pod enters into the <em class="italic">succeeded</em> status. This is the happy path.</p>
<p>Now, let’s look at some scenarios that lead to the pod being in a <em class="italic">failed</em> state. There are three possible scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>If, during the startup of the pod, at least one container is not able to run and fails (that is, it exits with a nonzero exit code), the pod goes from the <em class="italic">pending</em> state into the failed state.</li>
<li>If the pod is in the <em class="italic">running</em> status and one of the containers suddenly crashes or exits with a nonzero exit code, then the pod transitions from the <em class="italic">running</em> state into the <em class="italic">failed</em> state.</li>
<li>If the pod is asked to terminate and, during the shutdown, at least one of the containers, exits<a id="_idIndexMarker1403"/> with a nonzero exit code, then the pod also enters into the <em class="italic">failed</em> state.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now let’s look at the specifications for a pod.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-361"><a id="_idTextAnchor361"/>Pod specifications</h2>
<p>When creating a<a id="_idIndexMarker1404"/> pod in a Kubernetes cluster, we can use either an imperative or a declarative approach. We discussed the difference between the two approaches earlier in this book but, to rephrase the most important aspect, using a declarative approach signifies that we write a manifest that describes the end state we want to achieve. We’ll leave out the details of the orchestrator. The end state that we want to achieve is also called the desired state. In general, the declarative approach is strongly preferred in all established orchestrators, and Kubernetes is no exception.</p>
<p>Thus, in this chapter, we will exclusively concentrate on the declarative approach. Manifests or specifications for a pod can be written using either the <code>YAML</code> or <code>JSON</code> formats. In this chapter, we will concentrate on <code>YAML</code> since it is easier to read for us humans. Let’s look at a sample specification. Here is the content of the <code>pod.yaml</code> file, which can be found in the <code>ch16</code> subfolder of our <code>labs</code> folder:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
apiVersion: v1kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: web-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - name: web
    image: nginx:alpine
    ports:
    - containerPort: 80</pre>
<p>Each specification in Kubernetes starts with the version information. Pods have been around for quite some time and thus the API version is <code>v1</code>. The second line specifies the type of Kubernetes object or resource we want to define. Obviously, in this case, we want to specify a pod. Next follows a block containing metadata. At a bare minimum, we need to give the pod a name. Here, we call it <code>web-pod</code>. The next block that follows is the <code>spec</code> block, which contains the specification of the pod. The most important part (and the only one in this simple sample) is a list of all containers that are part of this pod. We only have one container here, but multiple containers are possible. The name we chose for our container is <code>web</code> and the container image is <code>nginx:alpine</code>. Finally, we define a list of ports the container is exposing.</p>
<p>Once we have <a id="_idIndexMarker1405"/>authored such a specification, we can apply it to the cluster using the Kubernetes CLI, <code>kubectl</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a new terminal window and navigate to the <code>ch16</code> subfolder:<pre class="source-code">
$ cd ~/The-Ultimate-Docker-Contianer-Book/ch16</pre></li> <li>In this example, we’re going to use Docker Desktop’s Kubernetes cluster. Thus, make sure that you are using the right context for the <code>kubectl</code> CLI:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl config use-context docker-desktop</pre></li> </ol>
<p>This will switch the context to our Kubernetes cluster provided by Docker Desktop.</p>
<ol>
<li value="3">In this folder, create a new file called <code>pod.yml</code> and add the mentioned pod specification to it. Save the file.</li>
<li>Execute the following command:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl create -f pod.yaml</pre></li> </ol>
<p>This will respond with <code>pod "</code><code>web-pod" created</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">We can then list all the pods in the cluster:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl get pods</pre></li> </ol>
<p>Doing so will provide us with this output:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
NAME          READY      STATUS     RESTARTS     AGEweb-pod       1/1        Running        0        2m</pre>
<p>As expected, we have one of one pod in the <code>Running</code> state. The pod is called <code>web-pod</code>, as defined.</p>
<ol>
<li value="6">We can get more detailed information about the running pod by using the <code>describe</code> command:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl describe pod/web-<code>pod</code></pre></li> </ol>
<p>This gives us<a id="_idIndexMarker1406"/> something similar to this:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.17 – Describing a pod running in the cluster" height="729" src="img/Figure_16.17_B19199.jpg" width="1101"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.17 – Describing a pod running in the cluster</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">The <code>pod/web-pod</code> notation in the previous section includes the <code>describe</code> command. Other variants are possible. For example, <code>pods/web-pod</code>, <code>po/web-pod</code>, <code>pod</code>, and <code>po</code> are aliases of <code>pods</code>.</p>
<p class="callout">The <code>kubectl</code> tool defines many aliases to make our lives a bit easier.</p>
<p class="callout">The <code>describe</code> command gives us a plethora of valuable information about the pod, not the least of which is a list of events that happened and affected this pod. The list is shown at the end of the output.</p>
<p>The information in the <code>Containers</code> section is very similar to what we find in a <code>docker container </code><code>inspect</code> output.</p>
<p>We can also see a <code>Volumes</code> section with a <code>Projected</code> entry type. It contains the root certificate of the<a id="_idIndexMarker1407"/> cluster as a secret. We will discuss Kubernetes secrets in the next chapter. Volumes, on the other hand, will be discussed next.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-362"><a id="_idTextAnchor362"/>Pods and volumes</h2>
<p>In the chapter about <a id="_idIndexMarker1408"/>containers, we<a id="_idIndexMarker1409"/> learned about volumes and their purpose: accessing and storing persistent data. Since containers can mount volumes, pods can do so as well. In reality, it is really the containers inside the pod that mount the volumes, but that is just a semantic detail. First, let’s see how we can define a volume in Kubernetes. Kubernetes supports a plethora of volume types, so we won’t delve into too much detail about this.</p>
<p>Let’s just create a local volume implicitly by defining a <code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code> claim called <code>my-data-claim</code>:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a file called <code>volume-claim.yaml</code> and add the following specification to it:<pre class="source-code">
apiVersion: v1kind: PersistentVolumeClaimmetadata:  name: my-data-claimspec:  accessModes:  - ReadWriteOnce  resources:    requests:      storage: 2Gi</pre></li> </ol>
<p>We have defined a claim that requests 2 GB of data.</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">Let’s create this claim:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl create -f volume-claim.yaml</pre></li> </ol>
<p>This will resulting in the following output:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
persistentvolumeclaim/my-data-claim created</pre> <ol>
<li value="3">We can list<a id="_idIndexMarker1410"/> the <a id="_idIndexMarker1411"/>claim using <code>kubectl</code> (<code>pvc</code> is a shortcut for <code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code>) with the following:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl get pvc</pre></li> </ol>
<p>This gives us this output:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.18 – List of PersistentStorageClaim objects in the cluster" height="81" src="img/Figure_16.18_B19199.jpg" width="1261"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.18 – List of PersistentStorageClaim objects in the cluster</p>
<p>In the output, we can see that the claim has implicitly created a volume called <code>pvc-&lt;ID&gt;</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">Remove the pod before you continue:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl delete pod/web-pod</pre></li> </ol>
<p>Alternatively, use the original file defining the pod with the following command:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl delete -f pod.yaml</pre> <p>We are now ready to use the volume created by the claim in a pod. Let’s use a modified version of the pod specification that we used previously:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a file called <code>pod-with-vol.yaml</code> and <a id="_idIndexMarker1412"/>add the <a id="_idIndexMarker1413"/>following specification to it:<pre class="source-code">
apiVersion: v1kind: Podmetadata:  name: web-podspec:  containers:  - name: web    image: nginx:alpine    ports:    - containerPort: 80    volumeMounts:    - name: my-data      mountPath: /data  volumes:  - name: my-data    persistentVolumeClaim:      claimName: my-data-claim</pre></li> </ol>
<p>In the last four lines, in the <code>volumes</code> block, we define a list of volumes we want to use for this pod. The volumes that we list here can be used by any of the containers of the pod. In our particular case, we only have one volume. We specify that we have a volume called <code>my-data</code>, which is a persistent volume claim whose claim name is the one we just created.</p>
<p>Then, in the container specification, we have the <code>volumeMounts</code> block, which is where we define the volume we want to use and the (absolute) path inside the container where the volume will be mounted. In our case, we mount the volume to the <code>/data</code> folder of the container filesystem.</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">Let’s create this pod:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl create -f pod-with-vol.yaml</pre></li> </ol>
<p>We can also use the declarative way:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl apply -f pod-with-vol.yaml</pre> <ol>
<li value="3">Then, we can <code>exec</code> into the container to double-check that the volume has mounted by <a id="_idIndexMarker1414"/>navigating<a id="_idIndexMarker1415"/> to the <code>/data</code> folder, creating a file there, and exiting the container using:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl exec -it web-pod -- /bin/sh/ # cd /data/data # echo "Hello world!" &gt; sample.txt/data # exit</pre></li> </ol>
<p>If we are right, then the data in this container must persist beyond the life cycle of the pod.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">Thus, let’s delete the pod:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl delete pod/web-pod</pre></li> <li>Then, we’ll recreate it:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl create -f pod-with-vol.yaml</pre></li> <li>We’ll then <code>exec</code> into the container of the pod:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl exec -it web-pod  -- ash</pre></li> <li>Finally, we output the data:<pre class="source-code">

</ol>
<p>Now that we have a<a id="_idIndexMarker1416"/> good<a id="_idIndexMarker1417"/> understanding of pods, let’s investigate how those pods are managed with the help of ReplicaSets.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-363"><a id="_idTextAnchor363"/>Kubernetes ReplicaSets</h1>
<p>A single pod in an<a id="_idIndexMarker1418"/> environment with high availability requirements is insufficient. What if the pod crashes? What if we need to update the application running inside the pod but cannot afford any service interruption? These questions and more indicate that pods alone are not enough, and we need a higher-level concept that can manage multiple instances of the same pod. In Kubernetes, the ReplicaSet is used to define and manage such a collection of identical pods that are running on different cluster nodes. Among other things, a ReplicaSet defines which container images are used by the containers running inside a pod and how many instances of the pod will run in the cluster. These properties and many others are<a id="_idIndexMarker1419"/> called the <strong class="bold">desired state</strong>.</p>
<p>The ReplicaSet is responsible for reconciling the desired state at all times if the actual state ever deviates from it. Here is a Kubernetes ReplicaSet:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.19 – Kubernetes ReplicaSet" height="152" src="img/Figure_16.19_B19199.jpg" width="532"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.19 – Kubernetes ReplicaSet</p>
<p>In the preceding diagram, we can see a ReplicaSet that governs a number of pods. The pods are called <code>pod-api</code>. The ReplicaSet is responsible for making sure that, at any given time, there is always the desired number of pods running. If one of the pods crashes for whatever reason, the ReplicaSet schedules a new pod on a node with free resources instead. If there are more pods than the desired number, then the ReplicaSet kills superfluous pods. With this, we can say that the ReplicaSet guarantees a self-healing and scalable<a id="_idIndexMarker1420"/> set of pods. There is no limit to how many pods a ReplicaSet can hold.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-364"><a id="_idTextAnchor364"/>ReplicaSet specification</h2>
<p>Similar to what <a id="_idIndexMarker1421"/>we have learned about pods, Kubernetes also allows us to either imperatively or declaratively define and create a ReplicaSet. Since the declarative approach is by far the most recommended one in most cases, we’re going to concentrate on this approach. Let’s work with a sample specification for a Kubernetes ReplicaSet:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new file called <code>replicaset.yaml</code> and add the following content to it:<pre class="source-code">
apiVersion: apps/v1kind: ReplicaSetmetadata:  name: rs-webspec:  selector:    matchLabels:      app: web  replicas: 3  template:    metadata:      labels:        app: web    spec:      containers:      - name: nginx        image: nginx:alpine        ports:        - containerPort: 80</pre></li> </ol>
<p>This looks an awful lot like the pod specification we introduced earlier. Let’s concentrate on the differences, then. First, on line 2, we have the kind, which was a pod, and is now <code>ReplicaSet</code>. Then, on lines 6–8, we have a selector, which determines the pods that will be part of the ReplicaSet. In this case, it is all the pods that have <code>app</code> as a label with the value <code>web</code>. Then, on line 9, we define how many replicas of the pod we want to run; three, in this case. Finally, we have the <code>template</code> section, which first defines the metadata, and then the spec, which defines<a id="_idIndexMarker1422"/> the containers that run inside the pod. In our case, we have a single container using the <code>nginx:alpine</code> image and exporting <code>80</code> port.</p>
<p>The really important elements are the number of replicas and the selector, which specifies the set of pods governed by the ReplicaSet.</p>
<ol>
<li value="2">Let’s use this file to create the ReplicaSet:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl create -f replicaset.yaml</pre></li> </ol>
<p>This results in the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
replicaset "rs-web" created</pre> <ol>
<li value="3">Now we list all the ReplicaSets in the cluster (<code>rs</code> is a shortcut for ReplicaSet):<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl get rs</pre></li> </ol>
<p>We get the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
NAME        DESIRED  CURRENT   READY    AGErs-web         3       3         3      51s</pre>
<p>In the preceding output, we can see that we have a single ReplicaSet called <code>rs-web</code>, the desired state of which is three (pods). The current state also shows three pods and tells us that all three pods are ready.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">We can also list all the pods in the system:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl get pods</pre></li> </ol>
<p>This results in the following output:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
NAME                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGErs-web-nbc8m    1/1        Running   0                    4m
rs-web-6bxn5    1/1        Running   0                    4m
rs-web-lqhm5    1/1        Running   0                    4m</pre>
<p>Here we can see our three expected pods. The names of the pods use the <code>ReplicaSet</code> name with a unique ID appended for each pod. In the <code>READY</code> column, we can see how many containers have been defined in the pod and how many of <a id="_idIndexMarker1423"/>them are ready. In our case, we only have a single container per pod and, in each case, it is ready. Thus, the overall status of the pod is <code>Running</code>. We can also see how many times each pod had to be restarted. In our case, we don’t have any restarts.</p>
<p>Next, let’s see how the ReplicaSet helps us with self-healing.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-365"><a id="_idTextAnchor365"/>Self-healing</h2>
<p>Now, let’s test the <a id="_idIndexMarker1424"/>magic powers of the self-healing ReplicaSet by randomly killing one of its pods and observing what happens:</p>
<ol>
<li>Let’s delete the first pod from the previous list. Make sure to replace the name of the pod (<code>rs-web-nbc8m</code>) with the name you have in your own example:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl delete po/rs-web-nbc8m</pre></li> </ol>
<p>The previous command produces the following output:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
pod "rs-web-nbc8m" deleted</pre> <ol>
<li value="2">Now, let’s list all the pods again. We expect to see only two pods, right? You’re wrong:<pre class="source-code">
NAME                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGErs-web-4r587    1/1        Running   0                    5srs-web-6bxn5    1/1        Running   0                    4m30srs-web-lqhm5    1/1        Running   0                    4m30</pre></li> </ol>
<p>OK. Evidently, the<a id="_idIndexMarker1425"/> first pod in the list has been recreated, as we can see from the <code>AGE</code> column. This is auto-healing in action.</p>
<ol>
<li value="3">Let’s see what we discover if we describe the ReplicaSet:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl describe rs</pre></li> </ol>
<p>This will give us this output:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.20 – Describe the ReplicaSet" height="543" src="img/Figure_16.20_B19199.jpg" width="924"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.20 – Describe the ReplicaSet</p>
<p>And indeed, we find an entry under <code>Events</code> that tells us that the ReplicaSet created a new pod called <code>rs-web-4r587</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">Before you <a id="_idIndexMarker1426"/>continue, please delete the ReplicaSet:<pre class="source-code">
$ kubectl delete rs/rs-web</pre></li> </ol>
<p>Now it’s time to talk about the Kubernetes Deployment object.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-366"><a id="_idTextAnchor366"/>Kubernetes Deployments</h1>
<p>Kubernetes takes the<a id="_idIndexMarker1427"/> single-responsibility principle very seriously. All Kubernetes objects are designed to do one thing and one thing only, and they are designed to do this one thing very well. In this regard, we must understand Kubernetes ReplicaSets and Deployments. A ReplicaSet, as we have learned, is responsible for achieving and reconciling the desired state of an application service. This means that the ReplicaSet manages a set of pods.</p>
<p>A <strong class="bold">Deployment</strong> augments a ReplicaSet by providing rolling updates and rollback functionality on top of it. In Docker Swarm, the Swarm service incorporates the functionality of both a ReplicaSet and Deployment. In this regard, SwarmKit is much more monolithic than Kubernetes. The following diagram shows the relationship of a Deployment to a ReplicaSet:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.21 – Kubernetes Deployment" height="251" src="img/Figure_16.21_B19199.jpg" width="601"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.21 – Kubernetes Deployment</p>
<p>In the preceding diagram, the<a id="_idIndexMarker1428"/> ReplicaSet defines and governs a set of identical pods. The main characteristics of the ReplicaSet are that it is self-healing, scalable, and always does its best to reconcile the desired state. The Kubernetes Deployment, in turn, adds rolling updates and rollback functionality to this. In this regard, a Deployment is a wrapper object for a ReplicaSet.</p>
<p>We will learn more about rolling updates and rollbacks in <a href="B19199_17.xhtml#_idTextAnchor374"><em class="italic">Chapter 17</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying, Updating, and Securing an Application </em><em class="italic">with Kubernetes</em>.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will learn more about Kubernetes services and how they enable service discovery and routing.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-367"><a id="_idTextAnchor367"/>Kubernetes Services</h1>
<p>The moment we start to<a id="_idIndexMarker1429"/> work with applications consisting of more than one application service, we need service discovery. The following diagram illustrates this problem:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.22 – Service discovery" height="208" src="img/Figure_16.22_B19199.jpg" width="511"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.22 – Service discovery</p>
<p>In the preceding diagram, we have a <code>Web API</code> service that needs access to three other services: <code>payments</code>, <code>shipping</code>, and <code>ordering</code>. The <code>Web API</code> service should never have to care about<a id="_idIndexMarker1430"/> how and where to find those three services. In the API code, we just want to use the name of the service we want to reach and its port number. A sample would be the following URL, <a href="http://payments:3000">http://payments:3000</a>, which is used to access an instance of the <code>payments</code> service.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, the payments application service is represented by a ReplicaSet of pods. Due to the nature of highly distributed systems, we cannot assume that pods have stable endpoints. A pod can come and go on a whim. But that’s a problem if we need to access the corresponding application service from an internal or external client. If we cannot rely on pod endpoints being stable, what else can we do?</p>
<p>This is where <strong class="bold">Kubernetes Services</strong> come into play. They are meant to provide stable endpoints to ReplicaSets or Deployments, as follows:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.23 – Kubernetes service providing stable endpoints to clients" height="463" src="img/Figure_16.23_B19199.jpg" width="391"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.23 – Kubernetes service providing stable endpoints to clients</p>
<p>In the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker1431"/>diagram, in the center, we can see such a Kubernetes Service. It provides a reliable cluster-wide IP address, also called a <code>app=web</code>; that is, all pods that have a label called <code>app</code> with a value of <code>web</code> are proxied.</p>
<p>In the next section, we will learn more about context-based routing and how Kubernetes alleviates this task.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-368"><a id="_idTextAnchor368"/>Context-based routing</h1>
<p>Often, we want to <a id="_idIndexMarker1433"/>configure context-based routing for our Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes offers us various ways to do this. The preferred and most scalable way currently is to use IngressController. The following diagram tries to illustrate how this ingress controller works:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 16.24 – Context-based routing using a Kubernetes ingress controller" height="494" src="img/Figure_16.24_B19199.jpg" width="741"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 16.24 – Context-based routing using a Kubernetes ingress controller</p>
<p>In the preceding diagram, we can see how context-based (or layer 7) routing works when using an IngressController, such as Nginx. Here, we have the Deployment of an application service called <code>web</code>. All the pods of this application service have the following label: <code>app=web</code>. Then, we have a Kubernetes Service called <code>web</code> that provides a stable endpoint to those pods. The Service has a VIP of <code>52.14.0.13</code> and exposes a <code>30044</code> port. That is, if a request comes to any node of the Kubernetes cluster for the name <code>web</code> and <code>30044</code> port, then it is forwarded to this Service. The Service then load balances the request to one of the pods.</p>
<p>So far, so good, but how is an ingress request from a client to the http[s]://example.com/web URL routed to our web service? First, we must define routing from a context-based request to a corresponding <code>&lt;service name&gt;/&lt;port&gt;</code> request. This is done through an Ingress object:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the Ingress object, we define the Host and Path as the source and the (service) name, and the port as the target. When this Ingress object is created by the Kubernetes API server, then a process that runs as a sidecar in IngressController picks up this change.</li>
<li>The configuration file of the Nginx reverse proxy is modified.</li>
<li>By adding the new route, Nginx is then asked to reload its configuration and thus, will be<a id="_idIndexMarker1434"/> able to correctly route any incoming requests to <code>http[s]://example.com/web</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the next section, we are going to compare Docker SwarmKit with Kubernetes by contrasting some of the main resources of each orchestration engine.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-369"><a id="_idTextAnchor369"/>Comparing SwarmKit with Kubernetes</h1>
<p>Now that we<a id="_idIndexMarker1435"/> have learned a lot of details about the most<a id="_idIndexMarker1436"/> important resources in Kubernetes, it is helpful to compare the two orchestrators, SwarmKit and Kubernetes, by matching the important resources. Let’s take a look:</p>

</ol>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-373"><a id="_idTextAnchor373"/>Answers</h1>
<p>Here are some sample answers to the questions presented in this chapter:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Kubernetes cluster consists of a control plane (Kubernetes Master) and several worker nodes. The control plane is responsible for maintaining the desired state of the cluster, such as which applications are running and which container images they use. Worker nodes are the servers where applications are deployed and run.</li>
<li>The Kubernetes master is responsible for managing the cluster. All requests to create objects, reschedule pods, manage ReplicaSets, and more happen on the master. The master does not run the application workload in a production or production-like cluster.</li>
<li>On each worker node, we have the kubelet, the proxy, and container runtime.</li>
<li>The answer is <em class="italic">A. True</em>. You cannot run standalone containers on a Kubernetes cluster. Pods are the atomic units of Deployment in such a cluster.</li>
<li>A Kubernetes pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It can run one or multiple co-located containers. Here are three main characteristics:<ol><li>A pod can encapsulate multiple containers that are tightly coupled and need to share resources.</li><li>All containers in a pod share the same network namespace, meaning they can communicate with each other using <code>localhost</code>.</li><li>Each pod has a unique IP address within the cluster.</li></ol></li>
<li>All containers running inside a pod share the same Linux kernel network namespace. Thus, all processes running inside those containers can communicate with each other through <code>localhost</code> in a similar way to how processes or applications directly running on the host can communicate with each other through <code>localhost</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>pause</code> container’s sole role is to reserve the namespaces of the pod for containers that run in it.</li>
<li>This is a bad idea since all containers of a pod are co-located, which means they run on the same cluster node. Also, if multiple containers run in the same pod, they can only be scaled up or down all at once. However, the different components of the application (that is, <code>web</code>, <code>inventory</code>, and <code>db</code>) usually have very different requirements concerning scalability or resource consumption. The <code>web</code> component might need to be scaled up and down depending on the traffic and the <code>db</code> component, in turn, has special requirements regarding storage that the others don’t have. If we do run every component in its own pod, we are much more flexible in this regard.</li>
<li>We need a mechanism to run multiple instances of a pod in a cluster and make sure that the actual number of pods running always corresponds to the desired number, even when individual pods crash or disappear due to network partitions or cluster node failures. The ReplicaSet is the mechanism that provides scalability and self-healing to any application service.</li>
<li>We need Deployment objects whenever we want to update an application service in a Kubernetes cluster without causing downtime to the service. Deployment objects add rolling updates and rollback capabilities to ReplicaSets.</li>
<li>A Kubernetes Service is an abstract way to expose an application running on a set of pods as a network service. The main responsibilities of a Kubernetes service include the following:<ol><li>Providing a stable IP address and DNS name to the set of pods, helping in the discovery, and allowing for load balancing</li><li>Routing network traffic to distribute it across a set of pods provides the same functionality</li><li>Allowing for the exposure of services to external clients if necessary</li></ol></li>
<li>Kubernetes Service objects are used to make application services participate in Service discovery. They provide a stable endpoint to a set of pods (normally governed by a ReplicaSet or a Deployment). Kube services are abstractions that define a logical set of pods and a policy regarding how to access them. There are four types of Kube Services:<ul><li><code>30000</code> to <code>32767</code> on every cluster node.</li><li><strong class="bold">LoadBalancer</strong>: This type exposes the application service externally using a cloud provider’s load balancer, such as ELB on AWS.</li><li><strong class="bold">ExternalName</strong>: Used when you need to define a proxy for a cluster’s external service such as a database.</li></ul></li>
<li>To create a Kubernetes Service, you typically create a service configuration file (<code>YAML</code> or <code>JSON</code>) that specifies the desired service type (e.g., ClusterIP for internal communication), and selector labels to identify the target pods and the ports for network traffic. This file is then applied using the <code>kubectl apply</code> command. This creates a service that routes traffic across the set of pods matching the selector labels.</li>
</ol>
