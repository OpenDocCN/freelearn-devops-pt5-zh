    3.9 has been just released. OCP 3.9 is significantly different from the other
    releases, in that the earlier versions of OpenShift were one step behind a version
    of Kubernetes, meaning that OpenShift 3.5 was using Kubernetes 1.6, and OpenShift
    3.7 was using Kubernetes 1.8\. This is the main reason why Red Hat skipped version
    3.8 and jumped right to 3.9, syncing up with Kubernetes 1.9\. This does not mean
    that OpenShift 3.8 has been renamed 3.9, in fact, it is quite the opposite. OpenShift
    3.9 includes all the new features from both 3.8 and 3.9, which includes the following:'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Prometheus cluster monitoring in conjunction with the Admin Web Console and
    operator **lifecycle manager** (**LCM**) features is going to make life easier
    for a *lazy* OpenShift admin, giving them a nice, easy to use and configured web
    console, functional enough to complete most of the tasks from a web interface.
    This is just one of the features that these projects are going to add together,
    but there is going to be so much more than that.

    meshing to the next level by using on-demand service connections. Therefore, there
    will no longer be a need to provision such things manually.
  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the greatest things we are going to see in the future releases is seamless
    and easy to perform cluster upgrades and cluster scaling. What this means is that
    currently, we can only remove OpenShift nodes from the cluster without rebooting
    or restarting master nodes, but this is not the case with adding a new node. The
    process of adding a new node is not that fast nor always easy. So, what we are
    going to see in the upcoming releases is an ability to use *golden* images and
    the ability to add them to the cluster on the fly.

- en: Integration with the OpenStack **Infrastructure as a service** (**IaaS**) platform
    is going to be closer to reality. We are going to see how OpenShift on OpenStack
    deployments can leverage this type of deployment by utilizing underlying OpenStack
    platform services like **L****oad Balancer as a Service** (**LBaaS**), **F****irewall
    as a Service** (**FWaaS**), **DNS as a Service** (**DNSaaS**), and so on, alongside
    further integration with tested and certified Neutron plugins, as well as bare
    metal servers provisioning and management through Ironic.

    with an OCP:'

    CoreOS has a really small footprint, it''s lightweight, and has minimum functionality,
    which is enough to run containers and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.'

    containers and Kubernetes, which allows you to run several instances of Quay to
    ensure redundancy out of the box. Quay also has a geo-replication feature available
    that allows seamless synchronization of your container images between different
    data centers. One of the other most important features of Quay is automatic container
    scanning for security vulnerabilities. This is one of the most requested security
    features in the container industry. Quay also has a continuous integration feature,
    which allows you to build and push images when developers commit the code, automatically.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '**Tectonic**: This is a container orchestration platform by CoreOS, which works
    similarly to the OCP, but has a lot less functionality compared to OpenShift.
    The uniqueness of Tectonic is that its control plane services are running inside
    the Kubernetes service that Tectonic is managing. This is a classic chicken or
    the egg situation that CoreOS managed to solve.'

    one way or the other migrated to or merged with the OCP. The whole of 2018 is
    probably going to be a little bit hectic for the OCP development team due to the
    recent acquisition of CoreOS. These teams are going to work together to decide
    which features to move forward with and which of them to let go forever. But no
    matter what, it is all going to benefit OpenShift and make it the most successful
    container management platform of all time.
