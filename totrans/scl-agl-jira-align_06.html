		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Chapter 4</em>: Team Challenges</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we concentrate on team-level agile, the foundation for scaling to the enterprise. Now more than ever, it's prudent to invest in your teams, their agile methods, and the tools that support them. Traditionally, teams have harnessed the power of colocation for effective face-to-face communication and collaboration (<em class="italic">Agile Manifesto</em>, Principle 6). One of the biggest challenges facing teams today is maintaining high performance and relentless improvement while fully remote and geographically dispersed due to various constraints, including the current global pandemic. Tools are now essential to support team planning, collaboration, and execution. Luckily, the Atlassian suite of products excels in this arena. While Jira Software is the central tool for team agility, Jira Align provides added features to help teams plan and collaborate, even when geographically dispersed. You will learn how teams connect and engage with Jira Align. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ensuring teams are connected</li>
				<li>Sizing stories with estimation games</li>
				<li>Loading sprints during remote planning</li>
				<li>Conducting ceremonies and meetings</li>
				<li><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Reviewing sprints and giving shoutouts</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Ensuring teams are connected</h1>
			<p>Agile<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> teams are where the rubber meets the road, where the work of the connected knowledge enterprise gets done. Sprint after sprint, they focus with precision on delivering small batches of high-ranking user stories and shippable product increments of value to real customers. With Jira Software as their central collaborative workflow engine, they are able to hook into a variety of tools, including Bitbucket for version control and Bamboo for continuous integration and deployment. To put their work in context, teams can reference data like program increments and <strong class="bold">Why?</strong> button details pushed down from Jira Align while their work item statuses sync with Jira Align for rolled-up reporting. </p>
			<p>Team members <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>using Jira Software are considered <em class="italic">integrated users</em> of Jira Align, which allows their data to sync with Align and for them to access Align's team-level functionality. To ensure that team members flow in from Jira Software, the Jira Align administrator must first go to <strong class="bold">Jira Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Setup</strong> and set <strong class="bold">Allow Jira to add users to team if they belong to an issue</strong> to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> under the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> section. Note, however, that this setting could result in a duplicate user record if an integrated user was previously set up in Jira Align. To prevent duplicates, the user's email address in Jira Software must be exposed so that Jira Align can combine the integrated and native user accounts. As of the time of writing, a security issue prevents this from happening automatically.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">It is required to expose email addresses in Jira Software so that Jira Align can combine duplicate user accounts.</p>
			<p class="callout">In Atlassian Cloud, Jira Software users can expose their email by clicking on their profile picture, selecting <strong class="bold">Account settings</strong>, and then setting their email address to be visible by <strong class="bold">Anyone</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout">In Jira Server/Data Center, the Jira administrator can set this globally by going to <strong class="bold">Jira Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">System</strong> | <strong class="bold">General Configuration</strong> and then setting <strong class="bold">User email visibility</strong> to <strong class="bold">Public</strong>.</p>
			<p>The Jira Align administrator can also set the default system role for integrated users by going to <strong class="bold">Jira Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Setup</strong> and selecting a role for <strong class="bold">Default System Role for New User(s)</strong>. We recommend selecting the <strong class="bold">Team Leads</strong> role for slightly more access than the <strong class="bold">Team Members</strong> role, including the ability to use the Team Meetings module we will discuss shortly.</p>
			<p>In addition to integrated user access, it is common good practice for product owners and often scrum masters to have full Jira Align licenses in order to access program-level functionality, which we will cover in <a href="B16328_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Program Planning Challenges</em>. We recommend that both roles have full licenses because they often work closely with product managers and RTEs at the<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> program level and we've found that the ability to access higher-level functionality allows them to easily pivot and fill any gaps between program and team. For example, POs may help product managers break portfolio epics down into features, align on cross-program dependencies, and manage program risks. Scrum masters represent their teams at scrum of scrums meetings, work to remove impediments, coordinate with the RTE, escalate issues and risks, and align on dependencies at the program level.</p>
			<p>Both the <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>PO and SM are emailed automatically when dependencies are requested of their teams. This ensures that they are in the loop even if the requesting team did not speak with them first, as would be expected. Note that this applies mainly to feature dependencies. Story dependencies are generally handled within Jira using the issue linking functionality.</p>
			<p>Now that team-level users are connected, they have the option to log on to Jira Align to use team tools not available in Jira. We'll first explore how to size stories with estimation games.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Sizing stories with estimation games</h1>
			<p>Estimation, the process <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>of predicting the most realistic effort required to deliver work items based on incomplete and uncertain input, is a typical challenge among development teams. Agile frameworks leverage relative estimating to mitigate this challenge. The power of relative estimating lies in accuracy over precision. If we were to ask you to look out the window and tell us how tall two buildings across the street are, chances are you couldn't give precise heights in feet or meters, but you could accurately state that one building is twice as tall as the other. Relative estimating allows teams to do the same thing with user stories. For reference, they start with a small, simple, and well-understood story (typically something that their team could build, test, and deploy in a day) and call it a 1-point story. They then estimate other stories relative to the 1-point story. For<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> example, are they 2, 3, 5, or 8 times the volume, complexity, and uncertainty of the 1-point story?</p>
			<p>Teams typically <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>use the modified Fibonacci sequence to size stories, as it factors in the inherent uncertainty of larger work items: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, and 100. Think of the point sizes as buckets. If a story won't fit into a given size, try the next largest bucket. Note that it's best practice for teams to split any stories larger than an 8 or 13 into smaller stories before accepting them as ready to be worked on in a sprint.</p>
			<p>Now is where the fun comes in. In his 2005 book, <em class="italic">Agile Estimating and Planning</em>, Mike Cohn popularized a game called planning poker, wherein each team member has a set of cards with Fibonacci numbers for voting on the size of stories. Facilitated by the SM, with story context and clarifications provided by the PO, teams vote, discuss the high and low votes, uncover new information, and revote until they converge on the team's estimate for each story.</p>
			<p>Jira Align's <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>estimation games module allows geographically dispersed<a id="_idIndexMarker187"/> teams to play planning poker remotely. While this can be done using the chat feature, we recommend that a voice conference bridge be open for these critical conversations. Note too that teams play planning poker at various times. We recommend, at a minimum, playing at a backlog refinement session in advance of sprint planning. The reason is that if you wait until sprint planning, there's not enough time for the PO to adjust priorities based on the latest size estimates.</p>
			<p>To access the<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> estimation games, go to <strong class="bold">Team | Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Estimation</strong> from the navigation menu. You can also access them by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Estimations</strong> button in the upper-right corner of the <strong class="bold">Team Meetings</strong> page. This will bring you to the following screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.1_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Jira Align estimation games"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – Jira Align estimation games</p>
			<p>Next, select the <strong class="bold">Level of Effort Poker</strong> option on the left to play traditional planning poker for sizing stories. There is also a <strong class="bold">Level of Effort Poker</strong> option and a simple list format option for quick entry of both effort and value.</p>
			<p>It's important to note that the story points field is labeled <strong class="bold">LOE</strong> (<strong class="bold">level of effort</strong>) on story details panels in Jira Align. There may also be a field labeled <strong class="bold">LOV</strong> (<strong class="bold">level of value</strong>). Since value <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>scores at the story level are not a standard agile practice, we recommend that the Jira Align administrator toggle off LOV under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Details Panels Settings</strong>. The LOV functionality predates the current standard of capturing planned and actual business value at the program level, which we will cover in <a href="B16328_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Program Planning Challenges</em>.</p>
			<p>Once a game begins, it is shown with a red <code>Baltimore COR_S23</code> sprint is live. There, you can see that recent games are also displayed. </p>
			<p>To start a game, select the <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>program increment, program, team, and the active team sprint to drive the set of stories to be estimated:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.2_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – Jira Align estimation games, sprint selection"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – Jira Align estimation games, sprint selection</p>
			<p>Next, select one of two ways to play: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Play Using Stories</strong>: Choose this option to estimate stories from any sprint, including the unassigned backlog. You will need to select a set of stories to start the estimation game.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Play Using Sprint</strong>: Choose this option to estimate stories already assigned to your selected team and sprint. This will select all the applicable stories related to the chosen team sprint.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The individual who starts the planning poker game is called a <strong class="bold">dealer</strong>. The dealer has the following special <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>game rights:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The dealer can select a <strong class="bold">Story</strong> from the list on the left (see <em class="italic">Figure 4.3</em>). After the dealer selects a story, they discuss it with the team. The team members then vote with the cards at the bottom of the page or click on the <strong class="bold">Pass</strong> button. They can view assumptions, details of the story, discussions related to the story, or acceptance criteria by clicking the corresponding buttons at the top of the table, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.3_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – Jira Align estimation games, story voting"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – Jira Align estimation games, story voting</p>
			<p>The dealer can skip the voting round for a player by clicking <strong class="bold">Pass</strong> above a user's poker card. In the event that a team member's connection goes down or they get pulled away for any reason, this allows the dealer to maintain good housekeeping and keep the game rolling.</p>
			<p>Once the team members have voted, the dealer<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> can save the vote by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Save it!</strong> button on the table, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.4_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 – Jira Align estimation games, saving the vote"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4 – Jira Align estimation games, saving the vote</p>
			<p>If a consensus was not reached, the team can repeat the voting by clicking <strong class="bold">Play Again</strong> on the table. After the second or third round of voting, the dealer can set an estimation as final based on a discussion with the team by clicking <strong class="bold">Final</strong> above the card with the correct number.</p>
			<p>During the game, the dealer role may be passed at any time to another team member attending the game. To pass the role, select the <strong class="bold">Pass Dealer Role</strong> button in the top right, and then select the name of the team member in the participant list that appears. To exit the game, click on the <strong class="bold">Exit</strong> button in the upper-right corner of the page.</p>
			<p>Now that our stories are sized, the team is ready to load them into sprints during remote planning. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Loading sprints during remote planning</h1>
			<p>Another great feature<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/> to help with dispersed team planning is the backlog kanban, in sprint view. It provides scrum teams with an easy way to load sprints<a id="_idIndexMarker194"/> according to their capacity during PI planning team brea<a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>kouts. Teams<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/> typically begin their first breakout by estimating their capacity for each sprint of the PI based on their historical velocity (visible in either Jira Align or Jira Software) and their availability during the PI, factoring in things such as holidays, vacations, and training. They then identify and size the work items likely needed to implement the program's top prioritized features and begin loading them into upcoming sprints.</p>
			<p>Jira Align's backlog kanban in sprint view allows stories and tasks to be dragged from the unassigned backlog on the right into the program increment's sprint columns on the left, keeping track of load against the capacity for each sprint. To begin, select your PI in the configuration bar, then go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Teams</strong> |<strong class="bold"> Backlog</strong>. Be sure that <strong class="bold">Story Backlog</strong> is selected in the <strong class="bold">Viewing</strong> dropdown at the top left of the workspace. Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Kanban</strong> button near the top right of the workspace and then select <strong class="bold">Sprint View</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.5_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5 – Jira Align backlog kanban button"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5 – Jira Align backlog kanban button</p>
			<p>The backlog kanban in sprint view will now be displayed in the workspace. Next, click in the <strong class="bold">Selected Sprints</strong> box and add the sprints you wish to plan for the PI:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.6_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – Jira Align backlog kanban, sprint view"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6 – Jira Align backlog kanban, sprint view</p>
			<p>Here, we have <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>selected five sprints in <code>PI-5</code>. Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Unassigned Backlog</strong> button near the top right of the workspace. This will open a panel on the right showing stories that are not yet assigned to sprints, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.7_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7 – Jira Align unassigned backlog panel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7 – Jira Align unassigned backlog panel</p>
			<p>Now, team <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>members can drag stories from the <strong class="bold">Unassigned Backlog</strong> on the right into the program increment's sprint columns on the left. The tops of the columns show the total story points loaded into the sprint next to the team's average velocity for the previous five sprints. This provides a good visual indicator of how realistic the load is for each sprint. In <em class="italic">Figure 4.7</em>, we see that the first sprint column has a red bar indicating an overloaded sprint. An <strong class="bold">Override</strong> button allows teams to overwrite the average velocity with the capacity figures they derived based on availability and other factors:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.8_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.8 – Jira Align sprint capacity"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8 – Jira Align sprint capacity</p>
			<p>Let's drag <strong class="bold">Story 8787 </strong>from the unassigned backlog and add it to the second sprint column. Notice that the points loaded increased to <strong class="bold">80</strong>, still within the <strong class="bold">83</strong>-point average velocity for the past 5 sprints:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.9_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9 – Jira Align backlog kanban"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9 – Jira Align backlog kanban</p>
			<p>In this way, each<a id="_idIndexMarker198"/> team can load their sprints for the program increment. Once the sprints are loaded and PI planning is complete, teams are ready to execute sprints and conduct ceremonies.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">What does it take to work as a kanban team in Jira Align? High performing and disciplined agile teams often use kanban to deliver a steady stream of work items independent of size or timebox. Rather than velocity, these teams focus on cycle time and throughput as their performance measures.</p>
			<p class="callout">Jira Align allows your programs to have a mix of scrum and kanban teams. While kanban teams may not size their work items (their metrics are based on item count regardless of size), it is recommended to apply a standard size to their items, such as one point each, for the purposes of roll-up reporting.</p>
			<p class="callout">To connect a kanban team's board to Jira Align, the Jira Align administrator must add the kanban board under the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Connectors</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Management</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Boards</strong> tab. This will create the Jira Align team as a kanban team type.</p>
			<p class="callout">To set the default size for kanban teams' work items, go to <strong class="bold">Teams</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Teams</strong> from the navigation menu and select the team to open its details slide-out panel. Next, enable the <strong class="bold">Auto-populate Estimate</strong> toggle and select a value to automatically apply to work items created and assigned to the team.</p>
			<p class="callout">While kanban teams' work items are not tied to sprints, they are still connected to program increments via the features to which their stories are linked. They can also target features for delivery in a given sprint on the program board. In this way, they can communicate using the common sprint cadence of the program, even though they do not start and stop sprints during the program increment.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Conducting ceremonies and meetings</h1>
			<p>Predictability is a general delivery challenge that agile frameworks such as scrum seek to address. The cadence of sprints makes events such as planning and retrospectives predictable, and synchronization allows multiple perspectives to be explored and integrated concurrently. The key events that drive cadence and synchronization are known as <em class="italic">ceremonies</em> and<a id="_idIndexMarker199"/> they are integral to success as an agile team.</p>
			<p>Jira Align provides tools to facilitate and conduct interactive meetings remotely. Simply go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Team</strong> | <strong class="bold">Team Meetings</strong> to open the Jira Align meetings workspace:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.10_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.10 – Jira Align meetings"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10 – Jira Align meetings</p>
			<p>Here you can manage team <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>meetings and launch retrospectives and estimation games. Once you set your program and program increment in the configuration bar, there are two meeting views available:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">List</strong>: Displays all team-level sprint meetings on a timeline. You can filter the list view further according to meeting types, a date range, or list only today's meetings.</li>

			<p>In the preceding screenshot, meetings<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> for the <code>Baltimore</code> team in the <code>Mobile</code> program during <code>PI-5</code> are displayed on the calendar. To switch to a different team, simply select another team from the dropdown in the top left of the workspace. While in calendar view, you can also click on the <strong class="bold">Calendar Matrix</strong> button near the top right of the workspace to display a tracking grid of sprint planning, review, and retrospective ceremonies for the entire program.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Sprint planning</h2>
			<p>The sprint planning ceremony<a id="_idIndexMarker202"/> takes place at the inception of every sprint. It is a timeboxed, collaborative session for the entire team to define what will be delivered in the sprint and how it will be achieved.</p>
			<p>To begin, locate the sprint planning meeting in the list or calendar view and then click on the <strong class="bold">Start Meeting</strong> button. For a meeting that has already started, you can click on the <strong class="bold">Continue Meeting</strong> button.</p>

			</ul>
			<p>You can complete the meeting by clicking on the <strong class="bold">End Meeting</strong> button in the top-right corner of the workspace. It will prompt you to end the meeting and, if required, you can send the sprint planning meeting notes via email.</p>
			<p>Now that the sprint is planned, let's explore how the team drives sprint execution with a daily collaborative synchronization meeting.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Daily standup</h2>
			<p>The daily scrum, often called a standup, provides a daily opportunity for the team to synchronize on work activities. This meeting is for the team, not for managers to obtain status. Visitors may observe in the spirit of openness, one of scrum's five core values. The meeting is timeboxed with a recommended limit of 15 minutes. Each team member shares a quick update on what they completed yesterday, what they commit to completing today, and what issues are blocking them. The scrum master will note impediments and sometimes schedule a quick follow-on meeting for a deeper dive into urgent issues.</p>
			<p>To begin, locate the daily standup meeting<a id="_idIndexMarker205"/> for a given date in the meetings list or calendar view and then click on the <strong class="bold">Start Meeting</strong> button. For a meeting that has already started, you can click on the <strong class="bold">View Meeting</strong> button. For a meeting that has ended, it will display a meeting summary.</p>
			<p>Once you click <strong class="bold">Start Meeting</strong>, it will open the daily standup meeting page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			</ul>
			<p>Click on the <strong class="bold">End Meeting</strong> button to end the daily standup meeting.</p>
			<p>Now that the team has executed the sprint, it's time to review what they delivered.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Sprint review</h2>
			<p>The sprint review<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> is a timeboxed meeting, generally between 1 and 4 hours, that takes place at the end of each sprint and is attended by the team and stakeholders. During the meeting, the PO or team members demonstrate the working product features completed during the sprint. The focus is on <em class="italic">what</em> they delivered, not <em class="italic">how</em> they delivered it.</p>
			<p>To begin, locate the sprint review meeting in the meetings list or calendar view and then click on the <strong class="bold">Start Meeting</strong> button. For a meeting that has already started, you can click on the <strong class="bold">View Meeting</strong> button.</p>

			<p>Now that the team has reviewed <em class="italic">what</em> they delivered during the sprint, it's time to reflect on <em class="italic">how</em> they delivered it, for continuous learning and improvement purposes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Retrospectives</h2>
			<p>As part of the sprint cadence, teams <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>take time to reflect on how to become more efficient and effective, openly sharing ideas for adjustments and improvements (<em class="italic">Agile Manifesto</em>, Principle 12). This takes place during a timeboxed sprint retrospective, occurring after the sprint review and prior to the next sprint planning event. In Jira Align, the retrospective is timeboxed to 1 hour and you may restart the meeting if more time is required. During the retrospective, the team will often create improvement backlog items to be implemented in the next sprint.</p>
			<p>There are several retrospective formats and we recommend varying them to keep team engagement high and fresh ideas coming each sprint. The most basic retrospective format is for the team to discuss the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What went well</li>
				<li>What could be improved</li>
				<li>What they commit to improving in the next sprint</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To begin, click on the <strong class="bold">Retrospectives</strong> button in the top-right corner of the meetings workspace. This will open the team retrospective dashboard, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Here, you will select the program increment and sprint, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Start A Retrospective</strong> button to launch the retrospective room shown in the following screenshot. The meeting is created with a series of time-boxed agenda items and allows team members to share and<a id="_idIndexMarker213"/> collaborate interactively:</p>

			<p>Here are the retrospective meeting steps, as shown on the left side of the retrospective room:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gather the team</strong>: Start the retrospective meeting once the team joins.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Review prior sprint</strong>: Displays action items from the previous sprint retrospective. The facilitator marks them complete if done.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Poll sentiment</strong>: The team votes on how they felt about the sprint (covering teamwork, attitude, and improvement). The scale is 1 to 5, where 1 is the best and 5 is the worst.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Poll results</strong>: The team votes on how they performed (covering quality, predictability, and delivery). The scale is 1 to 5, where 1 is the best and 5 is the worst.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Discuss splits</strong>: Discuss the reasons for stories being split during the sprint (for example, due to underestimating the size) and ideas on how to avoid splits.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gather feedback</strong>: Collect feedback on what went well and what did not go well during the sprint.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Make suggestions</strong>: Explore and share ideas that the team could implement in the next sprint to improve performance and overall team satisfaction.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Vote on actions</strong>: The team votes on action items for improvement. The scale is 1 to 10, where 10 is awesome and 1 is bad.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Agree on plan</strong>: The team agrees on action items for improvement in the next sprint. As a minimum, 1, and up to 3 items, will be selected.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Final report</strong>: End the retrospective and share the meeting summary notes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At the end of the<a id="_idIndexMarker214"/> meeting, Jira Align generates a retrospective summary report. You can access this by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Retro Team Results</strong> link on the retrospective dashboard. You can also access the team review meeting and survey results by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Survey + Team Review</strong> link.</p>
			<p>Now that we have learned how to facilitate ceremonies in Jira Align, let's explore how to produce measures of the teams' delivery and predictability and how to celebrate teams and individuals for their great work.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Reviewing sprints and giving shoutouts</h1>
			<p>When reviewing<a id="_idIndexMarker215"/> team performance, some key metrics to consider are team happiness, committed versus delivered, and predictability. While burndowns and velocity are important for teams to review in Jira, the Jira Align sprint metrics (M1) report provides scrum masters, RTEs, team leads, and others with a way to see sprint-by-sprint metrics for an entire program increment. It's a useful report to review with teams during sprint planning or retrospectives. It helps teams see how they are progressing toward team and program goals for the PI. The focus of the report is on team delivery and predictability, not on velocity or comparing teams to one another. To get the most out of this report, teams must use the ceremonies within the Jira Align meetings module, as discussed earlier.</p>
			<p>To begin, go to the <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>navigation bar and select <strong class="bold">Teams</strong> | <strong class="bold">Track</strong> | <strong class="bold">Sprint Metrics</strong> (<strong class="bold">M1</strong>). This will open the M1 report, as shown in the following screenshot. The report can be run for a single team by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Extra Configs</strong> button in the top right of the workspace, or for all teams in the program. The report can be saved and shared outside the tool by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Capture</strong> button in the top-right corner, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.19_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 4.19 – Jira Align sprint metrics M1 report"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.19 – Jira Align sprint metrics M1 report</p>
			<p>The M1 report displays a series of metric grids. Here we describe each metric, color indicators if applicable, and any prerequisites for populating the grid. Some metric grids, as noted, allow you to open the sprint coaching report, which highlights variances between what was committed for the sprint versus what was delivered, a useful tool for scrum masters in their role as agile coaches. Note, you would need to scroll down to see all grids.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team emotion</strong>: Displays an indicator of team happiness during each sprint using the analogy of a weather report (sunny, partly cloudy, or cloudy). Prerequisite: Team emotion captured during the sprint review.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team objectives</strong>: Displays a percentage metric (# objectives completed / # objectives planned per sprint). Prerequisites: The team created sprint objectives during sprint planning and voted on sprint objective completeness during the sprint review. Green = 100% or greater, orange 85% to 99%, and red &lt; 85%. Click any colored cell to open the sprint coaching report.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Story completion</strong>: Displays a percentage metric (# stories completed / # stories planed per sprint). Green = 100% or greater, orange 85% to 99%, and red &lt; 85%. Click any colored cell to open the sprint coaching report.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Planned vs accepted</strong>: Displays a percentage metric (# points completed / # points planned per sprint). Green = 100% or greater, orange 85% to 99%, and red &lt; 85%. Click any colored cell to open the sprint coaching report.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Splits and drops</strong>: Displays the sum of all splits (when stories are split, usually due to incompleteness at the end of a sprint) and drops (when stories are dropped from the sprint by <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>moving them to the backlog or next sprint). White = 0 splits or drops, orange = 1 split or drop, and red &gt; 1 split or drop. Click any colored cell to open the sprint coaching report.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team defects</strong>: Displays the sum of defects regardless of state. White = 0 defects, orange = 1 defect, and red &gt; 1 defect. Click any colored cell to open the sprint coaching report.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Goal state</strong>: Indicates whether the sprint goal was met. Prerequisites: The team defined the sprint goals during sprint planning and voted on whether the goal was met during the sprint review. The sprint goals themselves are displayed in a grid below the goal state metric grid.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sprint completion</strong>: Indicates<a id="_idIndexMarker218"/> whether the sprint was marked as complete. Prerequisite: Team marked the sprint as complete during the sprint review.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we know the data captured in the M1 report grids, let's take a look at the Sprint Coaching report (also known as the Sprint Wrap-Up report) that is accessible by clicking on the cells in many of the grids as noted above. This report is beneficial to scrum masters, product owners, and team members for assessing if the overall goal of the sprint was achieved. It details the team plan at the beginning of the sprint in contrast with the final result, and may be helpful to review with stakeholders during the Sprint Review. Click on the colored indicator cells on the M1 report or go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Teams | Track | Sprint Coaching</strong> to open the report, shown in the next screenshot.</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.20 – Jira Align sprint coaching report</p>
			<p>Here we see sections for the following information. Note, you would need to scroll down to see all the sections.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sprint Goal/Objectives</strong>: Displays the sprint goal and objectives.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Committed Plan</strong>: Details the commitments made during sprint planning, including the number of user stories, initial Development and QA task hours, and effort and value points.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Core Team</strong>: Lists the team members. Click or hover over a photo to see the team member's name and role.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">The Statistics</strong><strong class="bold">:</strong><p><strong class="bold">Burndown</strong> chart shows how task hours are burned down in the sprint compared to the ideal. If the sprint is not yet complete, the Estimated Remaining Burn is shown.</p><p><strong class="bold">Velocity</strong> chart displays the velocity for the team over the past several sprints.</p><p><strong class="bold">Standup</strong> <strong class="bold">Attendance</strong> displays the attendance at the interactive meetings available within Jira Align.</p><p><strong class="bold">Rate of Completion</strong> shows the Dev Complete stories in orange and the Test Complete stories in blue.</p><p><strong class="bold">Sprint Story Progress</strong>: Click on <strong class="bold">Show Details</strong> to view the overall sprint story progress. You see the progress bars, story health, and acceptance criteria. Value points, effort points, and the total number of hours spent are also shown here.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Final Score</strong>: Shows what was delivered in terms of stories, quality metrics, and unburned task hours.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Weather Forecast</strong>: Shows how the team feels about upcoming sprints. The weather prediction is set using the interactive Sprint Review meeting within Jira Align.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The report paints an overall picture of the sprint: Were commitments met? What was delivered? How is team velocity tracking? How is the team emotion trending? Having the various charts and graphs handy can enable the team to make adjustments in the upcoming sprint. For example, you may need to adjust the amount of points/task hours in future sprints or add more resources to increase velocity.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and Tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">Teams will generally refer to the Velocity Chart in Jira Software, which shows actual versus committed velocity across several sprints. For an alternate visualization that shows velocity variance (velocity of a sprint divided by the velocity of the previous sprint) over time, try Jira Align's Velocity Variance report by going to the navigation menu, clicking on the search icon (magnifying glass), and then searching for "<code>Velocity Variance</code>."</p>
			<p>Now that we've reviewed how the team delivered in the sprint, let's acknowledge the collective and individual contributions that stood out. An important part of team synergy and collaboration is acknowledging individual and team accomplishments such as company anniversaries and performance awards. This is done in the Shout Out module. To access it, go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Team</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Shout-Outs</strong>.</p>
			<p>On the left side of the workspace, as shown in the next image, you will see three sections to view awards: <strong class="bold">Shout-outs</strong> lists the awards by the name of the award, <strong class="bold">People</strong> lists the awards by recipient, and <strong class="bold">Year</strong> lists the awards by year. At the top of the workspace, there are three buttons to display awards: The <strong class="bold">Feed</strong> button displays the most recent awards, <strong class="bold">My Shout-Outs</strong> displays all awards earned by you, and <strong class="bold">Leaderboard</strong> displays a hall of fame for award recipients ordered by award points earned. You can view all available awards by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Shout-Out Awards</strong> List link in the top left corner:</p>

			<p>Shout-outs create <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>a sense of gamification and encourage teams to strive and do better. As illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 1.1</em>, <em class="italic">Alignment toward transformation by connecting strategy with execution</em>, shout-outs further shape the culture and contribute to a continuous learning organization.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed common challenges faced by geographically dispersed teams in today's world and how Jira Align can help keep teams connected through collaborative team tools. We looked at some key features that aid team agile practices, such as remote planning poker, sprint planning, and other ceremonies. We then explored how these ceremonies drive sprint execution and the resulting metrics that help guide delivery and predictability. Lastly, we learned how to recognize individuals in Jira Align for their contributions and give shout-outs to increase team morale.</p>
			<p>In the next two chapters, we shift from teams to teams of teams. There we will unfold common challenges faced at this higher level and how Jira Align answers them by enabling effective agile planning and execution at the program level.</p>
