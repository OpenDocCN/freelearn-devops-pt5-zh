<p>Application monitoring is the simple process of keeping track of various aspects of an application and how they are performing. It is very important for consistent quality checks and improvement, and it is important for finding out problems in an application before it gets to users.</p>
<p>Application monitoring will not only let us know the performance of an application and issues within it, but will also keep records of the status of its related databases and APIs.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll be discussing various methods for application monitoring. Here are the high-level topics that we'll be covering in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>API level monitoring and various tools for API monitoring</li>
<li>Monitoring the application with Test Cloud</li>
<li>Monitoring the application using Android monitoring tools</li>
</ul>

                </header>

<p><strong>Application Programming Interfaces</strong> (<strong>APIs</strong>) are an integral part of today's integrated development environments. They can also be understood through the client-server relationship, where the mobile app is the client requesting a resource and the API is at the server side and has a URL for any application that wants to make a request.</p>
<p>Most applications share common APIs between web and mobile. APIs are a great way of providing consistent operating behavior across different platforms. It also helps share the same business and data layer operations between different mobile application platforms, so you can use the same APIs for iOS, Android, and web applications.</p>
<p>APIs are so important in the development of a mobile application that it becomes equally critical to monitor APIs to ensure high availability. If an API goes down, the entire application can stop working and the user might not be able to perform any operation that requires the API to be available, which usually is any server operation, though not offline.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>APIs are a very important part of any kind of app, be it a mobile or web application. APIs are used extensively in projects nowadays to provide more flexibility in the way the client (mobile app or web app) interacts with the server-side business logic and data access layers. Because applications are so dependent on APIs to perform operations for the user, it is critical to have API monitoring in place to avoid any kind of downtime or bad user experience. When proper API monitoring is not in place, it can compromise the quality of the application and response times, and sometimes even result in application downtime.</p>
<p>Also, it is very important to monitor APIs not only that you are developing, but also third-party ones that you might be using in the application.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>When monitoring APIs, there are some key points or areas that need to be covered to ensure availability:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API availability</strong>: We need to make sure the API is available; sometimes the server might be down for some reason or the connection can be interrupted based on location and server</li>
<li><strong>Quality of response</strong>: When we call an API, what is the quality of the response returned from the APIâ€”is it according to the agreement or not?</li>
<li><strong>Response time</strong>: What is the response time to get a result when calling the API</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>It is also a good idea for an application developer to keep in mind that APIs might not be available some of the time, and write code in a way that handles these kinds of situations gracefully. Even when the application is not able to perform some API operations, if it informs the user in a nice way, it can help the user experience much more than facing runtime exceptions. Write code to handle API exceptions and scenarios where the API does not respond.</p>

<p>You learned about Xamarin Test Cloud in previous chapters and how to use it for continuous testing in the continuous integration life cycle. Here, we will discuss in more detail how to use Xamarin Test Cloud and the analytics it provides after running an application on different sets of devices.</p>
<p>We will be using two different applications here to see the monitoring analytics and compare them, to get a better understanding of how this helps us identify various performance and functionality-related issues in our application.</p>
<p>These are the applications we will be using for the walkthrough:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>PhoneCallApp</strong> (the application we developed in previous chapters)</li>
<li><strong>Xamarin Store</strong> (a sample Android application provided by Test Cloud)</li>
</ul>
<p>Xamarin Test Cloud can help us identify applications' functionality-related issues on real devices.</p>
<p>It is a great source of application monitoring in terms of testing on different mobile devices and with different versions of operating systems.</p>
<p>Getting a detailed analysis of various applications' functions is very important to make sure our application is running as expected on our target devices.</p>
<p>With that being said, it is also critical to the application to be able to run on different operating system versions, and to analyze how it performs and how much memory usage it has.</p>

<p>Test Cloud not only provides monitoring capabilities, but also relieves us from testing the same application's functionality on different devices manually, thus giving us a true continuous integration process.</p>
<ul>
<li>It provides continuous testing capabilities to our CI process with automated test runs and detailed reports with notifications</li>
<li>Testing an application on different OS versions is critical to the success of a mobile application, and Test Cloud serves that purpose very well</li>
<li>Testing an application on different devices from its huge device list is available on the cloud</li>
<li>Test Cloud analyzes the performance of applications</li>
<li>Test Cloud analyzes memory usage on different devices with different hardware configurations</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's go through some steps to see how to monitor our PhoneCallApp:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://testcloud.xamarin.com/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://testcloud.xamarin.com/</span></a>.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">PhoneCallApp</span> icon to get to the details of the test runs:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7af0ddef-9673-47aa-9ce5-b4f23efde184.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>On the next page, you'll see a list of tests run for the application:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d00e4410-6401-486a-90b9-7088ed53e33b.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now, because we have only run one test so far, Test Cloud does not provide us with the graphical metrics shown in the preceding screenshot. In other examples we'll see next, you'll be able to see a more detailed comparison of different test runs.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Click on the test run from the list to see its results:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dc91bc25-de3b-420a-9d21-10deb16c90c4.png"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>The test run listed is the one we ran earlier in previous chapters and uploaded from our machine to Xamarin Test Cloud using the command line.</li>
<li>To get an idea of this interface, let's have a look at different parts of Xamarin Test Cloud's interface.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="8">
<li>Now, this is an overview screen that shows a summary of all the tests run for this application:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3cb504b0-354c-4246-bc16-8d417ff58e2d.png"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>This screen shows summary details, such as how many tests failed from the total number of tests run, how many times the app ran on a device, how many devices these tests were run on, and much more.</li>
<li>This screen is very useful to get a brief idea when you want to get a report on how your application is doing on different devices and OS versions.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="11">
<li>The next thing you'll see in the left pane is the list of UITests included in the test run:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/12f70ec9-801f-4316-9d10-4ac48ed63369.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="12">
<li>This screen basically has a list of all the Xamarin.UITests that you included in your project. You can click on these different tests to see their respective results on the right side of the screen.</li>
<li>Let's click on the test from the list in the preceding screen.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="14">
<li>This will take us to the next screen, which has detailed reports for the test run:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7ff71190-2f28-4bc3-9cf0-a868ec489fc1.png"/></div>
<ol start="15">
<li>Have a close look at the left pane on this screen.</li>
<li>It gives us some steps of the test run on the device.</li>
<li>These steps are only what we had written previously in the code to take a screenshot of every activity the test does.</li>
<li>The steps are as mentioned (we are using the screens of the test code written in previous chapters here):
<ul>
<li><strong>App started</strong>: Take a screenshot when the app starts; this was written in the <kbd>BeforeEachTest()</kbd> method in the <kbd>Tests.cs</kbd> file:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/40ffa47c-6c21-4365-b517-da845e3154f1.png"/></div>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>Call button pressed</strong>: This step is when the Xamarin.UITest presses the call button to make a call:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3c471fbd-416e-4ebe-acee-b33bbb630929.png" style=""/></div>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>Failed step (the assert)</strong>: This is the last step and is shown to provide proof of the failed step, so you can see the outcome that we received and compare it with what was expected. This was the final assert that decides whether the test passes or not, based on the outcome in the <kbd>Assert.IsTrue()</kbd> condition.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="19">
<li>You can click on each of these steps in the left pane and analyze the screenshots taken to see exactly what went on during the test. This is a great way to see exactly what went wrong when the test failed.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="20">
<li>Now, sometimes the screenshots are not enough to identify the issue. For a more detailed analysis, Test Cloud also provides us with <span class="packt_screen">Device Log</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/0160c05a-790b-47bf-a920-b3ffacf242b2.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="21">
<li>Device logs are a great way to see what's going on under the hood and get more detailed information about the application's behavior and how the device itself behaves when the application is run on it.</li>
<li>This can help pinpoint the issues when a test fails on the device; logs are always a savior in that sort of scenario.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="23">
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Device Log</span> and you can see step-by-step logs for each screenshot on the same screen:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c8c9768c-b5fd-4e70-ab7b-7a8a1df6d81c.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="24">
<li>When a test fails, Test Cloud provides us with one more option, to see the <span class="packt_screen">Test Failures</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bbca5074-34c6-407d-b9ae-5cee3d2cef5a.png"/></div>
<ol start="25">
<li>It's very useful for automated test developers to see the exception information when a test fails.</li>
<li>Last but not least, there is also a <span class="packt_screen">Test Log</span> option, which can be used to get a consolidated log of the entire test run:</li>
</ol>

<p>Now that we have seen different options provided by Test Cloud to monitor our application and its functionality using test runs, let's see how the dashboard and tests look when we have multiple test runs on various physical devices with different OS versions.</p>
<p>This will give us a better idea of how comparative monitoring can be done on Test Cloud to analyze an application's behavior on different devices, and compare them with one another.</p>
<p>The Xamarin Store application is a sample application provided by Test Cloud on its platform to help understand the platform and get an idea of the dashboard. Let's go through the steps to understand how to monitor your application running on multiple devices, and how to compare different test runs:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the Test Cloud home page, just like in the previous example, and click on the <span class="packt_screen">Xamarin Store</span> icon:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c7e51c4c-3afe-45d6-9b8a-cb1b097bff93.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the next screen, you'll see a graphical representation of different test runs and brief information about how many tests failed of the total tests run, what the application size is, and its peak memory usage information during different test runs:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2300f86f-8098-4308-917d-913c0efa42b1.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>This gives us a nice comparative look at how our application is performing on different test runs. It is possible that the application was performing fine during the first run, and then some code changes made some functionality fail. So, this graph is very useful to monitor a timeline of changes that affected application functionality.</li>
<li>You can further click on the graph or the test run to see an overview of it.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now, this screen gives us a great view of how an application running on different devices can be monitored. It's a very nice way to keep track of the application on different devices and OS versions:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/a47bfb69-897c-4c4f-87cf-e5ab5384b745.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Let's click on one of the steps to see the results of the step on multiple devices:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/b2694589-ee52-4d21-8271-cc7a438848de.png"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>The red icon shows failed tests. This page shows all the devices you chose to run the test on; it shows all the devices the test passed on, and shows a red flag on failed devices.</li>
<li>You can further click on each device to get device-specific screens and logs.</li>
</ol>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>An Android app's performance is equally important for a great user experience and a fast-responsive application. <strong>Android Device Monitor</strong> (<strong>ADM</strong>) is a great tool to identify performance issues and build reports upon them, for profiling and to ensure good application performance when it comes to Android apps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Visual Studio, and from the toolbar, run Android Device Monitor:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/529b04a9-ea50-46c7-8872-988ec04a5669.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>A new application, Android Device Manager, should open:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9bfebfd6-5c81-4645-9631-0fe6c5982901.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Go back to Visual Studio and run PhoneCallApp to get the device listed in Android Device Monitor.</li>
<li>You can run the application on an emulator or a physical device connected to the computer.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Once the application has started, come back to Android Device Monitor and you should be able to see the device running in the left pane.</li>
<li>Under the device name, you should be able to see all the processes running on the device.</li>
<li>In that list, select your application and you should be able to see related info:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d1c48096-4716-4dac-8fb3-3bd1f2317637.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>To monitor different threads running in your application, click on the Update Threads button on the left pane's toolbar, and then you should be able to see different threads running by your application on the right-hand side:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dd279fb3-50ca-4d82-b302-22193d618aed.png"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Being able to monitor threads run by your application can be very helpful in finding any unwanted background threads that might be causing extra battery usage or slowing down your application.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="10">
<li>Sometimes, a thread might get deadlocked and it is very difficult to identify issues in such scenarios. This feature of ADM helps in a big way.</li>
<li>Similarly, monitoring the memory usage of your application is a great tool to optimize your app and support low-memory devices, and sometimes improve the performance by reducing memory consumption.</li>
<li>Click on Cause <strong>garbage collection</strong> (<strong>GC</strong>) from the toolbar in the left pane and then select <span class="packt_screen">Heap</span> on the right side to see the heap memory allocation details:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bb3f2998-3930-48c0-a631-35a8ed557e5b.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="13">
<li>You can get more detailed allocation monitoring in the <span class="packt_screen">Allocation Tracker</span> tab. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Start Tracking</span> and then the <span class="packt_screen">Get Allocations</span> button to get allocation details:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/38984534-077b-4c70-b88a-833ab204f6a7.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="14">
<li>There are also options to monitor network-related usage.</li>
<li>A very important feature of Android Device Monitor is profiling, which helps in profiling time taken and other details, based on methods in your application code. It is a great tool to identify method-level performance and latency.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">To use this feature, click on the Start Method Profiling button on the toolbar in the left pane:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6b18866c-bc47-4d38-a927-33e9ed0df9b2.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="16">
<li>For the next step, select whether you want <span class="packt_screen">Sample based profiling</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Trace based profiling</span> and click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign" style="color: black;font-size: 1em"><img src="assets/9f31cd02-a59d-4aa3-8c2f-01076a648e1e.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="17">
<li>Do your tasks on the application, come back to ADM, and click on the Stop Method Profiling button.</li>
<li>A trace file is generated, containing the trace information you want to analyze:
<ul>
<li><strong>A timeline panel</strong>: It describes when each thread and method started and stopped. We can go to a specific timespan and check what each thread did at that moment.</li>
<li><strong>A profile panel</strong>: This provides a summary of what happened inside a method. We can see which one took the most CPU time, or how many calls it made.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign" style="color: black;font-size: 1em"><img src="assets/894fe773-bc48-4e9c-91e4-4eb34a08a49c.png"/></div>
<ol start="19">
