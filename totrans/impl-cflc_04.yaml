    First, let’s get to know the team. The team consists of five people who work from
    different countries in different time zones. It is not easy for them to come together
    physically, and they need a productive, collaborative workspace. Just like a physical
    office, they want to come together to discuss and share information. We will create
    this space virtually and put it at the team’s service. We will learn how to create
    a space and configure it properly, so that you can configure all team spaces within
    your company. In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:'

    are highly experienced in remote working, such as Miro.

    Typically, critical information is shared during this type of meeting, and you
    do not want it to disappear. Thus, the notes of this meeting can be really long
    and intense. That’s why a self-updating table of contents becomes handy to make
    the work more visible and practical for the team to navigate such a document.

    First, we created a team space containing all the information the team will need.
    Then, we provided a brief **Overview** page in this space and learned how to interact
    with our teammates, including important topics such as collaborative capturing,
    editing, and sharing information. Finally, after discussing how to manage meetings
    and decisions with Confluence, we also discovered powerful Confluence features
    such as templates and macros. Now, using all this new information, you can provide
    your teams with a solid workspace where they can collaborate while working remotely.
    In the next chapter, we will learn how to use macros to easily manage dynamic
    content.
