		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Chapter 7</em>: Managing Fields, Screens, and Issue Layouts</h1>
			<p>Our previous chapters explored how to create <strong class="bold">Jira Work Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">JWM</strong>) <em class="italic">projects</em> and <em class="italic">issues</em>, which represent the work we do. We then looked at the new tools in JWM, how issues appear in each tool, and the functionality these tools provide.</p>
			<p>This chapter covers the creation and basic functions of <em class="italic">custom fields</em> and the types of fields that can be created. We will also explore what <em class="italic">screens</em> are automatically created when a new JWM project is created. And then, we'll see how to add custom fields to the screens.</p>
			<p>We will discuss <em class="italic">issue layouts</em>, the different sections of the issue screen, and how to rearrange fields on a screen. This chapter also covers custom field contexts and how to limit the display of fields on screens based on the combination of projects and issue types.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Custom fields</li>
				<li>Using screens to view and edit your work</li>
				<li>How issue layouts affect the fields on your screens</li>
				<li>Screen schemes</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will know how to create a new custom field, how to add the field to a screen in your project, and the basic functions of screens in JWM. You will also be able to modify the issue layouts of fields, for example, by moving fields between separate sections of a screen.</p>
			<p>Finally, you will understand which schemes in the project are related to screens and which scheme type is linked to the project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As JWM is only available in the <strong class="bold">Jira Cloud</strong> environment, the technical requirement for this chapter is simple:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Access to the Jira Cloud environment</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you already have access to Jira Cloud, that's great – you are ready to go! If not, <strong class="bold">Atlassian</strong> provides a free JWM account for up to 10 users. You can create your account by following the instructions at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free">https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free</a>.</p>
			<p>Now, let's get started by looking at custom fields.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Creating and using custom fields</h1>
			<p>One of the most <a id="_idIndexMarker377"/>flexible options you can use when modifying your JWM projects is creating <em class="italic">custom fields</em>. There are several different field types available, but here are some of the most used:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Date picker</strong>: This is<a id="_idIndexMarker378"/> used for dates only. It does not include time, although there is an additional field type that includes both date and time.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Number field</strong>: This creates a simple number field that allows for decimals but not commas.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Radio buttons</strong>: This creates a traditional radio button field where you supply the available options.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User picker (single user)</strong>: This creates a dropdown for selecting a single licensed user in the system.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User picker (multiple users)</strong>: This creates a field that allows for multiple users where you begin the selection by typing the initial letters of the user's name. Once selected, you can type and add additional usernames.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Paragraph</strong>: This creates a paragraph-style field for entering text. It supports rich text rendering.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Short text</strong>: This creates a regular text field for plain text only.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Select list (single choice)</strong>: This creates a drop-down list of values that you supply.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Select list (multiple choices)</strong>: This works like the multiple users user picker list, except you can provide the possible list of values. You can select multiple items in the list, but<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> only one at a time.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Select list (cascading)</strong>: This creates another type of select list where you provide the list values. However, a second field is available with values that depend on the<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> values entered in the first field.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, let's see where we can access the custom fields.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.1_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1 – The Settings menu&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1 – The Settings menu</p>
			<p>To create a new custom field or to modify an existing one, you will need to be a JWM administrator. To access the custom fields function, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select the gear icon to open the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu on the far-right side of the top navigation bar.</li>
				<li>Then, choose the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Finally, click <strong class="bold">Custom fields</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After arriving on the next screen, click <strong class="bold">Custom fields</strong> on the left-hand side menu, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.2_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2 – The Custom fields option&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2 – The Custom fields option</p>
			<p>Clicking <strong class="bold">Custom fields</strong> will <a id="_idIndexMarker381"/>open a screen displaying a list of all the current custom fields in your instance. You can use the search box to find a specific custom field or to verify if a field by that name already exists.</p>
			<p>To create a new custom field, click on the <strong class="bold">Create custom field</strong> button on the top-right of the screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.3_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3 – Creating a custom field&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3 – Creating a custom field</p>
			<p>At this point, you will see a list of the available field types. Notice that on the left-hand side, the default is for the standard list of field types. You can also click on <strong class="bold">All</strong> or <strong class="bold">Advanced</strong> to see additional field types.</p>
			<p>For our example, we are going to choose the date picker field type by clicking <strong class="bold">Date Picker</strong>. Once <a id="_idIndexMarker382"/>selected, click the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button to continue to the next step:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.4_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4 – Custom field types&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4 – Custom field types</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Once you create a custom field, you cannot change or convert its type. If you incorrectly choose the wrong field type when you create the field, or if you change your mind as to the preferred type, you will need to create a new field.</p>
			<p>Although it might seem out of sequence, you choose the field type before entering the name of the field. <em class="italic">Figure 7.5</em> displays the <strong class="bold">Name</strong> and <strong class="bold">Description</strong> fields that allow you to add these values for the custom field:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.5_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.5 – Naming a custom field&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.5 – Naming a custom field</p>
			<p>For our example, we have chosen to name the field <code>Presentation Date</code>. After you have selected your field type and added a name for your custom field, click the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button (as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7.5</em>). Your new custom field is now created!</p>
			<p>However, the<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> new field will not be visible on any screens yet. So, the next display after your field is created will allow you to immediately add the field to an existing screen(s).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Adding fields to screens</h2>
			<p>To add your<a id="_idIndexMarker384"/> field <a id="_idIndexMarker385"/>to ALL screens in your instance, you can click on the box to the right of the <strong class="bold">Tab</strong> heading, as highlighted by the arrow on the right-hand side in <em class="italic">Figure 7.6</em>. This is a handy way to add the field to multiple screens without having to click every box. You may eventually have dozens or even hundreds of screens, so this is a quick method to use:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.6_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.6 – Adding a custom field to a screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.6 – Adding a custom field to a screen</p>
			<p>Of course, you might want to add the field to only a single screen or a handful of screens. To do that, enter some text in the search box for the screen(s) you would like to narrow the <code>Staff</code>. As you type the letters, the list will immediately filter down to screens matching your search.</p>
			<p>Then, select<a id="_idIndexMarker386"/> the checkbox for each desired screen and click <a id="_idIndexMarker387"/>the <code>Staff</code> for our project and linking the custom field to the STAFF project screens.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You may be tempted to create a new custom field for every need you have for every screen in every project. However, an excessive number of custom fields will slow your system down. Because of this, creating new custom fields should be done sparingly.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at how we can limit the impact of custom fields on our system and how they can clarify the intended values to be entered.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Editing the context for a custom field</h2>
			<p>Of course, once a <a id="_idIndexMarker388"/>custom field has been created and linked to a screen, you might need to edit information about the field. However, one of the first things you will want to do is to edit the <em class="italic">context</em> associated with the field.</p>
			<p>To edit the context of the field, we return to the list of custom fields (as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.2</em>). Enter some text in the search box to find your new field. Again, we will use the <code>Presentation Date</code> field for our example.</p>
			<p>When you have displayed the desired field, click the ellipsis menu (<strong class="bold">…</strong>) on the right-hand side of the field row and select <strong class="bold">Contexts and default value</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.7_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.7 – Configuring a custom field&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.7 – Configuring a custom field</p>
			<p>The resulting screen will display various sections, including a list of <em class="italic">issue</em> types and <em class="italic">projects</em>.</p>
			<p>The <em class="italic">context</em> will link the field to the project(s) and/or issue type(s). Connecting the field to at least one project or at least one issue type will help tremendously with any system resource issues related to custom fields. Fields that are global for both projects and issue types are taxing to the system and may result in errors and slow performance:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.8_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.8 – Updating the field context&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.8 – Updating the field context</p>
			<p>To select an issue type or project, simply search for its name in the appropriate section and click it. If you want to select multiple values in that section, be sure to hold down the <em class="italic">Ctrl</em> (PC) or <em class="italic">Command</em> (Mac) key <a id="_idIndexMarker389"/>when clicking on the second and subsequent values.</p>
			<p>Finally, click the <strong class="bold">Modify</strong> button to save the changes to the context. If you want to switch back to not having a value selected, you can click the <strong class="bold">Any issue type</strong> value under <strong class="bold">Issue types</strong> or the <strong class="bold">Global context</strong> radio button in the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> section.</p>
			<p>To change the name of the custom field, return to the list of fields and select <strong class="bold">Edit details</strong> from the ellipsis (<strong class="bold">…</strong>) menu. Then, simply change the name. Be aware that changing the name of the field might cause automation rules or workflow post functions to fail:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.9_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.9 – Changing the name of a custom field&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.9 – Changing the name of a custom field</p>
			<p>Next, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>learn how to arrange our new custom fields on project screens.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Using screens to view and edit your work</h1>
			<p>During the <a id="_idIndexMarker391"/>custom<a id="_idIndexMarker392"/> field creation process, you can choose screens (or none) to contain your field. However, when you select a screen(s) for your field, the field is simply placed at the bottom of the list of fields for that screen. Perhaps you would like to move the field to a different position on the screen. Or maybe you chose not to link the field to any screen during the creation process.</p>
			<p>Either way, let's explore how we can make these modifications once the custom field has been created. To access the screens, go to <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> | <strong class="bold">Screens</strong>. This leads to the screen shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.10</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.10_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.10 – Identifying screens&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.10 – Identifying screens</p>
			<p>Simply type some text in the search box for the screen you are looking for and any screens matching the text will automatically appear. It is important to recognize that there might be different screens available for our project.</p>
			<p>For most JWM projects, two default screens will be created for the project: the <strong class="bold">Create Issue Screen</strong> and the <strong class="bold">Edit/View Issue Screen</strong>. An additional <strong class="bold">Resolve Issue Screen</strong> might be created for selected projects. The reason for the difference in the two default screens is that you may want fewer fields or different fields available when creating a new issue versus when editing an existing issue. Having fewer fields usually provides clarity and simpler input values for the person creating the issue.</p>
			<p>To edit which fields are shown on the screen or to rearrange their order, just click on the screen name. At this point, the <strong class="bold">Configure Screen</strong> window will appear:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.11_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.11 – Adding a field to a screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.11 – Adding a field to a screen</p>
			<p>To add a<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> field, simply<a id="_idIndexMarker394"/> start typing the name of the field and values will begin to be shown. For our example, we are adding the <code>Presentation Date</code> field that we previously created. When the value appears, click on the field name. To rearrange the order in which the fields appear, click on the left-hand side handle and drag the field up or down.</p>
			<p>Next, we will take a look at the sections of a screen and how to move fields to different areas on screens. <em class="italic">Figure 7.12</em> displays the various sections of a screen, and this is followed by a short description of each:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.12_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.12 – Editing fields on a screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.12 – Editing fields on a screen</p>
			<p>Let's take a<a id="_idIndexMarker395"/> look at <a id="_idIndexMarker396"/>each section of the screen:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Context section</strong>: By default, this contains all non-paragraph/multi-line text fields. This includes the following field types: number, date, user picker, select list, and single-line text.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description section</strong>: By default, this contains only paragraph or multi-line text fields and the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> field.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hidden fields</strong>: This contains fields that are hidden if they contain no value. Clicking the <strong class="bold">More fields</strong> link will display or hide the fields.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Attachments</strong>: The <strong class="bold">Attach</strong> button must appear on the screen if you want to be able to add attachments to the issue. This section also contains the <strong class="bold">Create subtask</strong> and <strong class="bold">Link issue</strong> buttons.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Comments and history</strong>: The <strong class="bold">Activity</strong> section contains a wealth of information. Clicking the <strong class="bold">Comments</strong> tab shows all comments that have been added to the issue. The <strong class="bold">History</strong> tab will show all changes that have taken place with the issue since it was created. The <strong class="bold">Work log</strong> tab shows any time that has been recorded/charged to the issue.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Though the attachments and activity sections are not actually sections for adding or moving fields, they show information related to the fields for the issue.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">The order of fields on a screen will apply to all projects that use the screen. However, you can use the <strong class="bold">Issue layout</strong> tool for your project to rearrange the fields for just that project, without affecting other projects.</p>
			<p>Now that we<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> know how to create custom fields and add them to a <a id="_idIndexMarker398"/>screen, next, we will see how we can move the fields between sections on the screen for the related project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>How issue layouts affect the fields on your screens</h1>
			<p>To modify the <a id="_idIndexMarker399"/>layout of the fields used by the screen for your project only, click on the <strong class="bold">Issue layout</strong> link on the left-hand side menu when in the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> screen. You must be a project administrator to access the project settings and modify the issue layout:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.13_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.13 – The Issue layout link in the Project settings window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.13 – The Issue layout link in the Project settings window</p>
			<p>After selecting this option, you will advance to the <strong class="bold">Issue layout</strong> screen, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure</em> <em class="italic">7.14</em>. If you<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> have multiple screens for different issue types in your project, you will be able to edit the layout of each screen. See <em class="italic">Figure 7.16</em>, which is toward the end of this chapter, for more details on issue type screen schemes:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.14_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.14 – Editing the issue layout&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.14 – Editing the issue layout</p>
			<p>To modify the location of the fields on your screen, simply click on the <strong class="bold">Edit layout</strong> link on the right-hand side of the <strong class="bold">Issue layout</strong> screen (<em class="italic">Figure 7.14</em>).</p>
			<p>On the <strong class="bold">Issue layout</strong> screen, you can drag fields from section to section. <em class="italic">Figure 7.15</em> highlights these sections, which we will list in detail next:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.15_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.15 – The sections of the Issue layout screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.15 – The sections of the Issue layout screen</p>
			<p>Let's look at <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>each of these in detail:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Description fields</strong>: This relates to the <strong class="bold">Description</strong> section, previously seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7.12</em>. Although this originally contained multi-line text fields, you can drag other types of fields into this section, except for the <strong class="bold">Status</strong> field.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Context fields</strong>: This relates to the <strong class="bold">Context</strong> section, previously seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7.12</em>. You can drag other types of fields into this section, including the <strong class="bold">Description fields</strong>. However, you may not move the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> field into this section.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">HIDE WHEN EMPTY</strong>: This relates to the <strong class="bold">Hidden Fields</strong> section, previously seen in <em class="italic">Figure 7.12</em>. Fields in this section will not show on the screen if the field has no value.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Hidden fields</strong>: Fields in this section will not show on the screen at all for this project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Screen name</strong>: Click on this link if you want to edit the base screen used by the issue layout.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Save changes</strong>: When all of your changes are complete, be sure to click the <strong class="bold">Save changes</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In our final section, we will see how screens can be grouped into <em class="italic">schemes</em> for attachment<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> to a project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Screen schemes</h1>
			<p>We began the<a id="_idIndexMarker403"/> process of adding screens to our project by simply creating the screen. However, the screen cannot be directly attached to the project to begin using it. First, it must be added to a screen scheme. As we saw in <a href="B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes</em>, a <em class="italic">scheme</em> can be thought of as a bucket holding various items. Therefore, a <em class="italic">screen scheme</em> would be a scheme consisting of multiple screens.</p>
			<p>So, our <strong class="bold">STAFF: Project Management</strong> screen scheme contains the <strong class="bold">Create Issue Screen</strong> and the <strong class="bold">Edit/View Issue Screen</strong>, as we saw in <em class="italic">Figure 7.10</em>.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 7.16</em> shows the related screen components accessed from the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Issues path</strong>. Because multiple issue types can be connected to a project and because each issue type can have a separate screen scheme associated with it, these are all connected in a second scheme called the <em class="italic">issue type screen scheme</em>.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.16_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.16 – The Issue types window&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.16 – The Issue types window</p>
			<p>This scheme is then attached to the project, as opposed to the individual screens themselves. <em class="italic">Figure 7.17</em> shows the relationship between the screens and related schemes:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.17_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 7.17 – The screen scheme hierarchy&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.17 – The screen scheme hierarchy</p>
			<p>When you create the JWM project, these screens and screen schemes are automatically created and <a id="_idIndexMarker404"/>related to each other. Let's talk about this structure briefly. If you were to build these connections from the ground up, you would follow this process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Create your base screen and populate the screen with your desired fields.</li>
				<li>Create a screen scheme – this scheme will be based on the screen you created in <em class="italic">Step 1</em>.</li>
				<li>Create an issue type screen scheme – this scheme will be based on the screen scheme you created in <em class="italic">Step 2</em>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Another description of the relationship between screens and issue types can be seen in the Atlassian documentation at<a href="https://bit.ly/3BBuzCq"> https://bit.ly/3BBuzCq</a>. Though the notation is for Atlassian <strong class="bold">Data Center</strong> and <strong class="bold">Server</strong>, the graphics and descriptions are still relevant for <strong class="bold">Jira</strong> <strong class="bold">Cloud</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>New terms learned in this chapter</h1>
			<p>Let's conclude the chapter by going through a list of new terms we learned:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Custom fields</strong>: These are<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> fields of various types such as text, number, pick lists, and user lists, which are created and assigned to a <em class="italic">context</em>. The fields can appear on multiple screens.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Context</strong>: These link<a id="_idIndexMarker406"/> fields to projects and/or issue types.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned how to create new custom fields, attach them to an existing screen, and configure the layout of the screen to place the fields in the appropriate sections. All of this allows for a smoother user experience, as fields can appear in a context that makes more sense. We have also seen how to configure our custom fields so that they are not a drain on system resources by linking each to a project and/or issue type.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to assign permissions to users and how to carry out simple system and project administration.</p>
