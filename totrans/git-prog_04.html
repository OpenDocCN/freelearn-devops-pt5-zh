    <p class="normal">In this chapter, you will see how to merge branches, using different types of merges. You will also see how to handle merge conflicts and tools to make managing conflicts easier. You will learn about pull requests and the difference between a fast-forward merge and a "true" merge.</p>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, you will learn:</p>

      <li class="bullet">How to push a commit to the server</li>
      <li class="bullet">How to manage your commits with the command line, Visual Studio, and GitHub Desktop</li>

    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let's start with an overview of merging.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-82" class="title">Merging overview</h1>
    <p class="normal">If you are on a feature branch, and the feature is sufficiently complete and tested, you will want to merge <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>your branch back into the main branch. Some <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>organizations let you simply merge, others (most?) require that you create a <strong class="screenText">Pull Request (PR)</strong>. A <strong class="keyword">PR</strong> says, essentially, "Please examine my code and if you think it is right, merge it into the main branch."</p>
    <p class="normal">Having a second (or third) set of eyes on your code before merging can save a lot of headaches later on (see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Fixing Mistakes (Undo)</em>, on fixing mistakes).</p>
    <p class="normal">Often, if you've <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>been careful (see below) you will merge without a problem. From time to time, however, you will run into the dreaded merge conflict. You'll see below a couple ways to handle that conflict.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-83" class="title">Book</h2>
    <p class="normal">You will remember from the previous chapter that we have a directory, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">C:\GitHub\VisualStudio\ProGitForProgrammers</code>, that is the home of the Books application and that we've been editing in Visual Studio. Of course, we don't have to manage it in Visual Studio; we can use any of our tools. For example, I can open the terminal and change directories to the Books app:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.1: Opening the terminal</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice that it says I have one commit to push (as indicated by the up-pointing arrow followed by the 1). I must have forgotten to do so the last time I was working with this code. I don't want to just push it, howeverâ€”who knows what's in there? There are a few ways to find out.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-84" class="title">What's in that push?</h1>
    <p class="normal">From the <a id="_idIndexMarker129"/>command line, we can use the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">git show</code> command:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.2: Examining the push</p>
    <p class="normal">There's a lot of information here. First, we see the author and the date. Then we see the message that <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>was attached to this commit (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Add properties</code>). Next, Git does a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">diff</code> (difference) between <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book.cs</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book.cs</code> naming the first one <strong class="screenText">a</strong> and the second <strong class="screenText">b</strong>. The one labeled <strong class="screenText">a</strong> is <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book.cs</code> before this commit, the one labeled <strong class="screenText">b</strong> is the new contents in this commit.</p>
    <p class="normal">You may have noticed the line that says <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">/dev/null</code>. This indicates that a file is being compared against nothing, and thus everything is new.</p>
    <p class="normal">The next line shows that <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">/dev/null</code> is being compared against file <strong class="screenText">b</strong> (the new <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book.cs</code> file):</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.3: Comparing against dev/null</p>
    <p class="normal">What follows are the changes. Deletions will be marked in red, modifications in green, and new code in yellow. (This display and these colors may depend on which shell you are using.) We see here that three <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">using</code> statements, a namespace, and the class <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book</code> were all added in this commit. Before we push it, let's see what we can learn in Visual Studio.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-85" class="title">Visual Studio</h2>
    <p class="normal">Opening the <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>same directory in Visual Studio and going to the Git view reveals, as we would expect, that we have one commit to push (outgoing):</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.4: Visual Studio showing one file to push</p>
    <p class="normal">Before we push, let's see what's in that push. Clicking on <strong class="screenText">1 outgoing</strong> opens two windows. The <strong class="screenText">Branches</strong> window shows us which branch we are on (<strong class="screenText">Book</strong>):</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.5: Visual Studio showing contents of the local repository</p>
    <p class="normal">The middle panel has the really cool info. It tells you the local (as opposed to origin) history of your branches:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.6: Visual Studio showing commit history</p>
    <p class="normal">We can see that <strong class="screenText">main</strong> has five commits (reading newest to oldest) and that preceding the newest commit in <strong class="screenText">main</strong>, we have an outgoing commit on the <strong class="screenText">Book</strong> branch, whose message is <strong class="screenText">Add properties</strong>. This is consistent with what we saw at the command line.</p>
    <p class="normal">We can go <a id="_idIndexMarker132"/>further, and return to <strong class="screenText">Solution Explorer</strong>. Because there is more to see in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code> (rather than <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book.cs</code>), right-click on <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code> and choose <strong class="screenText">Git</strong> and then <strong class="screenText">History</strong>. That opens the <strong class="screenText">History</strong> page for <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_07.png" alt=""/></figure>

    <div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Note that if we registered a user with an image, that image would be shown on the extreme left.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">Here we see the four commits. We can compare them by right-clicking on, for example, the first one and choosing <strong class="screenText">Compare with previous</strong>. Two windows open. On the left, you have the older commit, on the right the newer. We can see that in the newer commit one line was added, which is shown in Visual Studio with green highlighting:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.8: Side-by-side comparison</p>
    <p class="normal">You can <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>see that Visual Studio can give you a graphic representation of the same information you might get from the command line.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-86" class="title">Details, details</h2>
    <p class="normal">Let's close <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>all these history windows and go back to the list of outgoing and local history. Under <strong class="screenText">Outgoing</strong>, we see <strong class="screenText">Add properties</strong>. Right-click on that line and a window will open on the right. You'll see the commit ID (ID) along with the name of the committer, the date, and so forth. You'll also see the message and then you'll see a list of which files were changed (in this case, <strong class="screenText">Book.cs</strong>):</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.9: Visual Studio showing which files have changed for a commit</p>
    <p class="normal">We want to <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>know what changed in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book.cs</code>. To do this, right-click on <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book.cs</code> and choose <strong class="screenText">View History</strong>. The single commit will come up in the middle window. Double-click on that and you'll see the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book</code> class that is being added by this commit.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-87" class="title">GitHub Desktop</h1>
    <p class="normal">We can open <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>GitHub Desktop to the same directory. Click on <strong class="screenText">File</strong> and choose <strong class="screenText">Add local repository...</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_10.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.10: Opening GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">The next step is to tell GitHub Desktop where that repository is. A dialog opens and you can either enter the local path by hand, or you can click <strong class="screenText">Choose...</strong>, which will bring you to a Windows Explorer window where you can pick the appropriate directory. Once that is all set, click <strong class="screenText">Add repository</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_11.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.11: Adding a local repository</p>
    <p class="normal">You'll now be brought to the main page. Notice that we are still in the repository <strong class="screenText">ProGitForProgrammers</strong>, but on the <strong class="screenText">Book</strong> branch, and that it knows we have one commit to push. It also offers a handy <strong class="screenText">Push origin</strong> button with an explanation that pressing <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>that button will push the commit to the origin (the server; your repository on GitHub):</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_12.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.12: GitHub Desktop information bar</p>
    <p class="normal">Once again, we want to know what we are pushing. No problem, just click <strong class="screenText">History</strong> and you'll see the history of commits and the changes for whichever commit you highlight:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_13.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.13: History in GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>we've seen the various ways the command line, Visual Studio, and GitHub Desktop manage the commit, it is time to get the commit to the server.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-88" class="title">Push it already</h2>
    <p class="normal">Let's return <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>to the command line and push the commit we've been examining:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_14.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.14: Pushing from the command line</p>
    <p class="normal">If you go to Visual Studio now, it should say <strong class="screenText">0 outgoing</strong> as you've pushed the one that was waiting. Similarly, GitHub Desktop will have changed its button from <strong class="screenText">Push Origin</strong> to <strong class="screenText">Create Pull Request</strong> â€“ the likely next thing to do. </p>
    <p class="normal">Now that we have the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book</code> branch sorted, it is (finally!) time to merge it into <strong class="screenText">main</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-89" class="title">Visual Studio</h2>
    <p class="normal">Our goal is to merge <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book</code> back into <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code>. To do this in Visual Studio, just click on <strong class="screenText">Git</strong> and then <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>on <strong class="screenText">Manage Branches</strong>. Your <strong class="screenText">Branches</strong> window will open. Right-click on <strong class="screenText">main</strong> and choose <strong class="screenText">Checkout</strong>. You are now ready to merge <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Book</code> into <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code>, which you'll see in the right-click (context) menu as well:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_15.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.15: Merging in Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">The trick is, while main is checked out, right-click on <strong class="screenText">Book</strong> and you'll see the option to make the merge.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-90" class="title">Merge conflicts</h1>
    <p class="normal">Let's turn to <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>the command line and do a pull as our branch has diverged from the origin. When we do, we're told that there is a merge conflict in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code> and that the merge has failed. Git tells you to fix the conflicts and then commit the result. This is unusual, to get a merge conflict on a pull, but as you can see, it does happen. Let's handle this conflict and then set up a more typical situation:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_16.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.16: A merge conflict</p>
    <p class="normal">There are a <a id="_idIndexMarker142"/>few ways to handle any merge, but the easiest is to use a merge tool. I use KDiff3 (<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/kdiff3/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/kdiff3/</a>). Since I use this a lot, I have put it into my config file:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git config --edit --global 
</code></pre>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_17.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.17: Reviewing the configuration file</p>
    <p class="normal">This sets up KDiff3 as my merge tool and tells Git where to find it. One of the things I like most about KDiff is that it will often fix the problem for you.</p>
    <p class="normal">To invoke it, all I need to write is:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git mergetool
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">and it opens KDiff to the conflict.</p>
    <p class="normal">Here it found two problems and was able to fix one:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_18.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.18: KDiff automatically solves one conflict</p>
    <p class="normal">It then brings <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>us to a window with multiple panes. The panes on top show you the conflict:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_19.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.19: Conflicts as shown in KDiff</p>
    <p class="normal">You can see on the left side (<strong class="screenText">Local</strong>) that we have one line whereas on the right side (<strong class="screenText">Remote</strong>) we have two lines. Clearly, someone else has edited this file that we edited and now Git doesn't know what to do.</p>
    <p class="normal">In the bottom pane is code to provide context and then a highlighted line where your choice of which line(s) to place there is shown:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_20.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.20: KDiff provides context for your merge</p>
    <p class="normal">When you right-click on that line, you are given a choice to pick the left window (window A), the right window (window B), or both (and you can choose the order they are added in):</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_21.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.21: KDiff asking which version should be placed</p>
    <p class="normal">Once you <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>are done, save the file and close KDiff. &lt;poof\&gt; No more conflict. Git now shows you the changes you made that should now be committed:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_22.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.22: Console indicating that the conflicts have been resolved</p>
    <p class="normal">You can now add that file and commit it, and then push it up to the origin:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_23.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.23: Committing and pushing to origin</p>
    <p class="normal">We've seen <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>how KDiff and similar programs can greatly reduce the amount of work involved in solving merge conflicts.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-91" class="title">Merging from the command line</h2>
    <p class="normal">Much more common is for there to be a merge conflict when you specifically merge locally. To do <a id="_idIndexMarker146"/>so is pretty easy. From the command line, check out the branch you want to merge <strong class="screenText">into</strong> (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code>) and then use the Git command <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">merge</code>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_24.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.24: The merge command</p>
    <p class="normal">Here Git used the "recursive" strategy; a way to speed up the merge.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-92" class="title">Fast forward</h2>
    <p class="normal">Often, however, you'll <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>see Git report that it used a fast forward merge. Fast forward works like this; suppose your starting point is this:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_25.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.25: Fast forward</p>
    <p class="normal">You now want to merge <strong class="keyword">Feature1</strong> into <strong class="keyword">Main</strong>. Notice that <strong class="keyword">Feature1</strong> branched from the tip of <strong class="keyword">Main </strong>(the latest commit). In that case, there is a path from the first commit in <strong class="keyword">Main </strong>to the <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>last commit in <strong class="keyword">Feature1</strong>. In that case, all Git has to do is move <strong class="keyword">Main</strong>'s pointer to the tip of <strong class="keyword">Feature1</strong>, creating a single branch (which it will call <strong class="keyword">Main</strong>):</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_26.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.26: Moving the pointer</p>
    <p class="normal">Because all that <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>is required is moving a pointer to the last commit, this is called <strong class="keyword">fast forward</strong>.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-93" class="title">True merge</h2>
    <p class="normal">In the previous example, <strong class="keyword">Feature1</strong> was branched off of <strong class="keyword">Main</strong> at the point that is still the tip of <strong class="keyword">Main</strong>. But what <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>if someone else merged a branch into <strong class="keyword">Main</strong>, and now the commit you branched off of is no longer the tip:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_27.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.27: Feature 1 does not branch off the tip of Main</p>
    <p class="normal">In this case, you either need a rebase (covered in the next chapter) or a "true" merge:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_04_28.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 4.28: A true merge is required</p>
    <p class="normal">Because there was no path from <strong class="keyword">Main</strong> to the tip of <strong class="keyword">Feature1</strong> that didn't leave out any other commits (for example, the tip of <strong class="keyword">Main</strong>), we use a new commit to bring the two branches together.</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice that <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>this approach adds a new commit (<strong class="keyword">A</strong>) that exists only for the merge. Over time you will have a lot of these relatively meaningless commits cluttering up your history. The solution to this is to rebase, as shown in the next chapter.</p>
    <p class="normal">You don't change anything when doing a fast forward or a true merge; you merge and Git takes care of the details</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-94" class="title">Avoiding conflicts</h1>
    <p class="normal">Avoiding conflict is generally a good thing to do, and in the case of Git, it is a very good thing indeed. Rather than having to resolve a whole lot of conflicts all at once, you really want to catch <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>those conflicts as you go (and thus handle just one or two at a time). If you are on a team, some conflicts cannot be avoided, but there are two good rules of thumb to cut down drastically on the work involved in handling conflicts:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Do not have more than one programmer working on any given file (if possible)</li>
      <li class="bullet">Merge main into your feature branch very frequently</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Notice #2 does <em class="italic">not</em> say to merge your feature branch into main, but rather the other way around. This will <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>not endanger the main thread, but will quickly reveal if there are any conflicts so far. If so, you can fix them in your branch and move on.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-95" class="title">Summary</h1>

    <h1 id="_idParaDest-96" class="title">Challenge</h1>
    <p class="normal">Pretend you are two programmers working on the same project â€“ a utility that contains a calculator and a Fahrenheit to Celsius converter. If you actually have two programmers to do this, even better.</p>
    <p class="normal">Set up a new repository and clone it to two different folders. Have one person populate the main branch with the beginnings of the UtilityKnife project, commit the changes, and push it. Have the other person pull the main branch's changes.</p>
    <p class="normal">OK, you both have a main branch with some code on it. Now have each programmer create their own branch, one to work on the calculator and the other to work on the converter. Along the way, the converter will want to use some of the methods of the calculator. Try to avoid or minimize conflicts, merge frequently, and resolve conflicts that arise.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-97" class="title">Answer</h1>
    <p class="normal">As always, there is no one single correct way to do this. Here is how I worked through it.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-98" class="title">Task #1: Set up a new repository and clone it to two different folders</h2>
    <p class="normal">Notice that we are going to use just one repository. We are building a single program, but at least at first John<strong class="screenText"> </strong>is going to create the calculator while Sara is going to create the temperature converter.

    <p class="normal">We then clone the repo into folders (or separate computers if there are two or more of you). I'll create a directory, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">John</code>, and clone this repo into that directory.</p>

    <p class="normal">We can test that this worked by feeding the method 212 and hoping to get back 100. Let's turn to the program for that:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
using UtilityKnife.Converters;
namespace UtilityKnife
{
    public static class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var converter = new FahrenheitToCelsius();
            var celsius = converter.FahrenheitToCelsiusConverter(212.0);
            Console.WriteLine($"Fahrenheit temp of 212 is {celsius}.");
