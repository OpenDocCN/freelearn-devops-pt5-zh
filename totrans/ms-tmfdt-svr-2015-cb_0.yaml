    ones being Visual Studio IDE, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio Team Services,
    and Visual Studio Team Foundation Server (TFS). Back in November 2004, Microsoft
    released its first version of integrated Application Lifecycle Management (ALM)
    tool, called "Microsoft Visual Studio Team Systems". Over the last 15 years, the
    product has gone through several evolutions, each enriching the developer experience
    and the scope of tooling:'

- en: The Visual Studio family of tools and services now enables heterogeneous software
    development across various platforms. The experience of using open source tooling
    within the product has improved tremendously. Open source solutions are being
    given first class citizen status, and more of these solutions are being pre-packaged
    into the product. This gives us a clear indication that Microsoft wants to become
    the platform of choice for every developer, independent of the technology or platform.
    There is a huge overlap between the tools and services within the Visual Studio
    family of tools. This book focuses entirely on Visual Studio Team Foundation Server
    2015.

- en: Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2015 is at the center of Microsoft's
    ALM solution, providing core services such as version control, Work Item tracking,
    reporting, and automated builds. TFS helps organizations communicate and collaborate
    more effectively throughout the process of designing, building, testing, and deploying
    software, ultimately leading to increased productivity and team output, improved
    quality, and greater visibility of an application's life cycle.

- en: Software delivery itself has gone through a revolution in the last decade. The
    introduction of Agile practices and lean frameworks, such as Scrum, Kanban, XP,
    and RUP, among others, have demonstrated that iterative feedback-driven development
    helps to cope with changes in the marketplace, business, and user requirements.
    Lean processes also help minimize waste and maximize value delivery to end users.
    Better DevOps practices encouraging continuous integration, continuous deployment,
    continuous delivery, and continuous feedback along with better tooling are enabling
    organizations to break the silos between teams. Mission-critical applications
    may still choose to deliver using Waterfall, while a line of business applications
    may find more success choosing lean methodologies. There is no right or wrong
    in this; choose the process and tools that are most appropriate to your delivery
    scenario. Visual Studio TFS supports most processes out of the box, and gives
    you the flexibility to customize and define processes that work best for your
    organization.

- en: Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2015, henceforth referred to as TFS in
    this book, is Microsoft's on-premise offering of ALM Tooling. Microsoft also offers
    a cloud-hosted service called Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). Do not confuse
    VSTS for being Visual Studio IDE in the cloud; it is instead a collection of developer
    services comparable to TFS that run on Microsoft Azure and extend the development
    experience in the cloud. Microsoft is really committed to its hosted service,
    and has moved it into a 3-week cadence. All features are released in VSTS first,
    and then, most features are rolled into TFS via quarterly updates. A timeline
    of features released and those planned in the future releases can be found at
    [https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/release-archive-vso.aspx](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/news/release-archive-vso.aspx).
    The product teams solicit new feature requests via user voice. If you have a burning
    idea for a feature, be sure to log your request at [https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-2015](https://visualstudio.uservoice.com/forums/121579-visual-studio-2015).
    VSTS now offers a lot of enterprise features such as guaranteed uptime, single
    sign on using ADFS and AAD, and compliance to US, European, and Australian data
    sovereignty laws by offering tenants hosted in those regions. Though VSTS boasts
    of having over 3 million active users, organizations that need more control of
    the environment and their data will still prefer TFS over VSTS.

    free, it''s simple to set up, and it can be installed on both client and server
    operating systems. Express does not support integration with SharePoint or Reporting
    Services. If you are setting up TFS for your organization, use the standard version
