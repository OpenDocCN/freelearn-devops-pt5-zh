<h2 id="leanpub-auto-dedication" class="calibre15">Dedication</h2>

<p class="calibre3">I noticed that authors sometimes thank famous people for the help they never received. At other times, they publish introduction written by well-established authors who probably didn’t even read their book. There must be a reason behind that. Maybe it helps to have well-known names. Perhaps listing famous people invokes some unknown powers. There might be a kind of a Vudu magic that binds a reader to the book. Even though I doubt that thanking people helps, I’ll do it anyways. It’s better not to risk it.</p>

<p class="calibre3">I wish to thank the following people: Larry David for being weirder than me; Uncle Bob whose books are always in front of mines in Amazon; Donald Trump for writing entertaining tweets; Josip Broz Tito for not living over 100 years; Netflix for entertaining my daughter while I work; David Heinemeier Hansson for explaining that Ruby On Rails is untestable; Douglas Adams for letting me use his quote at the end of this book. There are many others I could thank, but my humility compels me to stop and list a few others who are not (yet) famous.</p>

<p class="calibre3">This book is dedicated to my daughter Sara that gives me the strength to wake up every morning and do an insane number of working hours. Her smile after coming back from school is all the encouragement I need. To my wife Eva, without whose never-failing support this book would never have been finished.</p>

<p class="calibre3">I love you girls, more than anything in the world. This book is dedicated to you.</p>

<p class="calibre3">To caffeine and sugar, essential ingredients for long nights of writing. To pizza delivery boy without whom I’d starve to death.</p>
