- en: This chapter will switch the focus from technology to people and processes.
    The DevOps initiative was initially about breaking down silos between development
    and operations teams and changing companys' operational models. It will highlight
    methods to unblock IT staff and allow them to work in a more productive fashion,
    but these mindsets have since been extended to quality assurance testing, security,
    and now network operations. This chapter will primarily focus on the evolving
    role of the network engineer, which is changing like the operations engineer before
    them, and the need for network engineers to learn new skills that will allow network
    engineers to remain as valuable as they are today as the industry moves towards
    a completely programmatically controlled operational model.

    increases the number of deployments a team can do in any given day and improves

- en: A byproduct of automation is that the mean time to resolve will also become
    quicker for infrastructure issues. If infrastructure or network changes are automated,

- en: Implementing DevOps also means measuring and monitoring efficiently too, so
    having effective monitoring is crucial on all parts of infrastructure and networking,

    the monitoring system, so the monitoring system as opposed to the talented engineer
    becomes the go-to point of reference when an issue first occurs, or ideally the
    monitoring system becomes the source of truth that alerts on events to prevent
