    The DevOps initiative was initially about breaking down silos between development
    and operations teams and changing companys' operational models. It will highlight
    methods to unblock IT staff and allow them to work in a more productive fashion,
    but these mindsets have since been extended to quality assurance testing, security,
    and now network operations. This chapter will primarily focus on the evolving
    role of the network engineer, which is changing like the operations engineer before
    them, and the need for network engineers to learn new skills that will allow network
    engineers to remain as valuable as they are today as the industry moves towards
    a completely programmatically controlled operational model.

    to improve their internal processes by automating everything they do.

    and automation. Implementing automation naturally improves the velocity of change,
    increases the number of deployments a team can do in any given day and improves
    time to market. Automation of the deployment process allows teams to push fixes
    through to production quickly as well as allowing an organization to push new
    products and features to market.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A byproduct of automation is that the mean time to resolve will also become
    quicker for infrastructure issues. If infrastructure or network changes are automated,
    they can be applied much more efficiently than if they were carried out manually.
    Manual changes depend on the velocity of the engineer implementing the change
    rather than an automated script that can be measured more accurately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Implementing DevOps also means measuring and monitoring efficiently too, so
    having effective monitoring is crucial on all parts of infrastructure and networking,
    as it means the pace in which root cause analysis can be carried out improves.
    Having effective monitoring helps to facilitate the process of mean time to resolve,
    so when a production issue occurs, the source of the issue can be found quicker
    than numerous engineers logging onto consoles and servers trying to debug issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    to localize the source of the issue, silencing any resultant alarms that result
    from the initial root cause, allowing the issue to be highlighted and fixed efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The monitoring then hands over to the repeatable automation, which can then
    push out the localized fix to production. This process provides a highly accurate
    feedback loop, where processes will improve daily. If alerts are missed, they
    will ideally be built into the monitoring system over time as part of the incident
    post-mortem.

    which leads to happier customers, and results in improved uptime of products.
    Utilizing automation and effective monitoring also means that all members of a
    team have access to see how processes work and how fixes and new features are
    pushed out.

    of one where a key engineer needs to do the majority of tasks in the team as he
    is the most highly skilled individual and has all of the system knowledge stored
    in his head.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using a DevOps model means that the very highly skilled engineer can instead
    use their talents to help *cross skill* other team members and create effective
    monitoring that can help any team member carry out the root cause analysis they
    normally do manually. This builds the talented engineer's deep knowledge into
    the monitoring system, so the monitoring system as opposed to the talented engineer
    becomes the go-to point of reference when an issue first occurs, or ideally the
    monitoring system becomes the source of truth that alerts on events to prevent
    customer facing issues. To improve cross-skilling, the talented engineer should
    ideally help write automation too, so they are not the only member of the team
    that can carry out specific tasks.

    in siloed teams, interacting with other teams in large organizations via ticketing
    systems or using suboptimal processes. This is not a streamlined or optimized
    way of working, it is scenarios such as this which led to the DevOps initiative
    being started, that sought to break down barriers between *Development* and *Operations*
    staff, but its remit has since widened.

    yet, but software delivery can only operate as fast as the slowest component.
    The slowest component will eventually become the bottleneck or blocker of the
    entire delivery process. That slowest component often becomes the star engineer
    in a siloed team that can’t process enough tickets in a day manually to keep up
    with demand, thus becoming the bus factor of one. If that engineer takes a holiday
    or has a sick day, then work is blocked, the company becomes too reliant and cannot
    function efficiently without them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a team is not operating in the same way as the rest of the business, then
    all other departments will be slowed down as the siloed department is not agile
    enough. Put simply, the reason networking teams exist in most companies is to
    provide a service to development teams. Development teams require networking to
    be deployed, so they can test product changes and also deploy products to production,
    once deployed to production the business can start making money from those products.

    new subnets for new applications can no longer be deemed a success if they take
    days, months or even weeks. Networking has a direct impact on the *velocity of
    change*, *mean time to resolve*, *uptime,* as well as *the number of deployments*,
    which are four of the key performance indicators of a successful DevOps initiative.
    So networking needs to be included in a DevOps model by companies, otherwise all
    of these quantifiable benefits will become constrained.

    Networking** (**SDN**) can be used to provision network functions in the private
    and public cloud, it is no longer acceptable for network teams to not adapt their
    operational processes and learn new skills. But the caveat is that the evolution
    of networking has been quick, and they need the support and time to do this.
  prefs: []

    then no real quantifiable benefits will be felt by the organization. Cloud projects
    traditionally do not fail because of technology, cloud projects fail because of
    the incumbent operational models that hinder them from being a success. There
    is zero value to be had from building a brand new OpenStack private cloud, with
    its open set of extensible APIs to manage compute, networking, and storage if
    a company doesn’t change its operational model and allow end users to use those
    APIs to self-service their requests.

    paste then this doesn’t bring any real business value as the network engineer
    that cuts and pastes the slowest is the bottleneck. The company may as well stick
    with their current technology and processes as implementing a private cloud solution
    with manual processes will not result in speeding up time to market or mean time
    to recover from failure.
  prefs: []

    staff, as incumbent operational models in companies are typically not designed
    or set up by current staff, they are normally inherited. Moving to public cloud

    it is a quick fix and bandage that disguises the deeper rooted cultural challenges
    that exist.

    and monitoring can help network teams refine their internal processes and facilitate
    the developers and operations staff that they work with daily. Cultural change

    to buy in from the company to make changes to the operational model. These changes
    are required as the incumbent operational model is deemed suboptimal and not set
    up to deliver software at the speed of competitors, which inherently delays new
    products or crucial fixes from being delivered to market.

    that some ground work is done with the teams involved, if large changes are going
    to be made to the operational model, it can often cause unrest or stress to staff
    on the ground.
  prefs: []

    in of the people on the ground as they will operate within that model daily. Having
    teams buy in is a very important aspect; otherwise, the company will end up with
    an unhappy workforce, which will mean the best staff will ultimately leave.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    operational processes and deal with any concerns transparently from the outset,
    as opposed to going for an offsite management meeting and coming back with an
    enforced plan, which is all too common theme.
  prefs: []

    basis, what they like about the current processes and where their frustrations
    lie. The biggest impediment to changing an operational model is misunderstanding
    the current operational model. All initiatives should ideally be led and not enforced.

    has a proven template that works well, then that team could also be invaluable
    in helping facilitate cultural change within the networks team. It will be slightly
    more challenging if focus is put on an external team as the evangelist as it opens
    up excuses such as it being easier for them because of x, y, and z in their company.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is to embed a network engineer in that team for a few weeks and have them observe
    and give feedback how the other teams operate and document their findings. This
    is imperative, so the network engineers on the ground understand the processes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Flexibility is also important, as only some of the successful team’s processes
    may be applicable to a network team, so don’t expect two teams to work identically.
    The sum of parts and personal individuals in the team really do mean that every
    team is different, so focus on goals rather than the implementation of strict
    processes. If teams achieve the same outcomes in slightly different ways, then
    as long as work can be tracked and is visible to management, it shouldn’t be an
    issue as long as it can be easily reported on.

    are comfortable with new processes, so empower change agents in the network team
    to choose how they want to work by engaging with the team by creating new processes
    and also put them in charge of eventual tool selection. However, before selecting
    any tooling, it is important to start with process and agree on the new operational
    model to prevent tooling driving processes, this is a common mistake in IT.

    business process flows. In the example, we see a development team’s activity diagram.
    This process is suboptimal as it doesn’t include the quality assurance team in
    the **Test locally** and **Peer review** phases. Instead it has a formalized QA
    hand-off phase, which is very late in the development cycle, and a suboptimal
    way of working as it promotes a development and QA silo, which is a DevOps anti-pattern.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and creating automated tests, whereas the development team works on coding tasks.
    This would allow the development **Peer review** process to have a QA engineers’
    review and test developer code earlier in the development lifecycle and make sure
    that every piece of code written has appropriate test coverage before the code
    is checked in.
  prefs: []

    found by the quality assurance team or in production by customers, so mapping
    these streams of work into the activity diagram would also be useful to show all
    potential feedback loops.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    a breakdown in the process flow, so it is important to capture all permutations

    layer can be a box that simply says **Peer review**, which then references a nested

    teams as these are specific to their needs, so it’s important to give teams the
    flexibility they need at this level.

    details such as how an internal team’s **Peer review** process operates as this

    than a ticketed request that will hinder the velocity of change when it is done

    the new business process. So this removes the issue of an enforced model from
    management as those using it have been involved in creating it. The operational
    model can be iterated and improved over time, but interactions shouldn’t change
    greatly although new interaction points may be added that have been initially
    missed. A master copy of the business process can then be stored and updated,
    so anyone new joining the company knows exactly how to interact with other teams.
  prefs: []

    logging into admin consoles on network devices to make changes. Infrastructure
    engineers adjusted to automation as they already had scripting experience in **bash**

    systems, so transitioning to configuration management tooling was not a huge step.

    on hand can help network engineers make this transition.

    network engineers a day away from their day jobs and time to attempt to automate
    a small process, which is repeated everyday by network engineers. If possible,
    make this a mandatory exercise, so that the engineers have to participate and
    make other teams available to cover for the network team, so they aren’t distracted.
    This is a good way of seeing which members of the network team may be open to
    evangelizing DevOps and automation. If any particular individual stands out, then
    work with them to help push automation initiatives forward to the rest of the
    team by making them the champion for process automation.

    achievements is also a good way of promoting automation in network teams and this

    interesting things they have achieved each quarter and incentivize this too by
    allowing each team time off from their day job to attend if they participate.
    This leads to a sense of community and shows teams they are part of a bigger movement

    all the network automation for the network team. Ideally, it should be the networking
    team that evolves and adopts automation, so giving the network team a sense of

    full buy-in from networking teams and discipline not to revert back to manual
    tasks at any point even if issues occur.

    team from the infrastructure or developments teams, but this should only be a
    temporary measure. It is important to select an automation engineer that is respected
    by the network team and knowledgeable in networking, as no one should ever attempt
    to automate network processes that they cannot operate by hand, so having someone
    well-versed in networking to help with network automation is crucial, as they
    will be training the network team so have to be respected. If an automation engineer
    is assigned to the network team and isn’t knowledgeable or respected, then the
    initiative will likely fail, so choose wisely.
