<p>The next step in our cloud journey is PaaS, and we'll introduce Azure App Service. Azure App Service is the simplest example of Azure PaaS, and is intended to host web applications. We'll see how different hosting applications in IaaS and PaaS is.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Azure App Service Plans</li>
<li>Azure Web Apps</li>
<li>Traffic Manager</li>
<li>App service environment</li>

<p><span>PaaS</span> in Azure (or in any public cloud) is more abstract than IaaS. It's simple to understand the IaaS model because it's not much different from on-premises: we create a virtual machine, we configure it any way we want, we install anything we want (of course, limited by the OS itself; we can't install something that wouldn't run on-premises either).</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>After we create our Azure VM, we have complete control over everything on that VM. For example, the VMs created in the previous chapter were intended to be used as web servers. We can connect to that VM and install all the required roles, features, and software in order to start hosting our application. </p>
<p>But what if we want to do a similar thing with PaaS?</p>
<p>An Azure App Service Plan is used to host our web applications in Azure. We need to create an Azure App Service Plan and then add Azure Web Apps for our applications. A single App Service Plan can host multiple Azure Web Apps. If we install IIS on our web server, we can host multiple applications as well. An App Service Plan can be compered very much to IIS, but with one big difference: with IIS, we have complete control over configuration and with App Service Plan we have a limited set of options. This is essentially <span>the </span>difference between IaaS and PaaS.</p>
<p>With less control comes less maintenance, as many tasks that we needed to perform in an on-premises environment are now automated and we don't need to worry about them. For example, installing updates in a local environment must be performed regularly in order to keep everything up to date and secure. With PaaS, we don't need to install any updates as this is done automatically on <span>the </span>host level.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating an App Service Plan</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Let's start by creating a new App Service Plan. Similar to all Azure resources, we need to provide a name, <span class="packt_screen">Subscription</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Resource Group</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Location</span>. The other options available are <span class="packt_screen">Operating System</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Pricing tier</span>. The options available for OS are Windows and Linux. An example of all <span>the </span>information needed to create a new App Service Plan is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-348 image-border" src="Images/41a1f2b3-efad-4093-8541-0b946be61639.png" style="width:22.83em;height:43.50em;" width="401" height="763"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The default value for App Service Plan <span class="packt_screen">Pricing tier</span> is <span class="packt_screen">S1 Standard</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Standard 1</span>. If we change this value, a new blade will open with more options. The App Service Plan pricing blade is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-349 image-border" src="Images/b4cbfe4c-6313-4d05-a342-4678f0d7d686.png" style="width:48.83em;height:24.67em;" width="1576" height="795"/></p>
<p>App Service Plan pricing is divided into three sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Dev/Test</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Production</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Isolated</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Dev/Test</span> is intended for small workloads in dev/test environments. It has different sizes: <span class="packt_screen">F1</span>, <span class="packt_screen">D1</span>, and Basic (<span class="packt_screen">B1</span>, <span class="packt_screen">B2</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">B3</span>). <span class="packt_screen">F1</span> is free on shared infrstructure, has limited compute time per day, and doesn't support custom domains. <span class="packt_screen">D1</span> has more compute hours per day and support for custom domains. The Basic tier has dedicated infrastructure and has support for custom domains, SSL, and manual scaling.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Production</span> is intended for bigger workloads in a production environment. It comes with Standard and Premium tiers, which each have additional sizes (<span class="packt_screen">S1</span>, <span class="packt_screen">S2</span>, <span class="packt_screen">S3</span>, <span class="packt_screen">P1</span>, <span class="packt_screen">P2</span>, <span class="packt_screen">P3</span>, <span class="packt_screen">P1v2</span>, <span class="packt_screen">P2v2</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">P3v2</span>). All sizes in the production section bring additional features, like autoscale, slots, backup, and Traffic Manager support. The amount of resources available to an App Service Plan depends on size, as each size comes with a different amount of memory and number of cores. This also applies to <span>the </span>Basic tier, even though it's not intended for production. The main difference between the standard and premium tiers is disk type, as standard uses standard storage (HDD) and premium uses premium storage (SSD). Premium can also be <span class="packt_screen">v</span><span class="packt_screen">1</span> and <span class="packt_screen">v<span class="packt_screen">2</span></span>, where <span class="packt_screen">v</span><span class="packt_screen">2</span> has a different processor type and more memory.</p>
<p>After an App Service Plan is created, you can start adding Web Apps. It's important to say that you can add multiple Web Apps to a single App Service Plan. Billing is done on <span>the </span>App Service Plan level and you pay for <span>the entire </span>App Service Plan, not for each individual app. The number of apps that can be added to each App Service Plan depends on tier and size. </p>

            <article>
                
<p>To create a new Azure Web App, <span>the </span>standard values that need to be provided are <span class="packt_screen">App name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Subscription</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Resource Group</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Application Insights Location</span>. The other required values are <span class="packt_screen">OS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">App Service plan/Location</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Application Insights</span>. The available options for OS are <span class="packt_screen">Windows</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Linux</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Docker</span>. Values will depend on <span>the </span>type of application you want to run. In <span class="packt_screen">App Service plan/Location</span>, you can create a new App Service Plan or use an existing one.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">App Service plan/Location</span> will determine <span>the </span>location of your Web App, as it needs to be in <span>the </span>same location as <span>the </span>App Service Plan it's associated with. Finally, I encourage enabling <span class="packt_screen">Application Insights</span>, as this will allow you better monitoring and reporting regarding your application usage and performance.</p>
<p>An example of all the information needed to create a Web App is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-350 image-border" src="Images/b74a6380-8375-46f6-862f-5e9031fcba7f.png" style="width:21.83em;height:42.58em;" width="408" height="796"/></p>
<p>After deployment completes, we can see <span>the </span>following resources created: <span class="packt_screen">App Service</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span class="packt_screen">pla</span>n</span>, <span class="packt_screen">App Service</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Application Insights</span>. This can be a bit confusing because different names are used when creating resources and after they are actually created. App Service Plan is App Service Plan in both cases.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In <span>the </span>case of Web App, <span>the </span>name is different. When you want to create a new Web App, <span>the </span>blade will show <span>the </span>name Web App, but after it's created you will see it as App Service. To sum up, App Service Plan is referred as App Service Plan and Web App is referred to as both Web App and App Service:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-351 image-border" src="Images/dfb52210-3323-4318-a2a6-4e864ad77844.png" style="width:100.50em;height:15.25em;" width="1206" height="183"/></p>

<p>After <span>the </span>deployment of resources is completed, we need to configure them. As we don't have direct access and can't install software, roles, or features, we have an extended set of preconfigured settings that we can edit. There are more options in <span>the </span>App Service blade than in <span>the </span>Virtual Machine Blade, but overall we have fewer options as direct configuration isn't available. </p>
<p>Let's start with the Azure Web App and continue with configuration.</p>

<p>The first set of options available for an Azure Web App is deployment. <span class="packt_screen">Quickstart</span> offers us links to various documents and guides.</p>
<p>We can set <span>the</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span>D</span>eployment credentials</span> that will be used for deployment and FTP access:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-352 image-border" src="Images/801f8e06-9957-46dd-b8de-db701dd1e7eb.png" style="width:14.17em;height:14.83em;" width="277" height="291"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Deployment slots</span> is a very interesting feature which allows us to create multiple environments for our application. Slots are separate environments, but they can be used to swap application versions as well. To create a new slot, we select <span class="packt_screen">Add a slot</span> and then provide a <span class="packt_screen">Name</span> and a <span class="packt_screen">Configuration Source</span>. The <span><span class="packt_screen">Configuration Sourc</span>e</span> can be one of <span>the </span>existing slots (<span>the </span>configuration of <span>the </span>selected slot will be cloned), or we can select not to clone and leave <span>the </span>default values. A example of adding a new slot is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-353 image-border" src="Images/79fd5e65-27b0-45ca-9028-44a8e608356e.png" style="width:21.67em;height:41.08em;" width="401" height="761"/></p>
<p>The slot's name will be formed from the application name with <span>the </span>slot name added. For example, I created two slots: staging and test. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-354 image-border" src="Images/3392330f-93a8-4a4a-abed-4283600c5873.png" style="width:35.58em;height:14.42em;" width="641" height="260"/></p>
<p>A great feature is <span>the </span>option to swap slots. For example, we can have a production slot running and have all users pointed to this slot when using <span>the </span>application. We can deploy and test on different slots, and this will have no impact on <span>the </span>production version of <span>the </span>application that users are currently using. Once we have tested everything, we can deploy <span>the </span>new version to <span>the </span>staging slot. The option to swap slots allows us to switch between <span>the </span>old production version and <span>the </span>new version in a matter of seconds with minimal impact on our users. When we hit swap, everything in staging becomes production and <span>the </span>old production becomes staging. Settings between slots are not changed, so staging can use a different database than production, for example. Another great thing is that we can swap back as well. Even when we test and validate, users may experience problems and bugs in new versions of applications. In this case, we can simply switch back and return to <span>the </span>previous production version, moving it from staging to production and <span>the </span>new version from production to staging. This will allow users to continue using <span>the </span>last stable version of <span>the </span>application, while we can examine and troubleshoot in staging in order to resolve <span>the </span>issue. Once we resolve <span>the </span>issue, simply swap again and <span>the </span>new version is back in production.</p>
<p>An example of slot swapping is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-355 image-border" src="Images/87543d9d-66e5-4961-b575-b1fc311a847c.png" style="width:20.00em;height:37.58em;" width="404" height="759"/></p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Deployment option</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Deployment Center (Preview)</span> give you options to connect to a code repository. Most common repositories are default options, such as <span class="packt_screen">Visual Studio Team Services</span>, <span class="packt_screen">GitHub</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Bitbucket</span>. File shares like <span class="packt_screen">OneDrive</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Dropbox</span> are also an option and you can link to a custom external repository as well, like <span class="packt_screen">Local Git Repository</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Team Foundation Server</span>. The difference is that besides connecting a repository, <span class="packt_screen">Deployment Center</span> <span class="packt_screen">(Preview)</span><span> </span>gives you <span>the </span>option to establish a continuous integration/continuous delivery pipeline. <span class="packt_screen">Deployment option</span> sources are shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-356 image-border" src="Images/900fc5af-d96f-49ce-acf7-81aa954bab26.png" style="width:37.17em;height:34.58em;" width="845" height="785"/></p>

<p>Azure Web App settings have some similar features to other Azure services, such as properties and locks. Also, most Azure services have a <span class="packt_screen">Scale up (App Service plan) </span>and/or <span class="packt_screen">Scale out <span>(App Service plan)</span></span><span> </span>option. Some unique settings are <span class="packt_screen">Application settings</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Authentication/Authorization</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Application Insights</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Ma<span class="packt_screen">n</span></span><span class="packt_screen">aged service identity</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Backups</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Custom domains</span>, <span class="packt_screen">SSL settings</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Networking</span>, <span class="packt_screen">WebJobs</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Push</span> notifications, and <span class="packt_screen">MySQL In App</span>. The <span class="packt_screen">Networking</span> option allows us to connect a Web App to an Azure VNet, or even create a hybrid connection to our on-premises environment. <span class="packt_screen">WebJobs</span> allow us to create background processes that can be executed on a schedule or triggered by an event. <span class="packt_screen">Push</span> notifications are usually used for mobile applications in order to send various notifications to <span>the </span>mobile device where <span>the </span>application is running, like news, updates, and so on. <span class="packt_screen">MySQL In App</span> creates a MySQL instance that your application can use.</p>
<p>However, this is for small workloads and I don't recommend using this other than for development and testing. A list of all settings is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-357 image-border" src="Images/73e0f357-97a7-45ed-a1a2-a625a90a28da.png" style="width:15.08em;height:42.00em;" width="246" height="685"/></p>
<p>General settings have a preconfigured set of options which allow us to change framework versions and other settings needed for our application. For example, we can switch between different versions of .NET, PHP, Python, or Java. We can also switch between 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, turn Websockets on or off, set a managed pipeline version to classic or integrated, and so on.</p>
<p>One very important option is always on, and I strongly recommend you set this to <span class="packt_screen">On</span>. If <span>the </span>application isn't used for a period of time, it can take some time to establish <span>the </span>first connection. For example, if <span>the </span>application is used during working hours, it can take some time for first users to connect in the morning because <span>the </span>application wasn't used during <span>the </span>night. Setting <span class="packt_screen">Always On</span> will ping <span>the </span>application from time to time and keep it active. This way, whenever users try to connect, <span>the </span>application will be ready and there will be no wait time:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-358 image-border" src="Images/de238724-4a41-454b-8e47-43de1f479852.png" style="width:35.83em;height:35.17em;" width="682" height="670"/></p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Authentication/Authorization</span> option allows us to set up a user login for our application. The default option is anonymous access, but we can set up <span class="packt_screen">Azure Active Directory</span>, a <span class="packt_screen">Microsoft</span> Live account, <span class="packt_screen">Facebook</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Google</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Twitter</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Managed Service Identity</span> allows <span>the </span>application to be registered in <span class="packt_screen">Azure Active Directory</span> and use <span>the </span>registration to communicate with other applications in <span class="packt_screen">Azure Active Directory</span>. A list of <span class="packt_screen">Authentication Providers</span> in <span>the </span><span class="packt_screen">Authentication/Authorization</span> blade is shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-359 image-border" src="Images/385677a6-4fc8-44b8-8c50-8805265ffe5a.png" style="width:49.00em;height:26.08em;" width="1275" height="679"/></p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Backup</span> option allows us to create a backup for our application. We need to provide <span class="packt_screen">Storage Settings</span> (the storage account where the backup will be stored), backup schedule, and retention period. The default retention period is 30 days and <span>the </span>default schedule is daily, but you can change these settings. If you set up a connection to a code repository, this option is not really necessary as you can redeploy <span>the </span>application at any time, but it's a useful feature if you want a quick restore or if you don't use a code repository:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-360 image-border" src="Images/8399ee1f-19f5-4d71-addf-e815c576bdd7.png" style="width:46.00em;height:41.92em;" width="889" height="809"/></p>

<p>Custom domains and SSL settings allow us to customize <span>the </span>URL for our application and apply certificates to encrypt connections and increase security. These are directly connected as you can't apply a valid SSL certificate without a custom domain for your Web App.</p>
<p>An Azure Web App, by default, has <span>the </span>URL <kbd>customname.azurewebsites.net</kbd> (where in <kbd>customname</kbd> is <span>the </span>name you provided while creating <span>the </span>Web App). In order to simplify access, you can use a custom URL that you already own or you can buy a new domain. There is even <span>the </span>option to buy a new domain through <span>the </span>Azure portal, but <span>the </span>offer is not provided by Microsoft, but by partners. If you buy a new domain through the Azure portal, this will be added to your Azure bill.</p>
<p>In order to set up a custom domain, domain ownership needs to be verified. This is done by adding ether CNAME (<kbd>customname.azurewebsites.net</kbd><span>) or a record (Azure Web App IP address) on your DNS which will point your custom domain to the Azure Web App. Once verification is done, you just need to confirm that you want to use that domain for your Azure Web App. Also, you can set up your website to use HTTPS only to increase security, especially if you are using SSL. Information on CNAME and the IP addresses that need to be added to verify ownership, and later to be used to point to your website, can be found on this page:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-361 image-border" src="Images/50a52c1b-9712-4a56-ba78-c4e568780062.png" style="width:45.75em;height:24.58em;" width="769" height="414"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="packt_screen">SSL Configuration</span> allows us to set <span class="packt_screen">HTTPS Only</span> again. I strongly advise you to use this whenever possible. Another security option is <span class="packt_screen">Minimum TLS Version</span>, wherein you can choose between <span class="packt_screen">1.0</span>, <span class="packt_screen">1.1</span> and <span class="packt_screen">1.2</span>. It is recommended to use TLS <span class="packt_screen">1.2</span> as it may be reported insecure otherwise. The <span class="packt_screen">Bindings</span> option allows you to pair up a custom domain and available certificates. As you can have more custom domains point to a single website, all available domains with SSL will be shown in the list, as shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-362 image-border" src="Images/001af4c7-19de-48ff-b19c-16e246f43acd.png" style="width:48.50em;height:34.83em;" width="896" height="643"/></p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Certificates</span> section under SSL settings allows you to manage certificates for your website. You can either <span class="packt_screen">Import App Service Certificate</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Upload Certificate</span>. An App Service certificate is an option that allows you to buy a certificate through <span>the </span>Azure portal and use that certificate for your applications. This certificate will be available to all apps in <span>the </span>tenant. The <span class="packt_screen">Upload Certificate</span> option allows you to upload an existing certificate that you already have or have bought from an external source. Certificates will show under the public or private list, depending on the type of certificate you uploaded or imported. You can also request <span class="packt_screen">Client Certificates</span> if needed. All certificate options are shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-363 image-border" src="Images/b1ca8dc0-f0e0-4935-930d-bccc80c5ebd3.png" style="width:43.75em;height:23.75em;" width="881" height="479"/></p>
<p>Automatic scaling for Azure Web Apps is done similarly to a <strong>virtual machine scale set</strong> (<strong><span>VMSS</span></strong>). Under <span>the </span><span class="packt_screen">Scale out</span> section, you can find a blade that is identical to <span>the </span>scale out blade in VMSS. In order to configure scale out rules, you need to set up scale out and scale in parameters. For example, you can set up a web app to add an additional instance whenever <span>the </span>CPU goes over 70%, and then decrease <span>the </span>number of instances if <span>the </span>CPU goes under 25%. You can set up <span>the </span>minimum, maximum, and default number of instances. Additional scale out and scale in rules can be added that will perform a scale in/out depending on different metrics. This will allow you to save money and run <span>the </span>minimum number of instances needed without suffering performance issues. An example of scale conditions is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Azure Web Apps have some unique tools that are specific to this service: <span class="packt_screen">DEVELOPMENT TOOLS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">MOBILE</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">API</span>.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen"><span>DEVELOPMENT TOOLS</span></span> start with <span>the </span><span class="packt_screen">Clone app</span> option, which allows us to create a new instance of <span>the </span>Web App that will be an identical replica of <span>the </span>existing app. However, this option is limited only to <span>the </span><span class="packt_screen">Premium tier</span>, and if you are using any other tier, this option will not be available unless you upgrade. Console gives you web access to <span>the </span>console, where you can browse files and perform actions on the command line.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Advanced Tools</span> opens an additional window that contains a few different options, like debug console, process explorer, resource explorer, and different information for debugging and deployment. We can also add extensions to our Web App and choose hundreds of different extensions from the gallery in <span>the s</span>ite extensions section.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">App Service Editor (Preview)</span> allows you web access to <span>the </span>code editor, wherein you can make live changes to application code without any additional tools. <span class="packt_screen">Performance test</span> allows you to perform load tests on your app and see how it would handle any amount of concurrent users. <span class="packt_screen">Resource explorer</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Extensions</span> are <span>the </span>options available in <span>the </span>advanced tools that we talked about.</p>
<p>A very interesting option is <span class="packt_screen">Testing in production</span>. It requires <span>the </span>use of slots and allows you to redirect a percentage of users to a different slot for user testing. For example, we deployed a new version of <span>the </span>application to <span>the </span>staging slot. Using this feature, we can point 10% of users to this slot in order to verify that <span>the </span>application is working as expected. Once we verify that 10% of <span>the </span>users don't have any issues, we can increase this to 25%, then to 50%, and then finally switch all users to <span>the </span>new version. A list of all development tools is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-365 image-border" src="Images/2f9c92e9-4a41-41cd-819b-5a44bb354486.png" style="width:14.83em;height:22.83em;" width="269" height="415"/></p>
<p>The other sections available are <span><span class="packt_screen">MOBILE</span></span>, <span class="packt_screen">API</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">MONITORING</span>: </p>
<ul>
<li><span><span class="packt_screen">MOBILE</span>: This </span>has three options which are intended to be used for mobile applications. These options are <span class="packt_screen">Easy tables</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Easy APIs</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Data connections</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Data connections</span> defines a connection to the Azure SQL database and is also a requirement for <span class="packt_screen">Easy tables</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Easy APIs</span>. Both <span class="packt_screen">Easy tables</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Easy APIs</span> require mobile extension to be installed on your Web App.</li>
<li><span><span class="packt_screen">API</span>: </span>The <span class="packt_screen">API</span> section contains API Definitions and CORS. <span><span class="packt_screen">API</span> <span class="packt_screen">definition</span> lets you configure the location of the Swagger 2.0 metadata describing your API. This makes it easy for others to discover and consume your API. Note that the URL can be a relative or absolute path, but must be publicly accessible. <strong>Cross-Origin Resource Sharing</strong> (<strong>CORS</strong>) allows JavaScript code running in a browser on an external host to interact with your backend.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><span><span class="packt_screen">MONITORING</span>: This </span>is available for other resources, and we already covered most of these options. The options available for monitoring are <span class="packt_screen">Alerts (Classic)</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Diagnostic logs</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Log stream</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Process explorer</span>. In <span class="packt_screen">Diagnostic logs</span>, you can set the level of logs you want to save. <span class="packt_screen">Log stream</span> gives you the option to observe logs live. The list of options in the <span><span class="packt_screen">MOBILE</span></span>, <span class="packt_screen">API</span>, and <span><span class="packt_screen">MONITORING </span></span>sections is shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<p>The default options for monitoring Azure Web Apps can be useful, but it's only <span>the </span>beginning of <span>the </span>Web App monitoring options. If you want a really powerful tool for monitoring and alerting with dashboards and analytics, Application Insights is <span>the </span>tool you want to use. Application Insights can be created and linked to a Web App while creating <span>the </span>Web App or later.</p>
<p>Also, you can use a single Application Insight to monitor multiple Azure Web Apps. It's interesting that Application Insights is not limited to Azure Web Apps, but can be used with an application hosted anywhere, including other cloud providers or an on-premises data center.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Application Insights</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>A first look at Application Insights gives you a few dashboards that show basic information on requests, response time, and availability for your application in <span>the </span>last two hours. These dashboards can be customized with different time frames and to show different metrics altogether. An example of <span class="packt_screen">App Insights</span> dashboards is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-367 image-border" src="Images/85093542-3db9-476f-bfe8-906c132f7e4d.png" style="width:48.08em;height:37.50em;" width="876" height="683"/></p>
<p>The first set of options under <span class="packt_screen">Application Insight</span>s is under <span>the </span><span class="packt_screen">INVESTIGATE</span> section. In this section, we have multiple metric options which allow us to track different performance counters and dependencies. Most of these options can be edited and we can extract specific information, as well as create custom dashboards and alerts. Some of these metrics can be collected only if <span>the </span>Application Insight SDK is installed on your application. A list of all options under <span>the <span class="packt_screen">INVESTIGATE </span></span>section is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-368 image-border" src="Images/4937a4de-9b14-4922-8e16-db2e025b44bb.png" style="width:15.58em;height:40.58em;" width="237" height="618"/></p>
<p>An example of one of these alerts is availability. We can create a test that will continuously test our application from different locations in order to confirm that <span>the </span>application is available.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We can edit test frequency, test locations, success criteria, and alerts. If <span>the </span>default settings are used, <span>the </span>application will be pinged every 5 minutes from five different locations. In case three or more locations fail to contact <span>the </span>application, an alert will be triggered and a notification will be sent. An example of an availability test is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-369 image-border" src="Images/f2041e16-ae29-427b-afca-35482d21d23e.png" style="width:21.00em;height:47.50em;" width="359" height="811"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">USAGE</span> section contains various information on <span class="packt_screen">Users</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Sessions</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Events</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">User Flows</span>. To get metrics in this section, you need to use the Application Insight JavaScript SDK and add JavaScript code snippets to your application. A list of all options under users is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-370 image-border" src="Images/aed7b452-8862-4c8e-a850-b09d9cf38698.png" style="width:10.17em;height:27.58em;" width="149" height="405"/></p>
<p>Here is an example of a code snippet that needs to be added to an application in order to collect usage information:</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- To collect end-user usage analytics about your application, insert the following script into each page you want to track. Place this code immediately before the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag, and before any other scripts. Your first data will appear automatically in just a few seconds. --&gt; &lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt; var appInsights=window.appInsights||function(a){ function b(a){c[a]=function(){var b=arguments;c.queue.push(function(){c[a].apply(c,b)})}}var c={config:a},d=document,e=window;setTimeout(function(){var b=d.createElement("script");b.src=a.url||"https://az416426.vo.msecnd.net/scripts/a/ai.0.js",d.getElementsByTagName("script")[0].parentNode.appendChild(b)});try{c.cookie=d.cookie}catch(a){}c.queue=[];for(var f=["Event","Exception","Metric","PageView","Trace","Dependency"];f.length;)b("track"+f.pop());if(b("setAuthenticatedUserContext"),b("clearAuthenticatedUserContext"),b("startTrackEvent"),b("stopTrackEvent"),b("startTrackPage"),b("stopTrackPage"),b("flush"),!a.disableExceptionTracking){f="onerror",b("_"+f);var g=e[f];e[f]=function(a,b,d,e,h){var i=g&amp;&amp;g(a,b,d,e,h);return!0!==i&amp;&amp;c["_"+f](a,b,d,e,h),i}}return c }({ instrumentationKey:"ebfab75c-e0ea-4d45-8aa9-ac11e656e644" }); window.appInsights=appInsights,appInsights.queue&amp;&amp;0===appInsights.queue.length&amp;&amp;appInsights.trackPageView(); &lt;/script&gt;</pre>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">CONFIGURE</span> section has a lot of settings that are already included in other Application Insights settings (such as <span class="packt_screen">Smart Detection settings</span>) and Azure Web Apps settings (such as <span class="packt_screen">Performance Testing</span>). The most interesting features are <span class="packt_screen">API Access</span> (which allows you to manage API keys that allow other applications to access APIs on your Azure Web App) and <span class="packt_screen">Work Items</span> (which allow you to connect to Visual Studio Team Services and link work items directly to your application). A list of settings under <span>the </span>configuration section in Application Insights is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-371 image-border" src="Images/38897b08-b3bb-4f14-97f5-7b780efb246a.png" style="width:14.83em;height:34.92em;" width="237" height="558"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="packt_screen">APPLICATION INSIGHTS</span> logs a lot of different metrics. You can create custom queries to get different kinds of information in <span class="packt_screen">Application Insights Analytics</span>. The results of these queries can be displayed as a table or as a chart. A screenshot of <span class="packt_screen">Application Insight Analytics</span> is shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-372 image-border" src="Images/6bb24688-a954-4e16-af3c-9a42123b58d8.png" style="width:157.83em;height:38.58em;" width="1894" height="463"/></p>
<p>Here is an example of an Application Insights query:</p>
<div>
<pre>requests<br/>| where timestamp &gt;= ago(24h)<br/>| summarize percentiles(duration, 50, 90, 95) by bin(timestamp, 1h)<br/>| render timechart</pre></div>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Azure App Service Plan</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>In the process of creating an Azure Web App, we needed to create an Azure App Service Plan. Let's take a step back and go over the settings available in <span>the </span>Azure App Service Plan.</p>
<p>Under <span class="packt_screen">SETTINGS</span>, we have some options that are available in Azure Web Apps, such as <span class="packt_screen">Networking</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Scale up (App Service plan)</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Scale out <span>(App Servic</span><span>e plan)</span></span>. <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Locks</span>, and an <span class="packt_screen">Automation script</span> are available as well, as in all other Azure resources. Note that an App Service Plan can host multiple Azure Web Apps. Billing is done for an Azure App Service Plan; you don't pay per Web App. So, tier changes on an Azure Web App are directly connected to tier changes in <span>the </span>Azure App Service Plan. Scale up/down and scale in/out operations done in <span>the </span>Web App blade will be shown here as <span>the</span> tier will not change for <span>the </span>Azure Web App, but for <span>the </span>Azure App Service Plan.</p>
<p>A list of all options under settings in <span>the </span>Azure App Service Plan is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-373 image-border" src="Images/a157b3c1-9ee3-4105-b237-31da7938d013.png" style="width:15.25em;height:26.08em;" width="234" height="401"/></p>
<p>On of <span>the </span>things that is different and unique for an Azure App Service Plan is Apps. As already mentioned, more Azure Web Apps can be hosted on a single Azure App Service Plan. The Apps option under settings has all these Web Apps listed, along with any slots that are created under these Web Apps. An example of an app list is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-374 image-border" src="Images/8faf6435-5c52-4a30-8d21-4731e2a099bb.png" style="width:87.50em;height:15.25em;" width="1050" height="183"/></p>
<p>Another different option is file system storage. Every Azure App Service Plan has resource limitations. Under <span class="packt_screen">File system storage</span>, we have information on how much total and free space is available. A screenshot of <span class="packt_screen">File system storage</span> is shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-375 image-border" src="Images/f87d8224-7b71-40c0-8275-57e773b4305e.png" style="width:41.50em;height:30.67em;" width="1009" height="746"/></p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Azure Web App high availability </h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We have already seen how to set up automatic scaling for Azure Web Apps and how to create scale in and out rules. But scaling can improve performance and keep <span>the </span>application up if there is an increase in requests and doesn't really secure <span>the </span>high availability of <span>the </span>application. If there is an issue in <span>the </span>Azure Data Center where the application is located, or maintenance on the host is in progress, <span>the </span>application will be unavailable if hosted in a single location. </p>
<p>In order to achieve high availability, we need to introduce another Azure service: Traffic Manager. Azure Traffic Manager operates on <span>the </span>DNS level to direct incoming requests to endpoints based on custom routing rules.</p>
<p><span>Let's start with creating a new Azure Traffic Manager and go through the configuration to show how to set up high availability for Azure Web Apps.</span></p>


            </article>

            
        </section>

<div id="sbo-rt-content"><section>

                            <header>
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a Traffic Manager</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To create a new Azure Traffic Manager, we need to provide <span>the </span>name, routing method, subscription resource group, and location. The location will be automatically chosen if an existing resource group is used. One option that is specific to Traffic Manager is the routing method, and <span>the </span>available options are performance, weighted, priority, and geographical.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Performance</span> option is used when you want to point a user to a location that will provide <span>the </span>best performance based on response time, network latency, and so on.</p>
<p>Weighted will distribute requests evenly or according to weight rules. For example, <span>the </span>default rule will distribute it evenly, and if we have two endpoints defined then half <span>the </span>requests will go to one endpoint and <span>the </span>other half to <span>the </span>second endpoint. But weight rules can be defined to have one endpoint receive 70% (or any other number) of requests, and <span>the </span>rest will be sent to <span>the </span>second endpoint. Of course, you can have more than two endpoints defined (two is <span>the </span>minimum) and create rules to weight any ratio you want.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Geographical</span> option will point users to <span>the </span>closest geographical location. For example, we can have two endpoints which are located in West Europe and East US. If <span>the </span>geographical routing method is used, users coming from Europe will be pointed to <span>the </span>endpoint in West Europe and users coming from <span>the </span>USA will be pointed to East US.</p>
<p>Finally, <span>the </span>priority routing method is usually used when high availability is <span>the </span>goal. One endpoint will be used as <span>the </span>primary endpoint, so all traffic will be pointed only to <span>the </span>primary endpoint. In case <span>the </span>primary endpoint becomes unavailable, all traffic will be pointed to <span>the </span>secondary instance. Of course, you can have more than only two endpoints. More endpoints ensures a bigger chance that at least one endpoint will be available and this increases <span>the </span>high availability percentage. </p>
<p>In some cases, <span>the </span>performance method can be used to achieve a similar goal <span>to endpoint tracking, </span>and users are pointed to <span>the </span>one that will perform best in a given situation. If <span>the </span>endpoint is unavailable, this will be reflected as a drop in performance and users will be directed to another endpoint that is giving better results. An issue with this approach is that the performance drop can take time to be detected, and users may experience issues until <span>the </span>performance of <span>the </span>endpoint is recognized to be down and they are redirected to a different endpoint. With <span>the </span>priority method, <span>the </span>availability of <span>the </span>endpoint is monitored, an issue is detected much faster, and users are pointed to a healthy instance faster and with lesser chance of experiencing issues. </p>
<p>An example of a filled template used to create a new Azure Traffic Manager is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Once an Azure Traffic Manager is created, we can proceed with configuration. The <span class="packt_screen">SETTINGS</span> specific to Traffic Manager are <span class="packt_screen">Configuration</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Real user measurements</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Traffic view</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Endpoints</span>.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Real user measurements</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Traffic view</span> allow you to monitor behavior and see where users <span>are</span><span> </span><span>pointed and how traffic is flowing. <span class="packt_screen">Traffic view</span> will give you insights into where requests </span><span>are</span><span> </span><span>coming from, using a map and pointing to request origins geographically. <span class="packt_screen">Real user measurements</span> can give you more insight into requests and traffic, but requires a measurement key and JavaScript snippet to be embedded in <span>the </span>application code:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-377 image-border" src="Images/c571eb3f-2b4a-4ff5-a3e5-b245e6a73e45.png" style="width:13.08em;height:30.50em;" width="232" height="541"/></p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Endpoint</span> option allows you to register endpoints toward which traffic will be directed. These can be either Azure endpoints or external endpoints. In the case of external endpoints, o<span>nly <strong>fully qualified domain name</strong> (<strong>FQDN</strong>) is allowed. For <span class="packt_screen">Azure endpoints</span>, it can be <span class="packt_screen">Cloud Service</span>, <span class="packt_screen">App Service</span>, <span class="packt_screen">App Service slot</span>, or <span class="packt_screen">Public IP address</span>. This is another example of naming that creates confusion. <span class="packt_screen">App Service</span> and the <span class="packt_screen">App Service slot</span> are actually Web App and the Web App slot in this case. An example of adding an Azure Web App (<span class="packt_screen">App Service</span>) is shown in the following screenshot:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-378 image-border" src="Images/b0bfe55b-0643-45db-9534-fde60f7fe4c4.png" style="width:36.92em;height:38.00em;" width="772" height="795"/></p>
<p>Having only one endpoint doesn't really help us to achieve high availability, and we need at least one more endpoint. I recommend that <span>the </span>second endpoint is located in a different region to resolve possible issues with maintenance or service in a single data center. A list of all available endpoints is located under <span class="packt_screen">Endpoints</span>, with <span class="packt_screen">NAME</span>, <span class="packt_screen">STATUS</span>, <span class="packt_screen">TYPE</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">LOCATION</span>. An example is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-379 image-border" src="Images/0c976a41-0009-4bb2-b2fa-cbf6aa76364d.png" style="width:89.17em;height:12.83em;" width="1070" height="154"/></p>
<p>The last step is to create rules under configuration. Note that we can change <span>the </span>routing method here, and this option can be changed after creating a Traffic Manager. This isn't the case with all Azure resources, and some settings can't be changed once you create them. For example, no resource in Azure can be renamed: <span>the </span>only option is to delete it and create a new one if a name change is required. Under <span>the</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span>E</span>ndpoint monitoring settings</span>, you can choose <span>the</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span>P</span>rotocol</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Port</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Path</span> that you want to monitor. </p>
<p>Finally, <span>the</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span>F</span>ast endpoint failover settings</span> need to be configured. The <span class="packt_screen">Probing interval</span> can be set to <span class="packt_screen">10</span> or <span class="packt_screen">30</span> seconds, and this determines how often endpoint status will be checked. <span class="packt_screen">Tolerated number of failures</span> can be set to <kbd>0</kbd>-<kbd>9</kbd>, and this determines how many times a check can fail before <span>the </span>endpoint is declared failed. <span class="packt_screen">Probe timeout</span> determines <span>the </span>time needed before <span>the </span>probe times out. This value needs to be at least <kbd>5</kbd>, and less than <span>the </span>probing interval time. Lower numbers for these settings mean that issues will be detected faster and failover will occur before an issue is detected by users. However, you need to be careful, as pinging <span>the </span>application more often than needed and declaring too few tolerated failures can cause <span>the </span>application to switch between instances too often and create additional issues. An example configuration is shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Azure Web Apps use public endpoints and are usually accessed over <span>the </span>internet without any restrictions. In a case where more isolated access is needed, there is another option: <strong>Azure App Service Environment</strong> (<strong>ASE</strong>). Azure ASE offers a fully isolated and dedicated environment for secure applications at high scale. Azure ASE is usually used with workloads that require very high scale, isolated and secure network access, and high memory utilization. As ASE comes as a dedicated environment, this eliminates <span>the </span>problem of noisy neighbors (performance issues that may result from another application sharing <span>the </span>same host) and allow you to fully utilize all resources.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>An Azure App Service Plan can be connected to an Azure VNet, but this requires additional work. On other hand, ASE comes automatically connected to a VNet and can be accessed only over private connections and private IP addresses.</p>

<p>An Azure App Service Plan is <span>the</span> best example of <span>the PaaS</span> model in Microsoft Azure. It allows us to host applications without servers and virtual machines. Even though management options are simplified and cut down to <span>the </span>minimum, we still have a lot of configuration options. Legacy support is next to nothing, but <span>the </span>PaaS model is intended for modern applications that require <span>the </span>latest features and frameworks. If you need to run legacy software, IaaS is <span>the </span>best choice. </p>
<p>We introduced IaaS and PaaS in Azure from <span>the </span>application perspective. But <span>the </span>application is nothing without data. In <span>the </span>next chapter, we'll move to Data Platform in Azure and show how to create and manage databases in <span>the </span>cloud.</p>
