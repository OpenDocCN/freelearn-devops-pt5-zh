    to add custom fields to the screens.

    Though the notation is for Atlassian **Data Center** and **Server**, the graphics
    and descriptions are still relevant for **Jira** **Cloud**.

- en: In this chapter, we learned how to create new custom fields, attach them to
    an existing screen, and configure the layout of the screen to place the fields
    in the appropriate sections. All of this allows for a smoother user experience,
    as fields can appear in a context that makes more sense. We have also seen how
    to configure our custom fields so that they are not a drain on system resources
    by linking each to a project and/or issue type.
