When it comes to learning, a roadmap helps you in giving a definitive path for progressing towards the goal. So, here you're presented with a roadmap before you begin your journey.</p><p class="calibre8">This book is meticulously designed and developed in order to empower you with all the right and relevant information on DevOps. We've created this Learning Path for you that consists of four lessons:</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 1. Introduction to DevOps" href="part0008_split_000.html#7K4G1-9e1d43bf5c22491b83b15944fc98f0e3">Lesson 1</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">Introduction to DevOps</em></span>, focuses on business trends, drivers, market propellers of evolution, and adoption of DevOps. The key technological concepts are introduced for big data, cloud, data sciences, and in-memory computing. You will also get to know DevOps application scenarios and the benefits of adoption for an organization.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 2. DevOps Framework" href="part0014_split_000.html#DB7S1-9e1d43bf5c22491b83b15944fc98f0e3">Lesson 2</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">DevOps Framework</em></span>, covers source code management, build, repository, release managements, and test automation. Continuous integration, delivery, deployment is also covered along with infrastructure automation for configuration (Infrastructure as Code), application monitoring, and so on.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 3. DevOps – Continuous Integration and Delivery" href="part0019_split_000.html#I3QM2-9e1d43bf5c22491b83b15944fc98f0e3">Lesson 3</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">DevOps – Continuous Integration and Delivery</em></span>, describes the CI/CD methodology with open source popular tools such as Git, Maven, Gerrit, Nexus, Selenium, and Jenkins. You will also learn different tools and plugins compatible with Jenkins.</p><p class="calibre8">
<a class="calibre1" title="Chapter 4. DevOps Continuous Deployment" href="part0032_split_000.html#UGI02-9e1d43bf5c22491b83b15944fc98f0e3">Lesson 4</a>, <span class="strong"><em class="calibre9">DevOps Continuous Deployment</em></span>, shows the popular continuous deployment tools Ansible and Chef; their advanced features such as Habitat, Automate, and Compliance for security. You will go through the core components, architecture, and terminology of Chef, cookbooks knife, Playbooks, and towers. You will also understand how to improve the code quality by using continuous monitoring tools such as Splunk and Nagios.</p></div></div>
