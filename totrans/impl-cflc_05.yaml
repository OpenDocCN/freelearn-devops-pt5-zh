    dynamic pages effectively.

    can make the pages dynamic. In addition, thanks to the labels, you can effortlessly
    find the specific page you are looking for in an environment with hundreds or
    thousands of pages. For example, you can filter pages that have a specific label.
    You can also utilize filters while searching.

    or more previously created labels to the page. However, you can also add a brand
    new label to a page. When you do this, a new label is created. This label can
    also be used on other pages within your Confluence site. This way, your newly
    created label will be available for other spaces too.

    the first is to add a macro through the Atlassian Marketplace, and the other is
    to develop your macro from scratch. In this section, we will share practical information
    about both options.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, we will discuss Smart Links, a relatively new feature. Smart
    Links make integrating a Confluence page with other systems straightforward. By
    using Smart Links, viewing content from supported programs as if you were inside
    the Confluence page is possible. For example, you can safely add a Miro visual
    to a Confluence page. Smart Links allow you to work with other programs without
    using any plugins. They are also very effective in making Confluence pages dynamic
    if used well. This is why we recommend you experiment a lot with Smart Links.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smart Links is a new feature. While there was no Smart Links feature, we used
    to use plugins downloaded from the Atlassian Marketplace or develop software from
    scratch for such integrations. Smart Links have largely made these plugins and
    software development efforts unnecessary.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Smart Links work on the following principle – when you add a link to a Confluence
    page, the content where that link goes is examined. If Atlassian supports the
    system hosting the content, that content can be viewed as if it were inside the
    Confluence page. Many problems related to this integration, especially information
    security, are solved thanks to Smart Links.

    have a serious infrastructure behind them. Major platforms, such as Google Drive
    and Miro, are supported by Smart Links. Although it is unlikely, not all links
    you add may be supported by Smart Links. However, knowing that Atlassian is increasing
    the amount of systems supported by Smart Links is helpful. Behind Smart Links
    lies a fundamental feature of Confluence (and all Atlassian products) – Atlassian
    products emphasize safe and easy integration with other products.

- en: In this chapter, we gained significant experience with Confluence. First, we
    talked about dynamic content. We’ve seen different ways to make pages dynamic.
    We learned the concept of labels, the purpose of labels, and how they are used.
    Then, we covered macros. We saw the basic logic of macros, and then we examined
    the selected macros individually. Finally, we discovered different ways to enrich
    Confluence’s rich macro library.
