<p class="calibre3">In the previous chapters, we looked at how to use Jira for both Scrum and Kanban agile methodologies. Jira comes with a set of tools to support these two methodologies, as well as sensible defaults to get you up and running quickly. However, you will often need to customize what comes out of the box by default in order to better suit your needs. In this chapter, we will go over some of the important options Jira Software provides so it can better adapt to the way you need to run your projects. We will also expand on some of the hybrid methodologies Jira Software offers, where you can combine the best of both Scrum and Kanban.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of the chapter, you will have learned how to:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Manage your Scrum board's configuration</li>
<li class="calibre9">Control which issues are to be included on your board</li>
<li class="calibre9">Customize your Scrum board's column layouts</li>
<li class="calibre9">Use swimlanes to group your issues</li>
<li class="calibre9">Filter issues on your Scrum board with quick filters</li>
<li class="calibre9">Combine the power of Scrum and Kanban with Scrumban and Kanplan</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre3">When you first create an agile board using Jira's built-in templates for either Scrum or Kanban, as outlined in the previous chapters, the board is created with a set of default settings, and you as the person who created the board will be automatically set as the board's administrator.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As the administrator, you can further customize the agile board in many ways, including:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Scope of the board—what projects/issues will be included on the board</li>
<li class="calibre9">Permission of the board—who will have access to the board</li>
<li class="calibre9">Layout of the board—the board's vertical columns and horizontal swimlanes</li>
<li class="calibre9">Customized filters—additional ways to filter out contents on the board</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">First of all, to start customizing your agile board:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Go to the agile board you want to customize.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Board drop-down menu and select the Configure option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select General from the left-hand navigation menu. As you can see from the following screenshot, the INFRA board has two administrators set. You can add and remove administrators by simply hovering over the field and updating the values:</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Controlling board scope</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">When we talk about the scope of your agile board, we are referring to the issues that will be included on your board. If you have created your board while creating a new project or have taken it from an existing project, then the scope of your board will be the selected project, meaning all issues from the project will be available for the board to display.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The way Jira controls the scope of a board is by using what is called a <strong class="calibre1">saved filter</strong>. A saved filter is a search query that has been saved in the system, and the issues returned from the result of the query are the issues that will be included on the board. When you create a board from a project, a new saved filter is automatically created for you, with its query parameter set to the selected project. For example, as shown in the following screenshot, the INFRA board is created from the Infrastructure Support project, so Jira has automatically created a saved filter called Filter for INFRA board with the filter query set to <kbd class="calibre12">project = INFRA ORDER BY Rand ASC</kbd>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This saved filter is effectively saying, <em class="calibre2">all issues with their project set to the project key INFRA will be included in this board, and they will be ordered by the Rank field in ascending order</em>:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone56" src="img/00060.jpeg"/></div>
<p>The Saved Filter is a standard Jira feature used in areas other than agile boards. It uses the <strong class="calibre26">Jira Query Language</strong> (<strong class="calibre26">JQL</strong>). You can find out more about JQL at <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver073/advanced-searching-861257209.html" class="calibre21">https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver073/advanced-searching-861257209.html</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can change the scope of your board by either changing the actual saved filter's query by clicking the Edit Filter Query link, or by using a different saved filter. Note that in order for you to change the current saved filter's query; you need to have the required permission. So if you do not have permission, then your best option is to create a new saved filter and set your board to use that instead. We will cover filter permissions in the next section.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Managing board permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In the previous section, we learned that Jira uses saved filters to determine which issues will be included on an agile board. Now let us take a look at how to manage the access permissions of a board.</p>
<p class="calibre3">There are two key permission levels when it comes to accessing an agile board, illustrated as follows:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Accessing the board itself—based on the saved filter</li>
<li class="calibre9">Accessing the issues on the board—based on project permission</li>
</ul>
<div><img class="alignnone57" src="img/00061.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Access to an agile board is controlled by the permission set on the saved filter or who the filter is shared with. If a user has access to the filter, then the user will have access to the board. For a filter that is automatically created as part of the board, it is set to be shared with all members of the project. If you are the owner of the filter, you can click on the Edit Filter Shares link and then choose who to share the filter with, as shown in the following screenshot. For this particular filter, it is shared with all members of the <kbd class="calibre12">Sample Scrum Project</kbd>:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone58" src="img/00062.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">The saved filter determines access to the agile board, and then it is up to each of the project's permissions to determine whether a user should be allowed to view its issues. This means that if a user has access to a saved filter, but does not have the necessary permission to access the project, then the user will be looking at an empty board with no issues on it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since a saved filter can have more than one project, the agile board will list all the projects that are part of it in the Project in board section, and if you are an administrator of a project, you can click on the View permission link to review and update its permissions. We will be covering permissions in <a href="part0091.html#2MP360-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre11">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre2">Customizing Jira Software</em> as it is a complicated topic. For now, suffice it to say that if a user is able to access an agile board, but is not able to view all its issues, then this is due to project permission settings.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Enabling ranking</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Ranking allows you to prioritize your issues by dragging and dropping them into your backlog and sprints. The higher an issue is in the ranking, the more important it is. If ranking is disabled, you will get an error message similar to <kbd class="calibre12">Ranking is disabled, as the Filter Query for this board is not ordered by Rank</kbd>, when you try to drag your issues in the backlog.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you have created your agile board by using the agile templates with either the new project or existing project option, then ranking will be enabled by default. However, if it is disabled for some reason, you can enable ranking by following these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Go to the agile board you want to customize.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Board drop-down menu and select the Configure option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select General from the left-hand navigation menu.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Click on the Add Rank button at the bottom to enable ranking:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone59" src="img/00063.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After you have enabled ranking, you will notice that your Filter Query value is automatically updated. So, in the preceding screenshot, the query <kbd class="calibre12">project = "Sample Scrum Project"</kbd> will be changed to <kbd class="calibre12">project = "Sample Scrum Project" ORDER BY Rank ASC</kbd>. Make sure you do not remove the <kbd class="calibre12">ORDER BY Rank ASC</kbd> part of the query, as that is the snippet that enables ranking for your query and board.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Customizing your board's layout</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Jira's agile board acts as the white board where all your story cards are placed. There are two key components that make up the board, namely the columns and swimlanes:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Columns</strong>: The vertical columns that are used to represent the state of a story card</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Swimlanes</strong>: The horizontal rows that help you to better categorize your story cards on the board</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In the following sections, we will take a deeper look into these two components and how you, as the board administrator, can customize them to get the most out of your board.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Working with columns</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Columns represent the statuses that an issue can be in. On a simple board, as shown in the following screenshot, we have three columns, and they are each mapped to an issue status:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">To Do: Issues that are waiting in the queue to be worked on are mapped to the To Do workflow status</li>
<li class="calibre9">In Progress: Issues that are currently being worked on are mapped to the In Progress workflow status</li>
<li class="calibre9">Done: Issues that are completed are mapped to the Done workflow status:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class="alignnone60" src="img/00064.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">This is a very simple setup where issues only have three steps from start to finish. Often, you will have an existing workflow that is more complex than this.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Jira and workflow</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Before we get into customizing columns, we first need to take a quick look at workflows in relation to Jira. As you may already know, Jira uses workflows to move an issue from one status to the next. Jira also leverages this feature by mapping its columns to workflow statuses. However, if you are not familiar with how workflow works in Jira, do not worry—we will cover workflows in detail in <a href="part0091.html#2MP360-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre11">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre2">Customizing Jira Software</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since workflows in Jira can often get very complicated, it is sometimes difficult to use the traditional Jira workflows in an agile environment. So Jira introduced what is known as the <strong class="calibre1">agile simplified workflow</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Agile simplified workflow refers to workflows that are managed directly from within Jira that are simplified and streamlined for agile usage.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This allows you to:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Maintain your workflow from your agile board, managed as board columns</li>
<li class="calibre9">Move issues freely from one status (column) to another without restrictions from workflow conditions and validators</li>
<li class="calibre9">Not have intermediate screens where you move issues between statuses, making it much easier to move cards (issues) on your boards</li>
<li class="calibre9">Automatically set resolution values (as per your definition) when issues are moved to appropriate statuses (columns)</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">If you have created your agile board by using the built-in agile templates, then you are most likely using an agile simplified workflow.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating new columns</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you are the board administrator, you can customize the board's columns to better reflect your workflow:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Navigate to the Scrum board that you want to customize.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Board drop-down menu and select the Configure option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select Columns from the left-hand navigation menu.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">From the Column management page, you can customize the following options:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Columns: You can add, remove, and rename columns.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Column Layout: You can rearrange the order of columns.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Issue Status Mapping: You can map columns to issue statuses. For each column, you can have one or more issue statuses mapped to it.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Column Constraint: You can add constraints to columns, limiting how many issues can be in a status at any given time.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Let's start with creating new columns. There are two ways new columns can be created and mapped to issue statuses, depending on whether you are using an agile simplified workflow or not.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can determine whether you are using the simplified workflow by looking at the Simplified Workflow field, and seeing if it says Using Agile Simplified Workflow, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone61" src="img/00065.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">For a new column to be usable, it needs to have at least one status mapped. If you are using the agile simplified workflow, this is a very straightforward process. The agile simplified workflow takes care of this for you, so you don't have to worry about manual column status mapping. It is recommended that you use the agile simplified workflow where possible. To add a new column, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Add column button. A new column will be added to the list in the penultimate position.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Enter a name and select a category for the new column. A new issue status with the same name will also be created and mapped to the new column. Generally speaking, if the new column is going to be the first column on the board, select To Do as the category. If it is going to be the last column, select the Done category. Otherwise, select the In Progress category.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">If you are not using the agile simplified workflow, you will need to perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Create the new column as outlined in the preceding list.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Create new workflow statuses to be mapped to the new column and add the statuses used by the workflow.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Manually drag and drop the statuses into the new column, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone62" src="img/00066.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You can also map additional statuses to columns by dragging the statuses you want to map from under the Unmapped Statuses section and dropping them into the target column. Once you have mapped at least one status to the new column, it will be displayed on the board in active sprint mode.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It is recommended that you have one column per workflow status to keep the flow logical and simple. However, you can have multiple statuses mapped to one column, as shown in the preceding screenshot. As you can see, we have both the Done and Fixed statuses mapped to the Done column. You will usually find the need to do this if you are creating a Scrum board for an existing project with a workflow in place, or if you have a complex workflow that cannot be mapped to columns on the board one to one. When you map multiple statuses to a column, such as the Done column in our example, and move an issue into the column, you will be able to select the appropriate status, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone63" src="img/00067.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">When using the agile simplified workflow, you will see a checkbox option called Set resolution in the mapped workflow status. If you check this option, when an issue is moved into the corresponding column, it will be automatically assigned the resolution value of Done. Jira makes use of the resolution value to determine whether an issue is completed, so it is important to assign a value for the status/column that represents the end of the workflow.</p>
<p>If you are not using the agile simplified workflow, this option is not available; the resolution must be set using a workflow transition screen.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Setting up column layout</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Once you have created all your new columns and mapped them to workflow statuses, you can rearrange the layout by dragging and dropping the columns left and right to their desired locations, as shown in the following screenshot. The order of your column should reflect your workflow, starting from the left and moving to the right so that it visually represents the logical flow of an issue through the work process:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone64" src="img/00068.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As we will see in <a href="part0109.html#37UDA0-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre11">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre2">Jira Software – Advanced</em>, you will be able to export your issues from your board onto a physical board and import them back in, as long as the column layout of your Jira agile board is the same as your physical board.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Working with swimlanes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Swimlanes are the horizontal counterparts to the columns on a board. Unlike columns, which are always mapped to issue statuses, you can base your swimlanes on several criteria:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Queries</strong>: These are Jira search queries constructed with JQL. With this option, each swimlane will only show results from its own query. For example, you can create a query for each priority value, so you can group your issues based on their importance.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Stories</strong>: Each swimlane will be mapped to a story. All subtasks that fall under the story will be displayed in the swimlane.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Assignees</strong>: Each swimlane will be mapped based on the issue's assignee.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Epics</strong>: Each swimlane will be mapped to an epic. All issues that fall under the epic will be displayed in the swimlane.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Projects</strong>: Each swimlane will be mapped to a project. If there is only one project, there will be only one swimlane.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Using swimlanes is a great way to group and categorize your issues on your Scrum board. For example, with the Assignees option, you can easily get an idea of each team member's workload by just looking at the board.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The following screenshot shows a Scrum board with three swimlanes based on issue priority, using the queries option:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Using quick filters</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">When you have a big project team, your board can get very busy. Sometimes you want to narrow them down and focus on issues that fit specific criteria, such as bugs, or issues that are assigned to a specific user.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By using quick filters, we can remove the unnecessary <em class="calibre2">noise</em> by filtering out all the issues that do not fit the criteria, letting you focus on the issues that you care about, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone67" src="img/00071.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You can think of quick filters as additional views for your Scrum board. For example, the preceding screenshot shows four quick filters for the Scrum board: Stories Only, Bugs Only, Only My Issues, and Recently Updated. By using the Bugs Only quick filter, you can get a view of your board showing only bug issues. You can toggle a quick filter on and off by clicking on it. When turned on, it will be highlighted in blue and update the board with only issues that fit the filter's criteria. Clicking on the filter again will unapply it. You can have more than one quick filter applied to a board at the same time, and only issues that fit all the filters' criteria will be shown.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating new quick filters</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">All agile boards come with two default quick filters:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Only My Issues: This displays issues that are assigned to the currently logged-in user</li>
<li class="calibre9">Recently Updated: This displays issues that have been updated in the last 24 hours</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">If you are the board administrator, you can create new quick filters for your board to help you and your team to better visualize your issues. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Navigate to the agile board that you want to customize.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Board drop-down menu and select the Configure option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select Quick Filters from the left-hand navigation menu.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Enter a name for the filter in the Name field. The name entered here will be displayed on the agile board.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Enter the search query for the filter in the JQL field, as shown in the following screenshot.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to create the new filter.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Once created, the new quick filter will be available to everyone using the board:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone68" src="img/00072.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">In our example, as shown in the preceding screenshot, the JQL query <kbd class="calibre12">issuetype = Bug</kbd> means that issues that have the value <kbd class="calibre12">Bug</kbd> for their issue type field will be included.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Scrumban</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The first mixed agile methodology is called <strong class="calibre1">Scrumban</strong>. As you may have guessed from its name, it is a methodology based on Scrum, but with a hint of Kanban mixed in. As we have seen in <a href="part0033.html#VF2I0-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre11">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre2">Jira Software for Scrum</em>, the Scrum methodology revolves around grooming a backlog of tasks and running your project in iterations, called sprints. While this is a great way to plan and manage your project, it sometimes fall short when it comes to actually visualizing the execution of your sprints, which is something Kanban is great at. So instead of forcing you to make a choice between the two methodologies, Jira lets you use Scrum as the basis, so you can still run your project with time-boxed sprints and bring in some of the features and benefits of Kanban, and this hybrid methodology is called Scrumban.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In <a href="part0057.html#1MBG20-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre11">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre2">Jira Software for Kanban</em>, we introduced column constraints and how Jira uses that to visually show you bottlenecks in your workflow on a Kanban board. This same approach is also how Jira lets you use part of Kanban's features in Scrum. For example, we have set a constraint that there should be a minimum of three and no more than five issues in the In Progress column for our Scrum board, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00073.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Just like with Kanban, once you have placed constraints on a column, if it is violated, the column will be highlighted. As shown in the following screenshot, the In Progress column has a maximum constraint of three issues, but we have four, so it is highlighted in red. The In Review column has a minimum constraint of two issues, but we have one, so it is highlighted in yellow:</p>
<div><img src="img/00074.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Column constraints do not prevent you from violating the limits. They simply help to flag areas where there might be a problem. Setting the limits for your columns can be tricky, especially when you are just getting started. You should start with your gut feeling, run a few sprints, and refine the limits as you and your team get a better feel for the workflow. One way to get started is to base your limits on the number of people you have on your team. For example, if you have five developers, then your maximum limit for your In Progress columns (assuming this means development) should be no more than five, as it is not logical to have five people working on six issues at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, if we look at the example in the preceding screenshot, we are over the maximum limit for the In Progress column. This could mean that the team, especially the developers, has overcommitted on their tasks; someone might have decided to work on two tasks in parallel. This is causing a bottleneck, and issues are not being completed quickly enough to move to the In Review column, causing a minimum limit violation, where you have reviewers waiting around for work. This data can be very useful in your sprint retrospective meetings to help you review the problem and refine the process.</p>
<p class="calibre3">So, as you can see, setting column constraints is situational, and is based on your team's composition as well as their abilities. As things change, you will need to change your limits accordingly. Remember, the goal here is to measure, identify, and improve.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Kanplan</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The second mixed agile methodology is called <strong class="calibre1">Kanplan</strong>. As the name suggests, this methodology leans more toward Kanban than Scrum. In a nutshell, Kanplan allows you to have a more robust backlog, while still allowing you time to enjoy the flexibility of Kanban.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As we have seen in the previous chapter, by default, a Kanban board does not have a true backlog. You will usually use the first column on the board as the backlog. While this approach works when you are just getting started, very soon it will become very hard to manage as the number of items in the column grows. This makes it difficult to get a good grasp on all the outstanding issues, and also causes trouble when your team tries to prioritize things to work on, especially if they have also defined custom swimlanes for your board.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To enable backlog for a Kanban board, follow these steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Navigate to the Kanban board that you want to add a backlog for.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Board drop-down menu and select the Configure option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select the Columns option from the left-hand panel.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Drag one or more workflow statuses into the Kanban backlog section on the left:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00075.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the preceding screenshot, we have a Backlog column in our Kanban columns setup, but since we now want to use the backlog feature, we move the Backlog status to the Kanban backlog column instead.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The new Kanban backlog works just like any board columns: You can have more than one status mapped to it, so any issues in one of the mapped statuses will appear in the new backlog. Note that because of this, any issues that are not in a mapped status will not appear in the new backlog, so make sure you add all the appropriate statuses.</p>
<p>Simply mapping all your existing statuses in the default Backlog column to the new Kanban backlog would be the easiest way to ensure you do not leave any issues off.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have enabled backlog for your Kanban board, you will see the new Backlog option at the top of the left-hand navigation panel when you go to your project. Clicking on that will show you a very similar interface to Scrum, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00076.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Just like a Scrum' backlog, all issues are ordered from top to bottom. You can drag any issue up and down the backlog queue to prioritize it. For issues that are at the very bottom, you can right-click on the issue and send it straight to the top.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One key difference between a Kanban backlog and a Scrum backlog is that since Kanban does not have sprints, you do not create them and then add issues to the sprints. Instead, you add issues to the next status or column in the workflow. In the example shown in the preceding screenshot, this is the Selected for Development column. If you are familiar with Scrum, that is the section where your new sprint is, and you will be adding issues into the sprint. Here in Kanban, you are prioritizing and moving issues from the backlog's to-do list into an action list. With this change, your new Kanban board will look something similar to the one shown in the following screenshot, where the board will focus on the actual issues that have been prioritized without the noise of a big overwhelming Backlog column to distract your team with:</p>
<div><img src="img/00077.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">And this is not where the new Kanplan backlog stops. By leveraging the same backlog feature available to Scrum, you now also get access to features such as managing your issues with epics in a visual way, just like in Scrum. This is especially helpful for Scrum teams that are just starting to move toward using Kanplan. The epics panel for your backlog should be enabled by default, but if for some reason it is not, you can always manually enable it by going to the Column management page of your agile board's configuration panel:</p>

<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we looked at different ways to customize and manage your agile board in Jira. Some of the important points we have covered include managing the permissions and scopes of an agile board, customizing the board's columns, mapping board columns to Jira workflow statuses, and using swimlanes to group similar issues to better categorize our issues.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We also touched on some concepts in Jira, such as permissions and workflows. In the next chapter, we will take a deeper look into these core features of Jira, and how you can customize and manage them to suit your specific needs.</p>
