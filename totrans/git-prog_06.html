    <h1 id="_idParaDest-125" class="chapterTitle">Interactive Rebasing</h1>
    <p class="normal">Interactive rebasing is a confusing name for a very useful Git functionality. From a user's perspective, rebase and interactive rebase have little in common. </p>
    <p class="normal">Interactive rebase allows you to clean up your commits, but only <em class="italic">before</em> you push them to the server. With interactive rebasing you can:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">"Squash" your commits so that your commit history is sparser and easier to read</li>
      <li class="bullet">Modify the message for your commits</li>
      <li class="bullet">Fixup, which is just like squash except that it doesn't stop and ask for a new message</li>
      <li class="bullet">Drop, which removes a commit</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">The key thing here is that you are modifying commits, not the files that go into a commit. And, as I'll keep mentioning, you must do this interactive rebasing <em class="italic">before</em> you push your commits to origin. You never modify commits once they are on the server because other developers may be interacting with the commits, and you will likely create conflicts, which are time-consuming to repair. See <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>,<em class="italic"> Merging, Pull Requests and Handling Merge Conflicts</em>, for information on merge conflicts.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-126" class="title">Interactive rebasing at work</h1>
    <p class="normal">To see this at work, we <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>need a dozen commits. Let's create a new quick and dirty program and create commits with every line. Once we have that, we can look at how interactive rebasing is accomplished at the command line and also in Visual Studio. </p>
    <div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-"><strong class="screenText">Note</strong>: you would never commit this frequently, but we need commits to work with.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-127" class="title">Creating our example</h2>
    <p class="normal">For variety's sake, let's create the skeleton of a <a id="_idIndexMarker184"/>music tracking application. The first step is to create the repository on GitHub:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.1: Creating a repository</p>
    <p class="normal">With the repository created, we need to clone it into a local repository. This time let's use Visual Studio, and GitHub's awareness of Visual Studio. On GitHub click on <strong class="screenText">Code</strong> and when the dropdown opens, choose <strong class="screenText">Open with Visual Studio</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.2: Downloading a commit with Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">When you do, Visual Studio <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>will open and offer to save your project, with the name and default location chosen. For this exercise, create a solution with that project, and then add a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Music</code> class:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.3: Cloning a repository with Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">Click on <strong class="screenText">Clone</strong> in the lower-right corner and you will be brought to your application. You may be asked to sign in to GitHub if you haven't already done so from Visual Studio.</p>
    <p class="normal">Because the <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>checkboxes were selected at repo creation, your three files are already in the <strong class="screenText">Solution Explorer</strong> (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">README.md</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">LICENSE</code>, and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.gitignore</code>). Your next step is to create a project in that solution. In our case, we'll create a console application named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">MusicHandler</code>. Click on <strong class="screenText">File</strong> | <strong class="screenText">New Project</strong> and select <strong class="screenText">Console Application</strong>. You'll be asked what framework you'd like to use. For this console application any will do; I'll choose .NET 5. Click on <strong class="screenText">Create</strong> in the lower right-hand corner.</p>
    <p class="normal">Your application is created, complete with <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code>. Let's make this our first commit. Staying in Visual Studio, we can click on the <strong class="screenText">Git</strong> menu item, and choose <strong class="screenText">Commit or Stash</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.4: Your first commit with Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">As soon as you select it, the right-hand window (where <strong class="screenText">Solution Explorer</strong> is) will turn into a Git handler:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.5: Visual Studio's principal Git handler</p>
    <p class="normal">There is a <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>lot of information here. At the bottom of the figure, you see that the project and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code> are marked as new (capital A) and that there are two changes (which is correct). You can stage them by clicking on the <strong class="screenText">+</strong> sign. Or you can click on <strong class="screenText">Commit All </strong>to both stage and commit your files.</p>
    <p class="normal">Enter your message and select <strong class="screenText">Commit All</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.6: After creating a commit in Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">The view immediately <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>changes in a few significant ways. At the top you see that a commit was created locally – that is, in the local repository. You also see that you now have "1 outgoing" – that is, one commit locally that has not been pushed to the server.</p>
    <p class="normal">You also see an <strong class="screenText">Amend </strong>checkbox; you can use that if you want to change the message on the most recent commit. Even though we have one outgoing, we are not going to push that commit. We need a number of local commits.</p>
    <p class="normal">We need a solution to work with, so create a new project/solution in the same location. When you are done, your <strong class="screenText">Solution Explorer</strong> should look like <em class="italic">Figure 6.7</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_07.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.7: Creating a project in the repo folder</p>
    <p class="normal">We're now ready to create our <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Music</code> class:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
public class Music
{
     public Music()
     {
     }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Let's commit that. You will see that your files are not yet tracked. You'll need to add them to the index:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git add .
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Now you are ready to commit it:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git commit -m "Add music class"
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">If you <a id="_idIndexMarker189"/>look at the log, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">git log --oneline</code>, you should see all three commits: the one created when you cloned the repository and the two you created by hand:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">8147adb (HEAD -&gt; main) Add music class
238230b Initial Commit
b6fc88f (origin/main, origin/HEAD) Initial commit
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Let's create two more commits. We'll start by giving the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Music</code> class some properties, committing as we add each one:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
public class Music
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Artist { get; set; }
    public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">We can review our commits by going to the <strong class="screenText">Git </strong>menu and choosing <strong class="screenText">View Branch History </strong>(which is much like <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">git log ––oneline</code>):</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_08.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.8: Reviewing a commit in Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">The result is a <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>list of the IDs, the author of the commit, the date of the commit, and the commit message, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.9</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_09.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.9: Reviewing the history of commits in Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice that Visual Studio differentiates between those commits that are already on the server (under <strong class="screenText">Local History</strong>) and those that have not yet been pushed (under <strong class="screenText">Outgoing</strong>).</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's add just three more commits. If you followed along, then you are as stuck as I am with <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Music</code> outside of any namespace. Let's fix that:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
namespace MusicHandler
{
    public class Music

        public string Name { get; set; }
        public string Artist { get; set; }
        public DateTime ReleaseDate { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Now drag <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Music.cs</code> out of the <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>solution and into the project, and you will thus have fixed my error. This is an easy error to make when grabbing a solution from a repository using Visual Studio.</p>
    <p class="normal">Commit these changes.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now we can make an instance of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Music</code> inside <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code> and commit that:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var music = new Music();
    music.Name = "Ripple";
    music.Artist = "Grateful Dead";
    music.ReleaseDate = new DateTime(11, 1, 1970);
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">We can now use the <strong class="screenText">Git</strong> menu in Visual Studio to see the entire commit history:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.10: Returning to Visual Studio to see the entire commit history</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.11: Using the log to see the commit history</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-128" class="title">Using interactive rebase to clean up your commits</h2>
    <p class="normal">Let us suppose that we do <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>not want the three <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>commits of name, artist, and release date to appear as separate commits, cluttering up the history. This is where interactive rebase comes in. We need only to count the number of commits down to one or two past the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Add Name property</code>. Let's say we decide on <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">7</code>. We can then enter:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git rebase -i HEAD~7
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Git will respond with:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">hint: waiting for your editor to close the file…

    <p class="normal">and it will open Visual Studio Code as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.12</em>:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.12: Waiting for your editor to open</p>
    <p class="normal">Now comes the <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>fun part. For each line, we have a <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>number of options:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Leave pick, which will just keep the commit as is</li>
      <li class="bullet">Squash – the one we want, explained below</li>
      <li class="bullet">Drop – leave that commit out – erase it</li>
      <li class="bullet">Label – label chosen commit(s) with a label (see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Using the Log</em>)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">You can also re-order your commits if that is somehow helpful to you.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's do what we set out to do, squash the release, name, and artist into the commit above (create the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">music</code> class). With Visual Studio Code make the changes shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.13</em>:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.13: Inside the editor for an interactive rebase</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice we are set to squash the release date into the artist (making them one commit), then squash that commit into Name, and then take all of that and squash it into the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">music</code> class. This will make one commit out of the four.</p>
    <p class="normal">Save the file; Git comes <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>back and re-opens the file and offers to <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>allow you to fix up the messages. It starts by showing you what messages you had, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.14</em>:</p>

    <p class="normal">Interactive rebase is both powerful and safe. It can clean up your commits before pushing them, making it easier for your teammates to read the history. If you get into trouble during the interaction with interactive rebase, you can enter:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">--abort

    <p class="normal">to return to where you were before the interactive rebase started.</p>
    <p class="normal">I confess, I use <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>squash all the time, and I almost never use any of the <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>other options; though it is good to know they are there.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-129" class="title">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter you learned:</p>

    </ul>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-130" class="title">Challenge</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this challenge you will create a new project that you will clone to your local repository using GitHub Desktop. You will then add at least 7-8 commits. Finally, you'll use interactive rebase to squash some of your commits together. Feel free to experiment with some of the other options in interactive rebase.</p>
    <p class="normal">For my project I'm going to create a solution that tracks the Rocky Horror Picture Show (a true classic).</p>
    <p class="normal">Step 1, as usual, is to create the new repository:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_21.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.21: Creating the repo</p>
    <p class="normal">Step 2 is to clone to your disk; however, this time we'll use GitHub Desktop:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_22.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.22: Downloading the repository with GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">GitHub Desktop will be launched:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_23.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.23: Launching GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">GitHub Desktop will launch and pop up a modal dialog box asking you to confirm or change the repository and where you want to put it on your disk:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_24.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.24: Cloning to GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">As expected, your repository is cloned to the folder you designated, and GitHub Desktop is set to your repository and main branch:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_25.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.25: Confirming the local repository was created</p>
    <p class="normal">The next step is to create a project in that directory. GitHub Desktop is immediately populated on the left side with the files you've entered, and on the right side with the changes to the selected file:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_26.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.26: Creating a project in your repository directory</p>
    <p class="normal">We want to commit this, but not push it. We make the commit using the commit section at the bottom left:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_27.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.27: Creating a commit (with a message) in GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">GitHub Desktop reconfigures to show you the current state of your project:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_28.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.28: The state of your project, shown in GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">Following the arrows from left to right we see that there are now zero changes to report; this is reiterated in the headline and the third arrow points to the button that would push your changes to origin (which we will not do now).</p>
    <p class="normal">In the upper left-hand corner is a button that says <strong class="screenText">History</strong>; clicking that brings you to your commit history, with each file added or modified in that commit listed:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_29.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.29: Your commit history in GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">There is quite a bit to see here. The highlighted commit has an up arrow offering to push it to origin. It also has the one-line headline from the commit, which is repeated on the right where you will also find the commit message. Once again, clicking on any of the files in that commit will show the changes in the right-hand window (not shown).</p>
    <p class="normal">Now let's add commits as we have in the past. I opted to begin by creating a class called <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Showing</code>, which will have properties for the location and time of each showing of the film in Boston for a given week:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">namespace RockyHorror
{
    public class Showing
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">I'll commit after creating the class and each of its properties. When I'm done, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Showing</code> looks like this:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">namespace RockyHorror
{
    public class Showing
    {
        public string Location { get; set; }
        public int NumberOfSeats { get; set; }
        public List&lt;DateTime&gt; ShowTimes { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The first time I saved this file, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ShowTimes</code> was just a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">DateTime</code>, but I quickly realized that would require an object at each location for each showtime, so I changed it to a list of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">DateTime</code> objects.</p>
    <p class="normal"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code> ended up looking like this:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace RockyHorror
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)

            var showing = new Showing();
            showing.Location = "Brattle";
            showing.NumberOfSeats = 250;
            showing.ShowTimes = new List&lt;DateTime&gt;
            {
                new DateTime(0,0,0,10,0,0),
                new DateTime(0,0,0,13,0,0),
                new DateTime(0,0,0,16,0,0),
                new DateTime(0,0,0,19,0,0),
                new DateTime(0,0,0,22,0,0),
                new DateTime(0,0,0,0,0,1)
            };
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">The first time I committed the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ShowTimes</code> I forgot to include midnight (horrors!). Let's look at the history available in GitHub Desktop:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17741_06_30.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.30: Commit history in GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">Before we push these, let's clean them up with an interactive rebase. We can combine some commits, and more interesting, we can drop the commit with just a single time because it is replaced with the commit that makes <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ShowTimes</code> into a list.</p>
    <p class="normal">The easiest way to do so is to use the command line to bring up the editor.</p>

    <p class="normal">We are dropping the commit in which showtime was a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">DateTime</code> as it is replaced by the next commit where <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ShowTimes</code> is a list of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">DateTime</code> objects. We are also squashing all the entries into our instance into a single commit. Once we save this, we will have an opportunity to fix up the messages.</p>
    <p class="normal">Oops, we are notified there is a conflict:</p>

    <p class="normal">Git offers us a number of alternatives: fix the conflict and then continue the rebase or skip the conflicted commit and abort the rebase. Let's fix the problem by returning to GitHub Desktop:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.34: Finding the conflict in GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice that GitHub Desktop knows about the conflict too, and offers a number of choices:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Open in Visual Studio Code</li>
      <li class="bullet">Open in the command line</li>
      <li class="bullet">Open with your tool of choice</li>
      <li class="bullet">Resolve manually</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let's choose to open in Visual Studio Code:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 6.35: The conflict in Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio Code works hard to help you make the changes. Notice the small menus that allow you to accept one or the other or both changes (and it gives you the message on the incoming change to make sure you know what you are choosing). When you are done, the file looks as you intended:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
namespace RockyHorror
{
    public class Showing
    {
        public string Location { get; set; }
        public int NumberOfSeats { get; set; }
        public List&lt;DateTime&gt; ShowTimes { get; set; }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Save and close the file. When you return to the command line, add the fixed file back in and then tell Git to continue:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git add .
git rebase --continue
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio Code will open again, to allow you to fix up the commit messages. Save and close and Visual Studio Code will open a third time to allow you to fix up all your messages. Once you save and close that, much to your relief, Git will tell you that the rebase has succeeded:</p>
