			<h1 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Using Jira for Business Projects</h1>
			<p>Jira initially started as a bug-tracking system, helping software development teams track and manage the problems/issues in their projects. As the product evolved, people started using Jira for other purposes. Some use it as a general-purpose task management solution, while others use it as a customer support portal. There are also other creative uses for Jira, such as tracking financial portfolio performances.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will take a look at projects and project types while focusing on the most basic Jira project type – <strong class="bold">business</strong>. Then, we will look at the various user interfaces that Jira has for working with projects, both as an administrator and an everyday user. We will also introduce permissions in the context of projects, which we will expand upon later in this book. Since business is the most basic project type, most of the concepts covered in this chapter will apply to the more specialized types.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Understanding projects and project types</li>
				<li>Jira permissions</li>
				<li>Creating projects</li>
				<li>Project user interfaces</li>
				<li>Importing data into Jira</li>
				<li>The HR project</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Understanding projects and project types</h1>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">project</strong> is one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>most important<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> concepts when working with Jira. A project can represent anything from a department or a team in an organization to an actual software project or an IT helpdesk. One way to describe a project is that it is a collection of work<a id="_idIndexMarker116"/> items, called <strong class="bold">issues</strong>. It helps provide context when users create and work with issues. For example, a software development team will work with issues in a project that has been created for the product they are working on, while a support team will work within a helpdesk project.</p>
			<p>Project types help define the purpose of the project and provide a tailored experience and set of features to the users. For example, a service management project will have features such <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>as <strong class="bold">service-level agreements</strong> (<strong class="bold">SLAs</strong>), while a software development project will provide support for Scrum or Kanban.</p>
			<p>Each project type also comes with one or more templates, with a set of predefined configurations to help you get started quickly. The following screenshot shows the project types <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>and<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> their templates from an out-of-the-box Jira installation:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.1_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Create project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Create project</p>
			<p>The list of project types and templates will vary, depending on what features you have installed and enabled for your Jira deployment. We will look at how you can add additional project types later in this book. For now, we will focus on the <strong class="bold">Business</strong> project type since <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>it <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>is the most basic, and most of its features are shared among other project types.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-41"><a id="_idTextAnchor040"/>Business projects</h2>
			<p>As we have already<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> seen, Jira comes with several project types, depending on what features you have available. The <strong class="bold">Business</strong> project type is available out of the box and its templates mostly focus on enabling users to easily create tasks and track and report on their progress.</p>
			<p>The first three templates – <strong class="bold">Project management</strong>, <strong class="bold">Task management</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Process management</strong> – all come with predefined configurations such as workflows and fields. You can use them as is or customize them further, based on your needs. There are other types of projects, such as <strong class="bold">Service management </strong>and<strong class="bold"> Software development</strong>, though we will cover these later in this book.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Jira permissions</h1>
			<p>Before we start diving into projects, we need to understand a little bit about permissions. Permission is a big topic, and we will cover it in detail in <a href="B18644_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Securing Jira</em>. For now, we will briefly talk about permissions related to creating, browsing, and <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>administering projects.</p>
			<p>In Jira, there are several levels <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>of permission:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Global permission</strong>: Create and delete projects and administer Jira configuration</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project permission</strong>: Browse and administer individual projects</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue permission</strong>: Browse individual issues</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Users with the Jira administrator global permission will be able to create and delete projects. By default, users in the Jira administrator group have this permission, so the administrator user we created during the installation process in <a href="B18644_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Jira Data Center</em>, will be able to create new projects. We will refer to this user and any other users with this <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>permission as a <strong class="bold">Jira administrator</strong>.</p>
			<p>For any given project, users with <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>the <strong class="bold">Administer Projects</strong> permission for that project will be able to administer the project’s configuration settings, as we will see later in this chapter. This means that users with this permission will have access to the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> interface for a given project. This allows them to update the project’s details and configurations. By default, the Jira administrator will have this permission.</p>
			<p>If a user needs to browse the contents of a given project, then they must have the <strong class="bold">Browse Projects</strong> permission for that project. This means that the user will have access to the <strong class="bold">Project Browser</strong> interface for the project. By default, the Jira administrator will have<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> this permission. Now that we have covered the basics of Jira permissions, let’s look at how to create a new project in Jira.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Creating projects</h1>
			<p>The easiest way to create a <a id="_idIndexMarker128"/>new project is to select the <strong class="bold">Create project</strong> menu option from the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> drop-down menu from the top navigation bar. This will bring up the <strong class="bold">Create project</strong> dialog. Note that, as explained previously, you need to be a Jira administrator (such as the user we created during installation) to create projects. This option is only available if you have this permission.</p>
			<p>From the <strong class="bold">Create project</strong> dialog, select the template you want to use under the <strong class="bold">Business</strong> heading and click on <strong class="bold">Next</strong>. On the next page, Jira will display the predefined configurations for the template you have selected. In our example, we have selected the <strong class="bold">Project management</strong> template, so Jira provides us with two issue types and a very simple workflow with three steps. Click on the <strong class="bold">Select</strong> button to continue, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.2_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Project management – step 1&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Project management – step 1</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You can change these configurations after the project has been created.</p>
			<p>For the third and final step, we need to provide details for the new project. Jira will help you validate the details by making sure that the project key is unique and conforms to the required<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> format. After filling in the project details, click on the <strong class="bold">Submit</strong> button to create the new project, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.3_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Project management – step 2&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – Project management – step 2</p>
			<p>The following table lists the information you need to provide when creating a new project:</p>
			<div><div><table id="table001-2" class="T---Table">
						<colgroup>
							<col/>
							<col/>
						</colgroup>

								<td class="T---Table T---Body T---Body">
									<p>This is a unique identity key for the project. As you type the name of your project, Jira will auto-fill the key based on the name, though you can replace the auto-generated key with one of your own. You will be able to change the key later. The project key will also become the first part of the issue key for issues created in the project.</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.1 – Create project dialog information</p>
			<p>Once you have created the new project, you will be taken to the <strong class="bold">Project Browser</strong> interface, which we will discuss in the forthcoming sections.</p>
			<p>You may have <a id="_idIndexMarker130"/>noticed that in the <strong class="bold">Create project</strong> dialog, there are three additional options at the bottom:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Import a project</strong>: This allows you to import data from other sources, such as a CSV file, into a new or existing Jira project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create with shared configuration</strong>: This allows you to create a new project based on the configurations of an existing project. This is a great way for you to create a project based on a standard set of configurations quickly, as well as to reduce management overhead by reducing the number of different configurations.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Create sample data</strong>: This allows you to create a new project and populate it with some sample issues so that you can start exploring the various features offered by different project templates.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will cover importing data into a project in the <em class="italic">Importing data into Jira</em> section. Creating a project <a id="_idIndexMarker131"/>with sample data is a great way to test out a new project template.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Project user interfaces</h1>
			<p>There are<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> two distinctive interfaces for projects in Jira. The first interface is designed for everyday users and provides useful information on how the project uses reports, statistics, and agile boards. We will refer to this interface as the <strong class="bold">Project Browser</strong> interface.</p>
			<p>The second interface is designed for project administrators to control project configuration settings, such as permissions and workflows; we will refer to this interface as the <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> interface.</p>
			<p>After creating a project, the first interface you see will be <strong class="bold">Project Browser</strong>. We will start by looking at this interface before looking at the <strong class="bold">Project Settings</strong> interface.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Project browser</h2>
			<p>The Project<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> Browser will vary, depending on the type of project you create. For business projects, it is relatively simple. A few tabs are available from the left-hand panel:</p>
			<div><div><table id="table002" class="No-Table-Style">

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.2 – Project Browser tabs</p>
			<p>Let’s look at<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> some of these tabs in greater detail.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>The Summary tab</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> tab provides <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>you with a single-page view of the project you are working on. For business projects, it provides an activity view, which will display the latest activities that are happening in the project, and a statistics view, which provides you with several useful breakdowns of the issues within the project. For example, <strong class="bold">Unresolved: By Assignee</strong> lets you know how many open issues have been assigned to each user, allowing the project team to plan their resource allocation, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.4_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – The Summary tab&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – The Summary tab</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>The Issues tab</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> tab, by <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>default, lists all open issues in the project. It also contains several other predefined filters you can use to look for issues. From here, you can select an individual issue and get more information about it, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.5_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – The Issues tab&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.5 – The Issues tab</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-48"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>The Versions and Components tabs</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Versions</strong> and <strong class="bold">Components</strong> tabs list<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> all the available versions and components that have been configured for this project, respectively. These two views are only visible if the project contains versions and/or components. We will look at how these can be used later.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Project settings</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> interface <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>is where project <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>administrators can manage the settings and configurations of their projects. For example, you can change the project’s name and key, select what issue types will be available for the project, and manage a list of components within the project. Only users with the <strong class="bold">Administer Projects</strong> permission for a given project will be able to access this interface.</p>
			<p>To access the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> interface, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the <strong class="bold">Project Browser</strong> interface for the project you want to administer.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> option at the bottom left. If you do not see this option, then you do not have the necessary permission.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>From the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> interface, you will be able to perform the following key operations:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Update project details, such as the project’s name, description, avatar, and type</li>
				<li>Manage what users see when working on the project, such as issue types, fields, and screens</li>
				<li>Configure the workflows used by the project</li>
				<li>Control permission settings and notifications</li>
				<li>Manage the list of available components and versions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/> preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>key operations can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.6_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Project settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6 – Project settings</p>
			<p>As a project administrator, this is where you will be applying customizations to your project; you can find all the options in the left-hand panel. When you create your project, Jira will automatically create these configurations for you, depending on the template you choose. Let’s take a look at each of these options.</p>
			<h3>The Project details tab</h3>
			<p>The first group of options includes <strong class="bold">Summary</strong>, <strong class="bold">Details</strong>, <strong class="bold">Audit log</strong>, <strong class="bold">Re-index project</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Delete project</strong>. Let’s<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> take a look at them in more detail:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Summary</strong>: Displays a single-page view of all the current configuration settings for the project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Details</strong>: Allows you to change the project’s general information, including the project key, type, avatar, description, and category.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Audit log</strong>: This is a new feature in Jira Data Center that will show you a list of configuration changes that have been made to the project (note that this does not include changes made to issues). It will show you what was changed, when the change happened, and who made the change.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Re-index project</strong>: This feature re-indexes the project to update the search index for issues in this project. You should do this when configuration changes have been made to the project, such as new fields being added.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delete project</strong>: This feature deletes the project and all its issues. This operation cannot be undone.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>The Components tab</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Components</strong> tab is <a id="_idIndexMarker143"/>where project administrators can manage the components for their projects. Components can be thought of as subsections that make up the full project. In a business project, components can be various business functions or operations that need to be completed. As shown in the following screenshot, three components have been configured in the current project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.7_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – Components&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – Components</p>
			<p>Components are project-specific in Jira. This means that components from one project cannot be used in a different project. This also allows each project to maintain its own set of <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>components. A component has four pieces of information, as shown in the following table:</p>
			<div><div><table id="table003" class="No-Table-Style">
						<colgroup>
							<col/>
							<col/>
						</colgroup>
						<tbody>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Field</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Description</strong></p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Name</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p>This is the unique name of the component.</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Description</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p>The description is optional but explains what the component is for.</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Lead</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p>This is an optional field where you can select a single user as the lead for the component. For example, in a software project, this can be the main developer for the component.</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Default assignee</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p>This tells Jira when an issue is created without the assignee being selected. If the issue has a component, then Jira will auto-assign the issue to the selected default assignee.</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.3 – Component fields</p>
			<p>One of the useful features of components is the ability to assign a default assignee to each component. This means that when a user creates an issue with a component and sets the assignee as <strong class="bold">Automatic</strong>, Jira will be able to automatically assign the issue based on the component selected. This is a very useful feature for organizations where members of various teams often do not know each other. Therefore, when it comes to assigning issues at creation time, they often find it difficult to decide who to assign them to. This feature can be set up so that the lead of the component becomes the default assignee. This means that the issues that have been raised can be delegated to other members of the<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> team.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If the issue has more than one component with a default assignee, the assignee for the first component (in alphabetical order) will be used.</p>
			<h3>The Versions tab</h3>
			<p>Like the <strong class="bold">Components</strong> tab, the <strong class="bold">Versions</strong> tab allows project administrators to manage versions for<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> their projects. Versions serve as milestones for a project. In project management, versions represent points in time. While versions may seem less relevant for projects that are not product-oriented, they can still be valuable when it comes to managing and tracking the progress of issues and work.</p>
			<p>As with components, versions also have several attributes, as shown in the following table:</p>
			<div><div><table id="table004" class="No-Table-Style">
						<colgroup>
							<col/>
							<col/>
						</colgroup>
						<tbody>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Field</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Description</strong></p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Name</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p>This is the unique name of the version.</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Description</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p>The description is optional but explains what the version is for.</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Start Date</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p>This is a date indication that states when work on this version is expected to start.</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
							<tr class="No-Table-Style">
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p><strong class="bold">Release Date</strong></p>
								</td>
								<td class="No-Table-Style T---Body">
									<p>This is an optional date that will be marked as the scheduled date when the version will be released. Versions that are not released according to the release date will have their dates highlighted in red.</p>
								</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.4 – Version fields</p>
			<p>Versions are mostly used in software development projects where a software product has a release version. It is less applicable to business projects, but if there is a need to keep track of versions, such as for documents, you can use this tab to keep track of tasks that are <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>related to a specific version.</p>
			<h3>Other tabs</h3>
			<p>There are several <a id="_idIndexMarker148"/>other tabs in the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> interface. We will not explore these tabs in this chapter as they will be covered in separate chapters. We will, however, take a look at what each tab does, as shown in the following table:</p>
			<div><div><table id="table005" class="No-Table-Style">

			<p>Now that we have<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> looked at both of Jira’s user interfaces, let’s learn how to import data into Jira.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Importing data into Jira</h1>
			<p>Jira allows you<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> to import data from other sources, such as other issue tracking systems, and tells you whether the data can be exported in a supported format, such as CSV or JSON. All the importers have a wizard-driven interface that guides you through a series of steps. These steps are mostly identical but have a few differences. Generally speaking, there are four steps when it comes to importing data into Jira, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select your source data – for example, a CSV file.</li>
				<li>Select a destination project where the imported issues will go. This can be an existing project or a new project created on the fly.</li>
				<li>Map fields from the source (for example, CSV) to Jira fields.</li>
				<li>Map field values from the source to Jira field values. This is usually required for select-based fields, such as the priority field, or select list fields. For fields such as text and number fields, this is not required.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, let’s see how<a id="_idIndexMarker151"/> to import data using a CSV file.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>Importing data through CSV</h2>
			<p>Jira comes <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>with a<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> CSV importer, which lets you import data in the <strong class="bold">comma-separated value</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSV</strong>) format. This is a very useful tool as most systems can export data in <a id="_idIndexMarker154"/>this format. You can also convert an Excel spreadsheet into a CSV file with this tool.</p>
			<p>Before you can import a CSV file into Jira, you need to make sure you format your data properly. Here is a checklist of items you must verify before importing your data:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Each row must be imported as a single issue, so make sure you have all the values for the issue in a single row.</li>
				<li>Each column should map to a corresponding Jira field. This can be either a system field or a custom field.</li>
				<li>At a minimum, you will need to have values for the required fields, such as the issue summary.</li>
				<li>All date or date-time values need to be in a consistent format.</li>
				<li>If a column is to be mapped to a user field, such as assignee, make sure you have the correct username values.</li>
				<li>If a column is to be mapped to a selection-based field, such as a select list or a checkbox, make sure you check the spelling of the values.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you have formatted your CSV file, follow these steps to import it into Jira:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="bold">Import External Project</strong> option from the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> drop-down menu.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">CSV</strong> option. This will start the import wizard.</li>
				<li>Now, you need to select the CSV file that contains the data you want to import by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Choose File</strong> button.</li>
				<li>After you<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> have <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>selected the source file, you can expand the <strong class="bold">Advanced</strong> section to select the file encoding and delimiter that’s used in the CSV file. There is also the <strong class="bold">Use an existing configuration file</strong> option, which we will talk about later in this section.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button to proceed, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.8_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – CSV File import&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8 – CSV File import</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="6">Next, you need<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> to <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>select the project you want to import your data into. You can also select the <strong class="bold">Create New</strong> option to create a new project on the fly.</li>
				<li>If your CSV file contains date-related data, ensure that you enter the format that was used in the <strong class="bold">Date format</strong> field.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button to proceed, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.9_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Map projects&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9 – Map projects</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="9">Next, you need<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> to<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> map the CSV fields (columns) to the fields in Jira. Not all fields need to be mapped. If you do not want to import data from a particular column, simply do not map the CSV field to a Jira field.</li>
				<li>For fields that contain data that needs to be mapped manually, such as select list fields, you need to check the <strong class="bold">Map field value</strong> checkbox. This will let you map the CSV field value to the Jira field value so that it can be imported correctly. If you do not manually map these values, they will be copied over as is. For fields such as select lists, new options will be automatically created.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button to proceed, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>

			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.10 – Map fields</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="12">Finally, you need<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> to<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> map the CSV field value to the Jira field value. This step is only required if you checked the <strong class="bold">Map field value</strong> checkbox for a field in <em class="italic">step 10</em>:<ol><li>Enter the Jira field value for each CSV field value.</li><li>Once you have mapped the field values, click on the <strong class="bold">Begin Import</strong> button to start the actual import process, as shown in the following screenshot. Depending on <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>the<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> size of your data, this may take some time to complete:</li></ol></li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.11_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – Map values&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.11 – Map values</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="13">Once the import process completes, you will get a confirmation message telling you the number of issues that have been imported, as shown in the following screenshot. This number should match the number of records you have in the CSV file:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.12_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – Completed import process&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.12 – Completed import process</p>
			<p>On the last confirmation screen, you can click on the <strong class="bold">download a detailed log</strong> link to download the full log file containing all the information for the import process. This is particularly useful if the import was not successful.</p>
			<p>You can also click on the <strong class="bold">save the configuration</strong> link, which will generate a text file containing all the mappings you have done for this import. If you need to run a similar import in the future, you can use this import file so that you don’t need to manually remap everything again. To use this configuration file, check the <strong class="bold">Use an existing configuration file</strong> option that was shown in <em class="italic">step 4</em>.</p>
			<p>As we can<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> see, Jira’s <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>project importer makes importing data from other systems straightforward. In the next section, we will learn how to archive old projects to help improve performance in Jira.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>Archiving projects and issues</h1>
			<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker167"/> continue<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> to use Jira, users will notice Jira’s performance starting to degrade over time. Some more noticeable examples include loading the Jira dashboard and searching for issues. Data size is indeed a major factor when it comes to Jira’s performance – the more projects, issues, and related configurations (such as custom fields) that you have, the more data Jira will need to process, and the slower it will be for your end users. The practice of archiving old and unused projects is often the solution to this problem.</p>
			<p>Before Jira Data Center, archiving a project would require you to either export and then delete the project completely, or hide the project and its issues by removing permissions from users. Both approaches are convoluted and can be error-prone.</p>
			<p>With Jira Data Center, there is now a built-in archive feature that makes the process simple and reliable. To archive a project, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Log into Jira with an administrator account.</li>
				<li>Browse to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Projects</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Archive</strong> option<a id="_idIndexMarker169"/> for the project you wish to archive, as<a id="_idIndexMarker170"/> shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.13_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13 – Archiving a project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.13 – Archiving a project</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="4">Confirm that you want to archive the project when prompted:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.14_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.14 – Archive project – confirmation&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.14 – Archive project – confirmation</p>
			<p>Once a project has been archived, it will no longer be listed for end users. Issues from the archived project will not show up in any searches. However, if you have a direct link to the issue, it can still be accessed, though you cannot make any changes to it. By archiving a project, all data related to the project, such as issues, will be removed from Jira’s search index. This will keep the index size low and improve the overall performance.</p>
			<p>If you need to restore an archived project, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> | <strong class="bold">Archived projects</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Restore</strong> option for the project you wish to restore.</li>
				<li>Go to the restored project and click on the <strong class="bold">Start project re-index</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Since an archived project will have its data removed from Jira’s search index, you will need to re-index the project before its issues will be displayed in the search results.</p>
			<p>It is worth noting that one difference between archiving a project and deleting a project is that when <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>you <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>archive a project, any configurations related to the project are still considered to be in use, so you cannot delete them. This is because Jira needs to make sure that when you unarchive the project, all the configurations are still available.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>The HR project</h1>
			<p>Now that we have <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>seen all the key aspects that make up a project, let’s revisit what you have learned so far and put it into practice. In this exercise, we will set up a project for our <strong class="bold">human resources</strong> (<strong class="bold">HR</strong>) team to help them track and manage employees joining and leaving the company, as well as tasks related to the recruitment process.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Creating a new project</h2>
			<p>First, we will start by <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>creating a new project for the HR team. To create the project, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Bring up the <strong class="bold">Create project</strong> dialog by selecting the <strong class="bold">Create project</strong> option from the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> drop-down menu.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Task management</strong> project template. We can use other templates in the <strong class="bold">Business</strong> project type, but the <strong class="bold">Task management</strong> template is the simplest option and will make future customization easier.</li>
				<li>Name our new project <code>Human Resource</code> and accept the other default values for <strong class="bold">Key</strong> and <strong class="bold">Project Lead</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Submit</strong> button to create the new project.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>At this point, you<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> will be taken to the <strong class="bold">Project Browser</strong> interface for the new project.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Creating new components</h2>
			<p>Now that our <a id="_idIndexMarker176"/>new project is in place, we need to create a few components. These components will serve as groupings for our tasks. We need to perform the following steps to create our new components:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> option in the bottom-left corner.</li>
				<li>From the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> interface, select the <strong class="bold">Components</strong> tab.</li>
				<li>Enter <code>Employee Onboarding</code> for the new component’s name.</li>
				<li>Provide a short description of the new component.</li>
				<li>Select a user to be the leader of the component.</li>
				<li>Click on <strong class="bold">Add</strong> to create the new component.</li>
				<li>Add a few more components.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>With projects created with the <strong class="bold">Business</strong> project type, components are not displayed by default, so we will have to manually add the <strong class="bold">Components</strong> field to the appropriate screens. We will cover fields and screens in <em class="italic">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Field Management</em>, and <a href="B18644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Screen Management</em>, respectively. For now, follow these steps to get our components to display when we create, edit, and view tasks:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">From the <strong class="bold">Project Administration</strong> interface, select the <strong class="bold">Screens</strong> tab. There should be three screens, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.15_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.15 – Project screens&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.15 – Project screens</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">Click <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>on <strong class="bold">HR: Task Management Create Issue Screen</strong>. This will open the <strong class="bold">Configure Screen</strong> page, with a list of fields that are currently on the selected screen.</li>
				<li>Enter and select <strong class="bold">Component/s</strong> in the select field at the bottom of the page; this will add the <strong class="bold">Components</strong> field to the screen.</li>
				<li>Repeat <em class="italic">steps 2</em> and <em class="italic">3</em> for <strong class="bold">HR: Task Management Edit/View Issue Screen</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Putting it all together</h2>
			<p>Now that you have<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> fully prepared your project, let’s see how everything comes together by creating an issue, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button from the top navigation bar. This will bring up the <strong class="bold">Create Issue</strong> dialog box.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Human Resource</strong> for <strong class="bold">Project</strong> and <strong class="bold">Task</strong> for <strong class="bold">Issue Type</strong>.</li>
				<li>Fill in the fields with some dummy data. Note that the <strong class="bold">Component/s</strong> field should display the components we just created.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button to create the issue.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If everything has been done correctly, you should see a dialog box similar to the following, where you can choose your new project to create the issue in, as well as the new components<a id="_idIndexMarker179"/> that can be selected:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.16_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 2.16 – Create Issue&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.16 – Create Issue</p>
			<p>You can test out the default assignee feature by leaving the <strong class="bold">Assignee</strong> field set to <strong class="bold">Automatic</strong> and selecting a component; Jira will automatically assign the issue to the default assignee that’s been defined for the component. If everything goes well, the issue will be<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> created in the new project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at one of the most important concepts in Jira – projects – and how to create and manage them. Permissions were introduced, and we looked at three permissions that are related to creating, browsing, and administering projects. We also looked at the very useful project archiving feature introduced in Jira Data Center, and how you can use it to help improve Jira performance by archiving unused projects.</p>
			<p>We were also introduced to the two interfaces Jira provides for project administrators and everyday users – the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> interface and the <strong class="bold">Project Browser</strong> interface, respectively. In the next chapter, we will learn how to create projects using the <strong class="bold">Software</strong> project type to enable Scrum and Kanban to run agile projects.</p>
