    on Confluence will be activated. After you create a space, you don’t want this
    space to stand up with inappropriate access settings. Although you can change
    these settings after you create the space, this has many disadvantages in practice.
    For example, during a busy period, you can forget to adjust the security settings.
    For this reason, unauthorized people may access the space or take some erroneous
    actions. If you are deleting, modifying, or exporting content, manually updating
    these settings will be a waste of time. During this process, users may experience
    access problems. That’s why we set the default settings once, and then we usually
    never touch them. You can review the **Default Space Permissions** interface in
