    to provide a solid foundation for making the most out of Jira Align. We will explore
    how Jira Align facilitates onboarding by enabling alignment and continuous learning.
    We will then learn how to create and refine a backlog. This involves creating,
    linking, importing and exporting, ranking, estimating, deleting, and searching
    for work items. Lastly, we will discuss team collaboration and keeping everyone
    informed through notifications and alerts in Jira Align.

    is aligning teams on practices and ways of working. A best practice for handling
    this is to train everyone on the team of teams together just before launching
    a program. Mapping your practices and ways of working to your tools and the modules
    within them can be another challenge. Jira Align solves this by offering a number
    of ways to get new users up and running in the platform as quickly as possible.

    Align, that theme and epic information can be gathered and put into spreadsheets
    for import into Jira Align. This will allow for full linkage between strategy

    designed to achieve a set of goals or objectives. Below that comes themes, the
    highest-level work item in Jira Align, which link up to strategic goals. A theme
    is a long-term set of epics that connects a portfolio to an enterprise strategy.
    Each portfolio epic is a funded effort that spans several business quarters and
    requires new development to realize business benefits contributing to the theme
    to which it is linked in Jira Align.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Portfolio epics are comprised of either capabilities or features. A capability
    is an optional work item level representing a collection of features supporting
    the portfolio epic to which it is linked in Jira Align. Capabilities are typically
    sized to be delivered within a business quarter and are complex enough to require
    the coordinated effort of multiple programs. A feature is a service fulfilling
    a stakeholder need, supporting either the capability or portfolio epic to which
    it is linked, and sized to be delivered in one business quarter by a single program.

    by clicking on the **Why?** button in the details panel. Thus, at a glance, any
    team member can see how their efforts are valuable to the mission of their company.
    For example, clicking the **Why?** button on a story shows information for its

- en: Ranking work items
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A well-refined backlog will be ordered by rank so that the team knows what to
    work on next. Note that while team-level backlogs of stories will be maintained
    in Jira, it's common practice for program, solution, and portfolio backlogs to
    be maintained in Jira Align, which is generally deemed to be the system of record
    for features, capabilities, and portfolio epics.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Jira Align provides two methods of ranking: manual and automated. The simplest
    way is to manually drag and drop the work item to a higher or lower position in
    the backlog list, which is in ranked order. You could also right-click on the
    work item and move it to the top, bottom, or a specified position in the backlog.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Automated ranking allows you to pull rank based on the ranking of higher-level
    work items. For example, if the portfolio team has ranked epics and you'd like
    to rank your features according to the rank of their parent epics, you can go
    to **Program** | **Backlog**, click on the **Pull Rank** button, and select **Use
    Epic**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While manual and automated ranking are simple to do, there are a couple of important
    things to keep in mind. The first is that work items are always ranked relative
    to other work items of the same type. The second is that work items actually have
    several independent ranks based on how your configuration bar is set.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Global rank is the default ranking when the configuration bar is clear, meaning
    no specific portfolio, program, or PI is selected. If a PI is selected in the
    configuration bar, you will be viewing the rank for that particular PI. If a portfolio
    or program is selected, you will see the rank within that particular portfolio
    or program. If you select a portfolio and PI or program and PI, you will be viewing
    the rank within that portfolio or program for that specific PI. The lowest level
    is selecting a team and a sprint, for which you will see the ranking of items
    worked on by that team in a particular sprint.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is another nuance regarding ranking. Earlier we noted that clicking on
    the pointing arrow symbol at the left of any row in a backlog list will expand
    the work item to show its children. Assuming there are several children, they
    can be dragged up and down under the parent to represent a sequence or rank; however,
    this is independent from the rank of those items when listed with all others of
    the same type. In other words, you can change the order in which features appear
    under a parent epic when its row is expanded, but that won't affect, for example,
    the program feature ranking you will see when you view the feature backlog and
    have a program selected in the configuration bar. This is where visibility of
    all work and rankings within the platform can drive discussions, for example,
    between epic owners and product managers, who must collaborate to ensure that
    their independent rankings of epics and features are aligned.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, we will note that Jira Align allows you to manually synchronize feature
    and story rankings between Jira Align and Jira. This option is only available
    in the feature and story backlogs when a program is selected in the configuration
    bar and no PI are selected. Note that the Jira Align administrator must enable
    this option in **Administration** | **Connectors** | **Jira Settings** | **Jira
    Setup**. Here, the administrator must enter the Jira rank field ID under **Custom
    Fields** and set **Enable Rank Sync** to **Yes** under settings. Once these settings
    are made, you will have two additional options when you click on the **Pull Rank**
    button in the backlog, one to pull rank from Jira, and the other to push rank
    to Jira.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tips and tricks
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If, after pulling rank from Jira for your features, you'd like to apply that
    ranking to a particular PI, first add the PI to your configuration bar so that
    your program and PI are selected. Then use the **Pull Rank** button again, this
    time selecting **Use Program rank to sort Features**.
  prefs: []

- en: Estimating work items
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another facet of a refined backlog is that it's estimated. Estimates at all
    levels enable learning and predictability. For example, as a scrum team learns
    its average velocity (story points completed per sprint), it can estimate how
    many sprints it will take to complete a feature based on an initial point estimate
    for the feature. Later, when that feature is broken down into stories that are
    sized, the aggregate story points can be compared with the initial estimate for
    learning purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While team-level story point estimates are typically done in Jira, Jira Align
    provides three options for how to size features, capabilities, and epics. They
    are, in order of popularity, t-shirt size, points, and team/member weeks. The
    last option may be useful in a bimodal environment where some portfolios are using
    waterfall development. The Jira Align administrator sets the estimation option
    for each portfolio in **Administration** | **Settings** | **Platform** | **Portfolio**
    | **Portfolio Specific Configuration**. This allows each portfolio to have its
    own estimation approach, which will be uniform throughout the portfolio, including
    its programs and teams.
