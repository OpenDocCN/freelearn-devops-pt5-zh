- en: In this section, we introduce the reader to the technologies, skills, and steps
    involved in developing applications using Docker Containers. We begin by tracing
    the history of hosting and why we need Docker in the first place. We then demonstrate
    the differences between virtualization and containerization, using VirtualBox
    to create simple virtual machines and using Docker to create a simple PHP application
    with state. We discuss how applications involving multiple containers working
    together (microservices) are the ultimate way to use containers, and present a
    simple CRUD demo involving several containers, including some prepared by third
    parties and shared with us on Docker Hub. Finally, we present the Docker Compose
    tool as a means to orchestrate complete applications made up of multiple containers,
    while providing private access between the containers.
