                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Exploring the User and Repository Settings</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we will explore the most important settings for both a user and a repository. There are many things you can do to personalize your experience in GitHub and many settings you can change in order to follow a specific workflow with your fellow teammates.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As a user, there is a lot of information you can set up on your user settings page, such as associating more than one email with your account, adding multiple SSH keys, and setting up two-factor authentication.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Similarly, some functionalities of a repository can be set up via its settings page. For example, you can enable or disable the wiki pages, or completely disable the issue tracker.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter we will cover the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">User settings</li>
<li class="calibre12">Repository settings</li>
<li class="calibre12">Tips and tricks</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">User settings</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">You can visit your user's settings page by navigating through the web interface (under your avatar's drop-down list) or by visiting <a href="https://github.com/settings/profile" class="calibre10">https://github.com/settings/profile</a> directly:</p>
<div><img src="img/00164.jpeg" class="calibre173"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">For example, here is what my settings landing page looks like:</p>
<div><img src="img/00165.jpeg" class="calibre174"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">We are going to analyze the most important settings GitHub provides.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Profile</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Under Personal settings, you can see various options that you can customize to your liking.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The Profile settings is where you can fill in your personal information so that people know who you are. Consider it like socialization. After all, GitHub is the Facebook of geeks.</p>
<p class="calibre3">All the profile information is optional to fill in. You can see what this will look like by visiting your username page at <kbd class="calibre13">https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;</kbd>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Setting up multiple emails</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Every commit is associated with an email address and GitHub uses the email address you set in your local Git configuration to associate commits with your GitHub account. There is no limit to the emails that you can add to your account, but you can have only one primary address. This is where GitHub will send you any notifications and it is this address that will be used when editing and committing files via the web interface.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can add or remove emails and change the primary address by visiting <a href="https://github.com/settings/emails" class="calibre10">https://github.com/settings/emails</a>. In this area, you can also choose whether or not your primary email will be shown to the public. If you decide to keep your email address private, GitHub will assign an email based on your username: <kbd class="calibre13">&lt;username&gt;@users.noreply.github.com</kbd>, which will be used whenever you edit files via your browser.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the following screenshot, you can see what that page looks like when you have multiple emails:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter" src="img/00166.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Managing your SSH keys</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">GitHub provides two ways to authenticate a user when using Git. You can use Git over HTTP or Git over SSH. For a detailed explanation of the Git protocols, visit <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html" class="calibre10">https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When using Git over HTTP, you must provide your username and password each time you make a change, unless you cache your GitHub password in Git. For more details, see the article at <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/" class="calibre10">https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The preferred and more secure way is to use Git over SSH. The concept is that you create a personal unique SSH key pair whose public key you upload to your GitHub profile. You can repeat this process as many times as you wish since GitHub allows you to have multiple SSH keys associated with your account. This way, you can have one key to use with your laptop and a different one with your desktop or your server.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">In order to use Git over SSH, the remote URL of the repository must look like <kbd class="calibre23">git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git</kbd>.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">Under your Settings tab, there is the SSH keys option. Either navigate through the GitHub UI or go directly to <a href="https://github.com/settings/keys" class="calibre10">https://github.com/settings/keys</a>. When you add an SSH public key, you must give it a Title so that you can remember where this key came from. At the Key area, you paste the contents of the public key. As you can see, GitHub also provides some useful information such as the fingerprint of the key, when it was added, and when it was last used:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter1" src="img/00167.jpeg"/></div>
<div><p class="calibre19">You cannot edit a key. If you want to set a different title, you will have to delete the old key and add it back again.</p>
</div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Setting up two-factor authentication</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Setting up two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security for your account. Using only the password to sign in can prove susceptible to security threats, since the attacker only needs a single piece of information.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This is done by having an extra authentication code generated onto your cell phone or tablet. In the case of a smartphone, you must install an application that can handle the <strong class="calibre5">Time-based One-Time Password</strong> (<strong class="calibre5">TOTP</strong>) technology. If you are looking for an open source application, check <a href="https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP" class="calibre10">https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP</a> .</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">For a list of supported applications, you can read Wikipedia's article at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_Onetime_Password_Algorithm#Client_implementations" class="calibre25">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_Onetime_Password_Algorithm#Client_implementations</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">If you do not own a smartphone, GitHub can also send the authentication code with an SMS. Since this involves delivery rates, there is a finite list of supported countries. See if yours is included here: <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/countries-where-sms-authentication-is-supported/#supported-countries-for-sms-authentication" class="calibre10">https://help.github.com/articles/countries-where-sms-authentication-is-supported/#supported-countries-for-sms-authentication</a>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) under the Security page. Visit <a href="https://github.com/settings/security" class="calibre10">https://github.com/settings/security</a> directly and press the Set up two-factor authentication button to start setting up 2FA. Pick either one of the methods and follow the on-screen instructions.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After setting up 2FA, if you visit the security page, under your settings, you will see that 2FA is enabled:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter2" src="img/00168.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">On the Security page, make sure to click the link Save your recovery codes and follow the on-screen instructions to download and save the recovery codes in a secure place. There are 16 codes that will help you gain access to your account if, for some reason, you lose your cell phone or it gets stolen. Every recovery code can only be used once and you can generate a new batch by clicking on Generate new recovery codes. Keep them safe; preferably, store them encrypted in an application such as KeepassX.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now, every time you try to log in to GitHub from a browser for the first time, apart from the usual credentials like username and password, you will be prompted to give the authorization code generated from the application of your smartphone or one of the 16 recovery codes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Repository settings</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">There are quite a few settings one can fiddle with at the repository level. To access these settings, search for the wrench icon:</p>
<div><img src="img/00169.jpeg" class="calibre175"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Changing the default branch that appears in a repository's main page</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The default branch of a repository's main page is <strong class="calibre5">master</strong>. However, there are times when you want a different branch to be your default, based on one's workflow, as we saw in <a target="_blank" href="part0098.html#2TEN40-184576c1044a4350bd24f18b869c0732" class="calibre10">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre14">Collaboration Using the GitHub Workflow</em><em class="calibre14">.</em></p>
<p class="calibre3">Let's just say, for example, that the master branch is where you push code that is considered stable and well-tested, whereas you have a different branch named develop that is used for daily pushes and testing new features. Based on this assumption, the develop branch gets updated more often than the master branch. Practically, you'd want your project to seem active; having a branch that gets updated every day in the front page is much more appealing.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this case, you can go to the repository's <strong class="calibre5">Settings</strong> &gt; <strong class="calibre5">Branches</strong> page and choose the branch you would like to have as the default from the drop-down list:</p>
<div><img src="img/00170.jpeg" class="calibre176"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Once selected, click Update and accept what GitHub tells you.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">When someone clones the repository for the first time, Git checks out the default branch that is set through the project's settings.</p>
</div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Enabling/disabling the wiki</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In <a target="_blank" href="part0044.html#19UOO0-184576c1044a4350bd24f18b869c0732" class="calibre10">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre14">Using the Wiki and Managing Code Versioning</em>, we explained in depth why the wiki is a strong asset for a project. There are, however, cases where one does not need a wiki; for example, you might use an external one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">GitHub provides you with three options regarding the visibility of a wiki:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">Enable the wiki and make it public so that everyone has write access (default)</li>
<li class="calibre12">Enable the wiki, but only owners and collaborators have write access (<strong class="calibre1">Restrict editing to collaborators only</strong>)</li>
<li class="calibre12">Disable the wiki altogether</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">The first behavior is the default one. You can find these settings in Settings &gt; Options under the Features block.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Enabling/disabling the issue tracker</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Although GitHub's issue tracker is a powerful tool for collaboration and bug reporting, there will be times when you would like to use a different tracker such as Redmine, Jira, or Bugzilla.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In this case, GitHub's issue tracker can be disabled so that you don't have many places to track and lose control. This can be achieved in Settings &gt; Options under the Features block.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">Any created issues are retained, even after you disable the Issues feature. Get the tick back and your issue tracker will be the same as before.</p>
</div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Adding collaborators</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">By adding a collaborator, you are granting push access to the repository. A repository can have many collaborators; there is no limit.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Visit the Collaborators tab under settings. Start typing the name of the user and the autocompletion is smart enough to present you with the user you are searching for:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter3" src="img/00171.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Transferring ownership – user to organization</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Every repository is created under a namespace, be it a user or an organization. In the rare case where you would like to transfer a repository to another user, this can be done in the repository settings. Since this action is considered dangerous, you will find this setting inside a red code block, signifying the importance of the task.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Basically, there are four types of transfer:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">User to user</li>
<li class="calibre12">User to organization</li>
<li class="calibre12">Organization to user</li>
<li class="calibre12">Organization to organization</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">In order to initialize the transfer, you have to provide the name of the repository and the username/organization of the new owner to confirm:</p>
<div><img class="aligncenter4" src="img/00172.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After you hit I understand, transfer this repository, an email will be sent to the new owner(s) for confirmation. After they confirm, the procedure will be completed.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Deleting a repository</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">You can delete a repository along with all its settings by pressing the Delete this repository button under Danger Zone. Bear in mind that this is a destructive action that will purge your repository, the issue tracker, any pull requests, the wiki, and in general, everything related to it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After pressing the holocaust button, you will be presented with a modal asking for confirmation. For security reasons, you must provide the repository's name to confirm. In the following screenshot, you can see that unless you provide the right name, the button for deletion will be inactive:</p>
<div><img src="img/00173.jpeg" class="calibre177"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Tips and tricks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Did you know that you can use different email addresses depending on the organization you are member of? Are you aware of how much disk space your repository takes? If no, read the following section, and learn how to perform these actions.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Finding the size of your repositories</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you are curious to know how big your repositories have become, you can visit <a href="https://github.com/settings/repositories" class="calibre10">https://github.com/settings/repositories</a> and see it for yourself. Remember that GitHub also counts the size of the <kbd class="calibre13">.git</kbd> directory, so if you have thousands of commits, the repository's size will be greater than its actual size (by actual size, I mean whatever files you see on GitHub).</p>
<p class="calibre3">For example, the <kbd class="calibre13">diaspora</kbd> repository at the time of writing this book seems to be 102 MB:</p>
<div><img src="img/00174.jpeg" class="calibre178"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">If I were to remove the <kbd class="calibre13">.git</kbd> directory, the size would be much smaller. Let's test it by using the following commands:</p>
<pre class="calibre18"><strong class="calibre1">git clone https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora
du -sh diaspora
rm -rf diaspora/.git
du -sh diaspora</strong></pre>
<p class="calibre3">Removing the <kbd class="calibre13">.git</kbd> directory gets the size down to almost 14 MB!</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Fine-tuning email notifications</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you are a member of many organizations, you may want to use a different email for notifications concerning the repository that a specific organization owns. You can achieve this by going to <a href="https://github.com/settings/notifications" class="calibre10">https://github.com/settings/notifications</a>; under Custom routes, choose the email you want to receive the notifications.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">By finishing this chapter, you should be ready to fill in the details to build a public profile that is viewable by anyone interested in knowing more about you. Your account is yours and yours only, so it should be secured as much as possible. By now, you should have followed the steps to secure it with 2FA and be a little bit safer.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You have also learned how to configure a repository's settings regarding its default branch and enabling or disabling features such as the issue tracker and the wiki. Another thing to remember is how to add collaborators to your project and how to transfer its ownership if needed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">These were the most important settings to consider, both user and project-related, and you should feel a little bit wiser towards the end.</p>
