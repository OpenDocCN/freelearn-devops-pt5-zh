- en: The information technology sector is a fast-moving sector that always tries
    to accelerate. To keep up with this, companies need to be able to move quickly
    and iterate frequently. Until a few years back, this was mainly true for software,
    but now we start to see the necessity to change infrastructures at similar speed.
    Going forward, we will need to change the infrastructure we run our software on
    at the speed of the software itself.

- en: In this scenario, many technologies, such as software-defined everything (storage,
    network, compute, what have you), will be key, but those technologies need to
    be managed in an equally scalable way, and that way will be using Ansible and
    similar products.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Ansible is highly relevant today since, differently from competing products,
    it is agentless, allowing faster deployments, more security, and better auditability.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is written to work with all Linux distributions. Since it’s not practical
    to always give the same information for all possible distributions, the example
    commands are for Fedora on the controller machine and CentOS on the controlled
    machines, if not stated. Experienced users with other distributions will have
    no problem in translating the commands for their own preferred distribution.
