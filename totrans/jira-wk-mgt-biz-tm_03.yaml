- en: Over my years of working as a Jira administrator and Atlassian community leader,
    I have seen countless requests for and questions about creating projects based
    on **templates**. As you can imagine, there are many different mindsets as to
    what a *template* looks like for a project. Some want to create a custom template
    that satisfies the particular need they have, while others just want something
    quick and easy they can click on that will build the basic project objects needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Regardless of the motivation or exact need, the general concept that the user
    is looking for is a fast way to create a project that already has built-in schemes
    and objects—such as a board or list/queue—that mostly aligns with their basic
    requirement.

    Management**, or **JWM**), **Jira Software** (**JSW**), and Jira Service Desk
    (now **Jira Service Management**, or **JSM**)—have provided a single unique set
    of objects automatically created based on the tool used to create a project.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Although the user still cannot create their own custom *template*, it was—and
    still is— possible to create a project based on an existing project that will
    provide a commonly shared set of schemes and objects. We will explore the details
    of that in [*Chapter 9*](B17952_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145), *Duplicating

    templates (more than 20!) that allow the user to create a project based on a variety
    of functions, including major groups for the templates. This chapter will also
    explore the differences in each of the available templates and the underlying
    components, such as the workflow and board columns.

    creating several technical components necessary to administer and use the project.
    We have already described in [*Chapter 1*](B17952_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013),
    *Why Choose Jira Work Management?,* how the process of creating a new project
    has the user pass through a phase of selecting a template to use. This is a necessary
    step as it establishes the workflow for cards on the project as well as columns
    that will appear on the board.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The steps in the workflow directly correlate to statuses for the project. Some
    common steps/statuses are **TO DO**, **IN PROGRESS**, **DONE**, and so on. Column
    names on the board will be the same as the status names. See the section entitled
    *How to read a workflow* later in this chapter for more on relationships between
    statuses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Along with the board and workflow, other schemes will be automatically attached
    to the project for screens, permissions, and notifications. We will discuss how
    to administer and work with those objects in more detail in [*Chapter 4*](B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062),
    *Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes*. Most of the project templates
    can be grouped or associated together along common themes or functions. We will
    explore that next.

    current JWM templates at the time of writing this book. As Atlassian has gone
    to a concerted effort to create, configure and detail the templates, it is a good
    idea to let the tool speak for itself for those descriptions. Keep in mind that
    the current templates available in the product might be somewhat different in

    components for JWM.

- en: Historically, it is the board that provides the most vivid visualization of
    the work being done on a project or by a team. Whether it be a Kanban or a Sprint
    board, it is undeniably powerful to see the cards and their progress on the board.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Simply put, boards are made up of horizontal rows called *swimlanes* and vertical
    columns that represent the activities performed on the project, such as design,
    development, or testing. In JWM projects, these columns will be a one-to-one match
    with the statuses in the project workflow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Currently, JWM projects do not allow multiple workflows to be associated with
    a board. Therefore, while there might be multiple issue types associated with
    the project, all issue types must be associated with one and only one workflow.
    We will go into more depth about configuring and modifying components in [*Chapter
    4*](B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062), *Modifying the Board, Workflow, and
    Associated Schemes*.

- en: How to read a workflow
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we will be showing many details about each template, including workflow images,
    this seems like a good time to discuss how to read a workflow. At a quick glance,
    we see that workflows are made up of **statuses** (think steps) and **transitions**
    (think paths). The workflows that follow help guide the user by providing named
    transitions from one status to the next. See *Figure 2.1* and *Figure 2.2* as
    visual references to our discussion here.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Statuses appear as different colored boxes, while transitions are lines connecting
    the statuses or identifying the path from one status to another. *Figure 2.1*
    and *Figure 2.2* have the names of the transitions turned on so that it is easier
    to tell the direction of the flow as well as describe the action taking place.
    It is always good to name transitions using a verb when possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The workflow begins with a gray circle and a **Create** transition. Note that
    cards might flow in either direction. The placement of the words on the transition
    denotes the direction of the flow—so, in this example, when an issue is created,
    it will land in the **TO DO** status. From there, the issue can only move forward
    to the **IN PROGRESS** status using a **Start Progress** transition.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Once an issue is in progress, it can either travel forward to the **DONE** status
    using a **Done** transition or return to the **TO DO** status via a **Stop Progress**
    transition. Finally, from the **DONE** status, an issue might be reopened and
    return to the **TO DO** status for a **Reopen** transition, or it might return
    to the **IN PROGRESS** status by using a **Reopen and start progress** transition.

    categories—**TO DO** (the box under the **Create** transition heading), **IN PROGRESS**

    the status names also match with the status category names:'

    in the *Issue types, workflow, and board relationships* section, only a single
    workflow will be available for all issue types in the project. Remember that the
    statuses in the workflow will relate to the columns that are displayed on the
    board.
