The best thing about JIRA is its customizations. Out of the box, JIRA can be used for bug tracking, agile-based projects, or just simple issue tracking but every organization has its own processes and different software models. In this chapter, we will discuss a specific use case of test management that will cover most of the aspects of JIRA customizations. We will start by gathering all the requirements. Then, we will implement those customizations in our JIRA instance. You will learn how to create new issue types to store test campaigns and test cases. Workflow customizations will also be discussed in detail. We will also modify the permission scheme to limit the project visibility. Learning these customizations will help you to understand the capabilities of JIRA, which can be applied to a wide range of use cases.</p><p>The topics covered are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What is test management?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating issue types for test campaigns and test cases</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Customizing the workflow for changes in transitions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Capturing additional data from users on state transitions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learning how to make certain fields mandatory only for test campaigns</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Limiting the project visibility to certain groups and individuals</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Learning how to hide a specific issue from the user within a project</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Versions and components</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec31"/>What is test management?</h1></div></div></div><p>Test management is the software process of performing tests to verify the requirements. It can be either automated or manually tested as defined in the test cases. Test campaigns are a collection of test cases. A test campaign can be created to collect all the test cases of a particular module in your project. Using JIRA, it's possible to perform manual testing; to store test campaigns, we will create a new standard issue type. On the other hand, a new subtask issue type will be created to store test cases.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec32"/>Creating issue types for test campaigns and test cases</h1></div></div></div><p>Out of the box, the JIRA software comes with a few standard <strong>Issue types</strong>, namely <strong>Bug</strong>, <strong>Epic</strong>, <strong>Story</strong>, and <strong>Task</strong>, and one subtask named <strong>Sub-task</strong>. We need to create two issue types:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Requirement</strong>: Issue types</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Test campaign</strong>: This will be the standard issue type</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Test case</strong>: This will be the subtask</li></ul></div><p>Let's take a look at how to create these issue types:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Issues</strong> | <strong>Issue types</strong> and click on the <strong>Add Issue Type</strong> button in the top-right corner:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_001.jpg" alt="Creating issue types for test campaigns and test cases"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, enter <strong>Name</strong> as <code class="literal">Test Campaign</code>, enter <strong>Description</strong> as <code class="literal">This issue type will be used as a collection of individual test cases.</code>, which is a good practice, and select <strong>Standard Issue Type </strong>as the<strong> Type</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_002.jpg" alt="Creating issue types for test campaigns and test cases"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Perform the same procedure to create a test case subtask. The only exception here is to select <strong>Sub-Task Issue Type </strong>as the<strong> Type</strong>.</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec38"/>Creating new issue type schemes</h2></div></div></div><p>Issue type schemes define which issue types will be available to a particular project. Out of the box, JIRA comes with the <strong>Default Issue Type Scheme</strong>. By default, all the newly created issue types will be added to this scheme; the two new issue types that we just created will also be added to this scheme, making them available for all the projects using it. However, as a good practice, you should always create a new issue type scheme to contain only those issues that are relevant and required. These schemes can then be reused in all other projects with similar requirements.</p><p>Let's create a new issue type scheme with the following issue types:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Bug</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Task</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Test campaign</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Test case</li></ul></div><p>To create a new issue type scheme, perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Issues</strong> | <strong>Issue type schemes</strong> and click on the <strong>Add Issue Type Scheme</strong> button in the top-right corner:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_003.jpg" alt="Creating new issue type schemes"/></div><p>
</p><p>On the <strong>Add Issue Type Scheme</strong> screen, perform the following steps to create a new issue type scheme:</p></li><li class="listitem">Enter <strong>Scheme Name</strong> as <code class="literal">Test Management Issue Type Scheme</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Add a useful <strong>Description</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Drag the required issue types from the <strong>Available Issue Types</strong> column on the right-hand side to the <strong>Issue Types for Current Scheme</strong> column on the left-hand side.</li><li class="listitem">Select <strong>Test Campaign </strong>as the<strong> Default Issue Type</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">It should look like the following screenshot. Click on the <strong>Save</strong> button to finish:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_004.jpg" alt="Creating new issue type schemes"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>The new <strong>Issue type scheme</strong> will be created and shown in the list. As you can see in the next screenshot, currently there are no projects using this scheme. Hence, under the <strong>Projects</strong> column, it shows no projects for our new scheme. We will create a new project and apply this scheme to it:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_005.jpg" alt="Creating new issue type schemes"/></div><p>
</p><p>At this moment, we need to create a new project to apply our customizations:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_006.jpg" alt="Creating new issue type schemes"/></div><p>
</p><p>Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Projects</strong> and in the <strong>Project list</strong> section, click on the <strong>Add Project</strong> button on top-right corner:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_007.jpg" alt="Creating new issue type schemes"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Create project</strong> popup, select <strong>Basic software development</strong> under <strong>SOFTWARE</strong> and press the <strong>Next</strong> button:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_008.jpg" alt="Creating new issue type schemes"/></div><p>
</p><p>The next popup will confirm your selection and display the <strong>ISSUE TYPES</strong> and <strong>WORKFLOW</strong> that you will get in this project. Just press the <strong>Select</strong> button to continue.</p><p>Enter the <strong>Name</strong> of our project as <code class="literal">Project For Test Management</code> and the project <strong>Key</strong> is <code class="literal">PFTM</code>. Click on the <strong>Submit</strong> button:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_009.jpg" alt="Creating new issue type schemes"/></div><p>
</p><p>Once this project has been created, go to the project sidebar and then <strong>Project Administration</strong> | <strong>Issue types</strong>. You will notice that, by default, <strong>PFTM: Scrum Issue Type Scheme </strong>is applied to the project. This is a new scheme created for this project only. We will change it and apply our own issue type scheme that we created earlier. In the top-right corner, click on the <strong>Actions</strong> menu and select <strong>Use a different scheme</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_010.jpg" alt="Creating new issue type schemes"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the next screen, you will get a list of all the available <strong>Issue Type Schemes</strong>; just select the <strong>Test Management Issue Type Scheme</strong> and click on the <strong>OK</strong> button:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_011.jpg" alt="Creating new issue type schemes"/></div><p>
</p><p>Now the project scheme has been changed and it now has the new issue types that we want. You can verify this by creating a new issue under this new project and seeing the list of all the available Issue Types that we wanted.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec33"/>Customizing the workflow for changes in transitions</h1></div></div></div><p>In any issue-tracking system, the issues will be created, then moved to the In Progress state, and finally Closed. This is the scenario of a simple workflow with three states: Open, In Progress, and Closed, which would only work in ideal cases, but in real-world cases, the workflows, that is, how the issue will move from one state to another, could be quite complex. For instance, sometimes you need to wait for some information from the client to act further on the issue; there could be a case when someone will review your task before closing. To incorporate such cases, we need the ability to modify these workflows.</p><p>Each company has its own processes and software models. In JIRA, it's possible to customize the workflow very easily. This is one of the most powerful features of JIRA. We can easily create new states and conditions. In this section, we will customize the workflow for a test campaign and a test case.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec39"/>Workflow for a test campaign</h2></div></div></div><p>A test campaign is a collection of test cases. We have already created its issue type. The user will start by creating a new issue of type test campaign and then all the test cases that are part of it will be created as a subtask.</p><p>A test campaign could be assigned to a specific team lead, who could further assign test cases among team members. The following diagram represents a typical workflow for a test campaign:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/B0568_04_12-1.jpg" alt="Workflow for a test campaign"/></div><p>
</p><p>The test campaign will be moved to the <strong>In Progress</strong> state while all the test cases are prepared and created as a subtask. Once the bundle of test cases are added and finalized, the test campaign will be <strong>Published</strong>. The <strong>Under Execution</strong> state signifies that the test cases under it are currently being executed.</p><p>Now, we need to create some additional states. These are not already there in the system. Also, we want to add a constraint that the test campaign can only be closed when all the test cases under it are closed as well, and only the reported can close the test campaign as condition in the JIRA terminology.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec13"/>New states</h3></div></div></div><p>The following are the new states:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Published</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Under Execution</strong></li></ul></div><p>Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Issues</strong> | <strong>Statuses</strong> (under <strong>Issue Attributes</strong>) and click on the <strong>Add status</strong> button in the top-right corner:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_013.jpg" alt="New states"/></div><p>
</p><p>Enter the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> of the status <code class="literal">Published</code> and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button to create the new state and repeat the same procedure to create <code class="literal">Under Execution</code>.</p><p>Now we need to create a workflow that we will associate with the test campaign. It's always a good practice to copy the default JIRA workflow <strong>jira</strong> and then modify it.</p><p>Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Issues</strong> | <strong>Workflows</strong> (under <strong>Workflows</strong>) and copy the default JIRA workflow <strong>jira (Read-only System Workflow)</strong> using the <strong>Copy</strong> link under <strong>Operations</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_014.jpg" alt="New states"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Copy Workflow: jira</strong> popup, enter the <strong>Workflow Name</strong> as <code class="literal">Test Campaign Workflow</code> and add a <strong>Description</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_015.jpg" alt="New states"/></div><p>
</p><p>Once the workflow has been copied, you will find two viewing tabs in the top-left corner: one is <strong>Diagram</strong> (which is the default tab) and the other one is <strong>Text</strong>. When the <strong>Diagram</strong> tab is enabled, it displays the graphical representation of the workflow. However, it's convenient to work in the <strong>Text</strong> tab.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec10"/>Removing unwanted transitions</h4></div></div></div><p>You will notice that the workflow, which we copied from the default <strong>jira</strong> workflow, has some unwanted transitions, such as <strong>Open</strong> to <strong>Resolved</strong>, <strong>Open</strong> to <strong>Closed</strong>, and so on. First, we need to delete these transitions. In the <strong>Text</strong> mode, under <strong>Operations</strong>, click on the <strong>Delete Transitions</strong> link:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_016.jpg" alt="Removing unwanted transitions"/></div><p>
</p><p>On the next screen, select the <strong>Resolve Issue</strong> and <strong>Close Issue</strong> transitions because we don't want them with the <strong>Open</strong> state:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_017.jpg" alt="Removing unwanted transitions"/></div><p>
</p><p>Click on the <strong>Delete</strong> button to delete the selected transitions. Perform the same procedure for all such unwanted transitions. Also, remove the states that are not required at all in the workflow, such as the <strong>Resolved</strong> state. You will see a link to delete the step, which is linked to a state, once there are no attached transitions.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec11"/>Adding new steps</h4></div></div></div><p>After removing all the unwanted transitions, add the new states using the form at the bottom of the <strong>Text</strong> mode. The states are added to the workflow by linking them with the <strong>Step Name</strong>, whose name is similar to the state name:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_018.jpg" alt="Adding new steps"/></div><p>
</p><p>Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button to add this state and repeat this for the <code class="literal">Published</code> one as well:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_019.jpg" alt="Adding new steps"/></div><p>
</p><p>You should now have all the states that are required.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec12"/>Adding the missing transitions</h4></div></div></div><p>Let's add the following missing transitions:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In Progress to Published</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Published to Reopened</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Published to Under Execution</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Under Execution to Closed</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Closed to Under Execution</li></ul></div><p>Under <strong>Operations</strong>, click on the <strong>Add Transition</strong> link for a specific step:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_020.jpg" alt="Adding the missing transitions"/></div><p>
</p><p>Enter the <strong>Transition Name</strong> as <code class="literal">Published</code>, enter some meaningful <strong>Description</strong>, and select <strong>Published</strong> as the <strong>Destination Step</strong>. It's also possible to prompt the user to fill in some data on a screen that can be shown while making this transition. From now onward, we will not do this. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button to continue. Repeat the same for all the other transitions that need to be created.</p><p>The transition names can also be added as a verb. For instance, the <code class="literal">Under Execution</code> transition can be added as <code class="literal">Start Execution</code>. This name appears to the user on the issue view screen.</p><p>Finally, your workflow will look similar to the following screenshots:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Workflow for <strong>Text</strong> mode:</li></ul></div><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_021.jpg" alt="Adding the missing transitions"/></div><p>
</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Workflow for <strong>Diagram </strong>mode:</li></ul></div><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_022.jpg" alt="Adding the missing transitions"/></div><p>
</p><p>Now our workflow has taken shape. We have all the states and transitions as we wanted. So, let's now add a few conditions to certain transitions.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec13"/>Conditions</h4></div></div></div><p>The following are the different conditions for a test campaign:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A test campaign will only close when all the test cases are Closed</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Only the reporter can move this test campaign to Closed</li></ul></div><p>The first condition will not allow the user to close the issue until all the test cases under it are in the Closed state. We want to add this condition when a transition from <strong>Under Execution</strong> to <strong>Closed</strong> is attempted:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go back to the <strong>Text</strong> mode and click on the <strong>Closed</strong> link under the <strong>Transition (id)</strong> column. Take a look at this screenshot for reference:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_023.jpg" alt="Conditions"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, you will get some advanced options for this transition from <strong>Under Execution</strong> to the <strong>Closed</strong> state. Under the <strong>Conditions</strong> tab, click on the <strong>Add condition</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_024.jpg" alt="Conditions"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the following screenshot, you will get a list of conditions that can be added to this transition. Select <strong>Sub-Task Blocking Condition</strong> and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_025.jpg" alt="Conditions"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, select the status for which this condition will be applicable. In our case, we want test cases to be in the Closed state, so we will select <strong>CLOSED</strong> from the list of various statuses available and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_026.jpg" alt="Conditions"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the same way, add one more condition called <code class="literal">Only Reporter Condition</code> for the <strong>Under Execution</strong> to <strong>Closed</strong> transition.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, we will have two conditions added to this transition, as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_027.jpg" alt="Conditions"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec14"/>Post Function</h4></div></div></div><p>The following is the use of the post function.</p><p>When the workflow transition has happened, then certain actions can be performed afterwards. For instance, when a test campaign is closed, we send an e-mail to everyone in a particular group.</p><p>We also want to send an e-mail to all the users who are part of a particular group to receive an e-mail when the test campaign is closed. The workflow can be configured to trigger an event on a state transition from <strong>Under Execution</strong> to <strong>Closed</strong>. The event can further be configured to send an e-mail to a group. We will learn that later in the chapter.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec14"/>Creating a new workflow scheme</h3></div></div></div><p>At this point, let's associate our workflow to the project. For this, we need to create a workflow scheme, which is a collection of one or more workflows mapped to the project issue types; to attach a workflow to the project, a workflow scheme is required:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Issues</strong> | <strong>Workflow Schemes</strong> (under <strong>WORKFLOWS</strong>) and click on the <strong>Add Workflow Scheme</strong> button in the top-right corner. In the <strong>Add Workflow Scheme</strong> screen, enter the <strong>Name</strong> of the scheme as <code class="literal">Test Management Workflow Scheme</code> and some useful <strong>Description</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_028.jpg" alt="Creating a new workflow scheme"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Once the scheme is created, the default <strong>JIRA Workflow</strong> will be assigned to all the <strong>Issue Types</strong>; however, in our case, we want the workflow that we just created assigned to the Test Campaign issue type:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_029.jpg" alt="Creating a new workflow scheme"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Add Workflow</strong> menu in the top-left corner and select <strong>Add Existing</strong>.<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_030.jpg" alt="Creating a new workflow scheme"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the preceding screenshot, select the workflow called <strong>Test Campaign Workflow</strong> and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_031.jpg" alt="Creating a new workflow scheme"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the preceding screenshot, select <strong>Test Campaign </strong>as the <strong>Issue Type</strong> and click on the <strong>Finish</strong> button. This will assign the workflow to the selected <strong>Issue Types</strong>. This is displayed in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_032.jpg" alt="Creating a new workflow scheme"/></div><p>
</p><p>Now, if you go back to our workflow scheme, you will notice that the <strong>Test Campaign</strong> issue type is using our custom workflow called<strong> Test Campaign Workflow</strong>.</p></li><li class="listitem">Go back to <strong>Project Administration</strong> | <strong>Workflows</strong> and click on the <strong>Switch Scheme</strong> button right next to the <strong>Add Workflow</strong> button in the top-left corner. On the next screen, select <strong>Test Management Workflow Scheme</strong> and click on the <strong>Associate</strong> button.</li></ol></div><p>The workflow scheme is now associated with the project and the workflow is now active. Note that the active workflows cannot be modified; JIRA will create a draft version for you for this and the modified workflows can be published again.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec15"/>Adding a custom event in JIRA</h3></div></div></div><p>Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>System</strong> | <strong>Events</strong> (under <strong>ADVANCED</strong>) and scroll down to the bottom of the page where there is an <strong>Add New Event</strong> form:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_033.jpg" alt="Adding a custom event in JIRA"/></div><p>
</p><p>Enter the <strong>Name</strong> of the event, then enter some useful <strong>Description</strong>, and select <strong>Issue Closed</strong> as the <strong>Template</strong> because the template of the e-mail will be similar to that of the one sent when the issue is closed. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button to continue. Creating an event doesn't do anything useful until we trigger it from the workflow and customize it in the notification scheme:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First, we need to trigger the event from the workflow. Let's go back to the <strong>Test Campaign Workflow</strong>, edit it, and click on the <strong>Closed</strong> link under the <strong>Transition (id)</strong> column. Now, go to the <strong>Post Functions</strong> tab; here, the last entry is for <strong>Generic Event</strong>. Edit it by clicking on the pencil sign in the bottom-right corner, as shown in this screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_034.jpg" alt="Adding a custom event in JIRA"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, we need to change the event from <strong>Generic Event</strong> to <strong>Email to Testers</strong>. Then, click on the <strong>Update</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_035.jpg" alt="Adding a custom event in JIRA"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Now the event will be triggered on the state transition, but there is still one more thing to perform to send the e-mail. The notification scheme of the project needs to be customized to configure to whom an e-mail will be sent when this event is triggered by the workflow.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl3sec16"/>Customizing a notification scheme</h3></div></div></div><p>To send e-mails, JIRA relies on notification schemes, which define who will receive the e-mail and when. As we already mentioned, JIRA comes with default schemes and it's always a good practice to copy them and customize your own copy. For this example too, we will copy the <strong>Default Notification Scheme</strong>:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Issues</strong> | <strong>Notification Schemes</strong>. Under <strong>Operations</strong>, click on the <strong>Copy</strong> link. It will copy the scheme instantly with the name <strong>Copy of Default Notification Scheme</strong>. Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> link under <strong>Operations</strong> for this scheme and rename it as <code class="literal">Test Management Notification Scheme</code>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_036.jpg" alt="Customizing a notification scheme"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Now, we need to customize this scheme to send an e-mail to all the users of a particular group. For this example, you can create a group called <code class="literal">jira-testers</code> and add a few users to it. <a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. User Management, Groups, and Project Roles">Chapter 7</a>, <em>User Management, Groups, and Project Roles</em> will have more information about managing users and groups. Once your group has been created, click on the <strong>Notifications</strong> link under <strong>Operations</strong> for the <strong>Test Management Notification Scheme</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, you will find the list of all the events and the concerned users, groups, or project roles who will receive these e-mails:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_037.jpg" alt="Customizing a notification scheme"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">You will also find the <strong>Email to Testers</strong> custom event that we created, but this is just the event listed in this scheme; we need to modify the scheme to add the <strong>jira-testers</strong> group in order to get notifications when this event is triggered by the workflow. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_038.jpg" alt="Customizing a notification scheme"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Select <strong>Group</strong> and from the drop-down menu, select <strong>jira-testers</strong>. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_04_039.jpg" alt="Customizing a notification scheme"/></div><p>
</p><p>Our scheme is now configured.</p></li><li class="listitem">Now, go to <strong>Project Administration</strong> | <strong>Notification</strong> and click on the <strong>Actions</strong> menu in the top-right corner and select <strong>Use a different scheme</strong>. On the next screen, select our new scheme as <strong>Test Management Notification Scheme</strong> and click on the <strong>Associate</strong> button.</li></ol></div><p>The project will now use the next scheme because the customized workflow is already assigned to the project. So, the e-mail notifications should work now whenever the test campaign is moved from Under Execution to the Closed state.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl2sec40"/>Workflow for a test case</h2></div></div></div><p>A test case contains information about the input, expected output along with a set of actions, and details of the environment that defines whether a requirement is met as per the original plan to verify it is working. We will configure JIRA for manual testing where we will store all this information as issue types.</p><p>We have already configured JIRA for a test campaign; in this section, we will not repeat the implementation, which is exactly similar to what we have just discussed. Instead, we will list the details of the workflow, conditions, and post functions:</p><p>

</p><p>A test case will be a subtask of a particular test campaign. Once created, it will first be moved to the <strong>In Progress</strong> state when the tester starts performing the tests. On the basis of these tests, it can be moved to one of the following states:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Blocked</strong>: If this test case is critical for other features to work</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Passed</strong>: If it works correctly</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Failed:</strong> If it's not working</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>In Review:</strong> If it requires further investigation</li></ul></div><p>Finally, a test case can either be <strong>Closed</strong> or <strong>Reopened</strong>. A particular test campaign can contain hundreds of test cases and its overall percentage of the verified testing can be calculated on the basis of how many test cases are closed.</p><p>Create a new workflow called <strong>Test Case Workflow</strong>, add it in <strong>Test Management Workflow Scheme</strong>, and assign it to the <strong>Test Case</strong> as <strong>Issue Type</strong>.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec15"/>New states</h3></div></div></div><p>We have identified a few new states that need to be created:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Blocked</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Passed</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Failed</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">In Review</li></ul></div><p>The procedure to create these states is similar to what we discussed previously for a test Campaign.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec16"/>Condition</h3></div></div></div><p>We want to impose the constraint that only the user who is assigned the test case will be able to move it to the <strong>Passed</strong> state:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Only the assignee can move the test case to the <strong>Passed</strong> state</li></ul></div><p>The name of the workflow condition is <strong>Only Assignee Condition</strong>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl4sec17"/>Post function</h3></div></div></div><p>When a test case fails, it might become important to understand what went wrong in the feature.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch04lvl1sec39"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we customized JIRA's instance to act like a test management tool. We started by gathering the requirements to implement such use cases in JIRA. You learned how to customize various schemes to introduce new issue types, custom workflows, field configurations, and project permissions.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to configure Zephyr, which is a popular JIRA add-on for test management. This add-on will bring standard features and built-in functionality to get you started for software testing without customizing JIRA. Many organizations use Zephyr and we will also learn how to use it for performing testing.</p></div></body></html>
