    chapter, we will talk more about GDPR case studies. The **General Data Protection
    Regulation** (**GDPR**) has set an enforcement date; May 25, 2018\. Any organization
    that has not complied with data protection rules by this date may face heavy fines.
    This chapter will take the GDPR compliance as a case study to apply to software
    development. It discusses the GDPR software security requirements it should include
    in coming releases. We will also explore some practical case studies, such as
    personal data discovery, data anonymization, cookie consent, data-masking implementation,
    and web privacy status.

    be configured as plain text, or a default value without encryption. The following
