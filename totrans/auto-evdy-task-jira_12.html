			<p>The ability to automate tasks and processes in Jira opens up a whole new world of possibilities for streamlining your projects and improving productivity.</p>
			<p>This, in turn, brings about its own complexities, and if approached in a haphazard manner, you could very well end up with a bunch of rules that instead of increasing productivity end up causing more pain than before you started.</p>
			<p>Having a set of guidelines to help you get the most out of your automation journey is what this chapter is all about.</p>
			<p>We will learn where to begin by planning your rules, before diving into implementing them and how to approach writing your rules to ensure you maximize performance. Finally, we will be looking at some best practices to organize your rules to make it easier to manage and maintain them.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we'll cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Planning your rules</li>
				<li>Thinking about performance</li>
				<li>Organizing your rules</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>The requirements for this chapter are as follows:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Planning your rules</h1>
			<p>Before you jump in and start creating automation rules, you should have a clear purpose about what you <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>want to automate and how to approach your desired outcome, and these are things that you should think about in the planning stages.</p>
			<p>Having an automation strategy in place first will ensure that your automation rules are fit for purpose, are efficient, and meet the objectives of the organization.</p>
			<p>In this section, we will look at some of the best practices for planning your rules.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Planning your automation strategy</h2>
			<p>It is worth keeping in <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>mind that the primary purpose of automation is to streamline your business and to ensure that your processes work more efficiently.</p>
			<p>When planning what to automate, one of the first things you should do is engage with your users. This will uncover valuable insight into which tasks they spend the most time doing and how you could leverage automation rules to increase their productivity.</p>
			<p>You should also take into account the usage patterns of existing requests in your system to identify whether there are any automation opportunities you could apply to improve overall efficiency.</p>
			<p>By planning your rules ahead of time and ensuring they align with your overall business and process objectives, you will have a clear idea of what you should automate to ensure the overall success of your automation efforts.</p>
			<p>Next, we'll look at why using the appropriate scope for your rules should be taken into account during rule planning.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Scoping your rules</h2>
			<p>As we saw in <a href="B16551_01_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor017"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Key Concepts of Automation</em>, rules in <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>Jira can be applied in one of four scopes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Single or project-specific rules</strong>: This scope is applied automatically to a rule when it is created <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>within a project. An example rule in this scope would be the scheduled creation of a project-specific task.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Multi-project rules</strong>: This scope is enabled by naming specific projects to which a rule applies and can only <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>be applied by a Jira administrator. An example of a rule in this scope would be keeping software versions in sync between two projects.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Global rules</strong>: This scope is applied automatically when a rule is created from the global administration <a id="_idIndexMarker483"/>view by Jira administrators. Rules in this scope apply to every project in the instance. An example rule in this scope would be to close an issue when it is marked as a duplicate.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project type-specific rules in the Jira cloud</strong>: This scope is applicable to the Jira cloud only and allows a <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>rule to be applied to all projects of a specific type. For example, a rule to close a customer request that has not been updated for 5 business days could be applied to all <em class="italic">service projects</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is an important aspect to consider as part of the planning for your automation rules.</p>
			<p>One of the main purposes of using automation is to improve the efficiency of processes and this is true when deciding how to scope the automation rules themselves.</p>
			<p>It is common for multiple projects in a Jira instance to share workflows and other common configurations. In the case where a rule is also common across projects, it is more efficient to maintain a single rule than to have duplicate rules that need to be maintained individually.</p>
			<p>This obviously needs to be balanced with the fact that global and multi-project rules can only be maintained by users <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>with global Jira administrator permissions and not by project administrators.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-165"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Thinking about rule design</h2>
			<p>Once you have determined how your rules fit in with the overall business and process strategy for your <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>organization, the next thing to focus on is designing the actual automation rules themselves.</p>
			<p>One of the key principles of automation is to simplify processes and reduce repeatable work, so you want to try and avoid creating rules that are overly complex and difficult to understand.</p>
			<p>Your rules should be atomic and it should be as simple as possible to get the stated task done. Always keep in mind that automation rules usually persist long after the original author has moved on to other endeavors and they should be straightforward enough that others can understand how the rules work and how they work together.</p>
			<p>This leads us on to the next point: documenting your rules. It is always good practice to document every rule. You should include in the documentation the business case for the rule, which should align with your existing stated business goals.</p>
			<p>The documentation for the rule should also include any dependencies the rule has on other rules or external systems. For example, if the rule can be triggered by the completion of another rule, this should be included in the documentation.</p>
			<p>Ensuring your rules are well documented achieves a couple of things:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It ensures business continuity. When the original rule author moves on, their replacements can quickly understand the purpose behind the rules.</li>
				<li>It promotes visibility. Other project administrators can quickly see whether there are any existing rules that could be utilized in their projects instead of reinventing the wheel.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Lastly, you should keep a copy of your rules in a version control system such as Bitbucket or GitHub. Not only will this ensure you have backups of each rule, but it will also allow you to keep track of the change history of each rule.</p>
			<p>You will undoubtedly come across a situation where someone performs a change to a rule that, in the best case, causes some minor errors, or at worst, causes a major incident.</p>
			<p>Having the ability to quickly roll back the offending rule to a known working version will enable you to resolve these types of incidents efficiently.</p>
			<p>Automation for Jira allows you to export a copy of each rule that can be downloaded in JSON format and that you can then save in your version control system of choice.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, we can see how clicking on the ellipsis (<strong class="bold">…</strong>) button to the right of an individual rule gives you the option to export the rule:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_09.1_B16551.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1 – Exporting an individual rule to JSON&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1 – Exporting an individual rule to JSON</p>
			<p>Jira administrators <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>also have the option of exporting all the automation rules in the system in a single, downloadable, JSON-formatted file.</p>
			<p>Doing this on a scheduled basis and storing the resultant file in version control will allow an administrator to quickly restore all the automation rules across every project in the case of a more widespread incident.</p>
			<p>Jira administrators can perform this operation from the global administrative interface by navigating to the <strong class="bold">System</strong> menu using the cog icon and then selecting the <strong class="bold">Automation rules</strong> tab from the left-hand menu.</p>
			<p>You can use the ellipsis (<strong class="bold">…</strong>) button to the right of the <strong class="bold">Create rule</strong> button to access the menu option to export all the rules, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_09.2_B16551.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2 – Exporting all rules to JSON&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.2 – Exporting all rules to JSON</p>
			<p>Now that we've understood some of the best practices around planning your rules, let's take a look at an example to illustrate this.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Creating a rule to synchronize high-priority bugs</h2>
			<p>For this example, we <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>are going to use the <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>following scenario.</p>
			<p>We have two software projects in Jira, <em class="italic">My Application</em> with the project key <em class="italic">MAPP</em>, which the development team uses to track their development work, and <em class="italic">My Application Support</em> with the project key <em class="italic">MAPS</em>, which allows customers to report bugs and raise other requests without inundating the development project with spurious issues.</p>
			<p>After speaking with the application support team, we have discovered that manually triaging the highest priority bugs and creating linked development bugs is time-consuming and error-prone. We have also ascertained that there are strict checks in place to limit the creation of the highest priority bugs. The support team can also raise the priority of a bug if required.</p>
			<p>Let's use this information to create an automation rule to deal with these particular bugs:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>We are going to create a global rule as more than one project is involved, so only a Jira administrator can create this rule.<p>Click the settings (cog) menu in the top menu bar and select <strong class="bold">System</strong>. Then, select the <strong class="bold">Automation rules</strong> tab in the left-hand menu and finally, click <strong class="bold">Create rule</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>The rule needs to work both when the issue is created and when the priority is manually raised, so select the <strong class="bold">Multiple issue events</strong> trigger and in the <strong class="bold">Issue events</strong> field, select <strong class="bold">Issue Created</strong> and <strong class="bold">Issue Updated</strong>. Click <strong class="bold">Save</strong>.</li>
				<li>The rule <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>should only apply to bugs <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>in the MAPS project where the priority is highest.<p>Select <strong class="bold">New condition</strong>, followed by <strong class="bold">JQL condition</strong>. Type the following query into the <strong class="bold">JQL</strong> field and click <strong class="bold">Save</strong>:</p><pre><strong class="bold">Project = MAPS AND type = Bug AND priority = Highest</strong></pre></li>
				<li>To ensure we don't create multiple bugs in the development project when priorities are changed multiple times, we need to add a further condition to the rule.<p>Select <code>Linked issues</code></p><p><code>relates to</code></p><p><code>Are not present</code></p></li>
				<li>Next, we want to create a linked bug in the MAPP project.<p>Select <code>Affects versions</code>, <code>Priority</code>, and <code>Linked Issues</code> fields.</p><p>Complete the fields as follows and then click <code>My Application (MAPP)</code></p><p><code>Same issue type</code></p><p><code>relates to</code></p><p><code>Trigger issue</code></p><p>The rule should look similar to the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_9.3_B16551.jpg" alt="Figure 9.3 – A rule to create linked bugs between projects&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.3 – A rule to create linked bugs between projects</p></li>
				<li>Finally, name <a id="_idIndexMarker494"/>the rule <code>Sync highest priority support bugs</code> and <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>click <strong class="bold">Turn it on</strong> to save and enable the rule.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>We have learned in this section how planning your rules in advance and ensuring they fit within your overall business and process strategies and are properly documented and controlled will ensure the ultimate success of your automation efforts.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Atlassian provides a library of templates that you can use as a starting point for your rules. In addition, an Automation Playground is also provided, which you can use to explore the various rule components and create dummy rules. You can access both of these at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library">https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/automation-template-library</a>.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we will take a look at some best practices to follow that will ensure that the rules you write perform efficiently and keep your Jira instance responsive and running smoothly.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-167"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Thinking about performance</h1>
			<p>When planning automation rules for any system, you should ensure that they perform efficiently and do not <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>consume more resources than absolutely necessary. This is essential to maintaining a well-behaved and responsive system.</p>
			<p>You are introducing automation to enhance productivity and optimize time-consuming processes. The last thing you want is for the automation themselves to have a negative impact on the system performance.</p>
			<p>The automation engine in Jira is designed to maximize performance wherever possible; however, there are some considerations you can take into account when authoring your rules to ensure they perform at their best. We'll take a look at some of these considerations in this section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Using project-specific rules</h2>
			<p>The scope of a rule plays <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>an important part when <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>it comes to performance. It determines how many executions are initially queued for a given rule.</p>
			<p>If you have 50 projects, for example, and a single global rule that uses the <em class="italic">Create issue</em> trigger, the rule engine will queue 50 executions when the Create issue event is fired, 1 execution per matching project.</p>
			<p>If you add another global rule using the Create issue trigger, 100 executions will be queued, that is, 1 execution per matching trigger per matching project.</p>
			<p>As you can see, applying too wide a scope can quickly lead to potential performance issues.</p>
			<p>In general, though, the majority of the rules you create will usually be specific to a particular project and the scope should be limited to that project.</p>
			<p>Scoping the rule to only the project or projects where it is actually required will ensure that only the minimum number of rule executions will be queued for a given event.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we'll look at how choosing the appropriate triggers can lead to the optimized performance of your rules.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Using the appropriate triggers</h2>
			<p>Another way of ensuring <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>maximum performance is to <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>use an appropriate trigger for your rule. This consideration is particularly useful when your rules are reliant on changes to specific fields.</p>
			<p>For example, if you have a rule that should sum all the story points of sub-tasks into the parent task, you could use the <strong class="bold">Issue updated</strong> trigger, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_09.4_B16551.jpg" alt="Figure 9.4 – Using an Issue updated trigger for the rule&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.4 – Using an Issue updated trigger for the rule</p>
			<p>While this approach is not incorrect and will work perfectly well, a more efficient approach is to use the <strong class="bold">Field value changed</strong> trigger and further limit this to the <strong class="bold">Edit issue</strong> operation, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_09.5_B16551.jpg" alt="Figure 9.5 – Using the more efficient Field value changed trigger&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.5 – Using the more efficient Field value changed trigger</p>
			<p>The reason for this again lies in the <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>fact that when an event is <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>triggered in Jira, the automation engine will queue rule executions that match the trigger.</p>
			<p>In the preceding example, using the <strong class="bold">Issue updated</strong> trigger will match all the rules that are configured with an <strong class="bold">Issue updated</strong> trigger. If, for example, you have 10 rules that use the <strong class="bold">Issue updated</strong> trigger, changing the <strong class="bold">Story Points</strong> field in a sub-task will result in 10 rule executions to be queued for processing. This is because the rule engine won't know exactly which <strong class="bold">Issue updated</strong> rule is relevant.</p>
			<p>Changing the rule to use the <strong class="bold">Field value changed</strong> trigger and monitoring only the <strong class="bold">Story Points</strong> field for the <strong class="bold">Edit issue</strong> operation will cause only a single rule execution to be queued, assuming there are no other rules that use this exact same trigger configuration.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Choosing the right conditions</h2>
			<p>Conditions are used to <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>narrow the scope of the rule by <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>restricting which issues will be affected by further actions in the rule.</p>
			<p>The most efficient rules are those that have the least number of issues against which to perform additional actions, so excluding issues that do not need to be processed as early in the rule execution chain as possible will ensure that your rules run as efficiently as possible.</p>
			<p>Additionally, not all conditions are created equal. When deciding on which condition to use, the best approach is to consider using the most efficient and performant condition as early as possible.</p>
			<p>The conditions listed in order of efficiency, with the highest performance first, are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Issue fields condition</li>
				<li>Advanced compare condition</li>
				<li>JQL condition</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Issue fields</strong> condition works <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>on data already present in the rule at the point where the condition is evaluated and uses simple comparisons to compare the field against a constant value or set of values. As no further processing is required to evaluate, this is the most efficient condition available to your rules.</p>
			<p>Where you have multiple fields to compare, you can chain multiple Issue fields conditions together to perform more advanced comparisons and still maintain the overall performance.</p>
			<p>The next condition in order of <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>performance is the <strong class="bold">Advanced compare</strong> condition. This condition allows the use of smart values and regular expressions and therefore these first need to be resolved before the condition can be evaluated.</p>
			<p>Similar to the <em class="italic">Issue fields</em> condition, you can chain multiple <em class="italic">Advanced compare </em>conditions together to perform more complex comparisons.</p>
			<p>Lastly, the <strong class="bold">JQL</strong> condition is the <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>most expensive of these three conditions. It also lets you use the full power of Jira's search facility in your comparisons. The JQL condition can also <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>contain smart values and if used, these <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>first need to be evaluated before the query can be sent to Jira for execution.</p>
			<p>Let's re-examine the rule to synchronize the highest priority bugs, which we introduced in the <em class="italic">Planning your rules</em> section, to see how we can optimize its performance.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Optimizing a rule for performance</h2>
			<p>In the first iteration of <a id="_idIndexMarker510"/>this rule, we created a global rule using the <em class="italic">Multiple issue events</em> trigger. As we learned, this could potentially have a performance impact on our Jira instance.</p>
			<p>This is due to the fact that we used a global scope for the rule as it applies to more than one project. We also used a Multiple issue events trigger to listen for issue creation and update events. Finally, we used a <em class="italic">JQL condition</em> to narrow the scope of the rule, which we have learned is the least efficient condition available to us.</p>
			<p>Let's update the rule to take these performance issues into consideration:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">As a Jira administrator, click the settings (cog) menu in the top menu bar and select <strong class="bold">System</strong>. Then, select the <strong class="bold">Automation rules</strong> tab in the left-hand menu and finally, click on the <strong class="bold">Sync highest priority support bugs</strong> rule.</li>
				<li>Firstly, we'll update the trigger to the <em class="italic">Field value changed</em> trigger.<p>Click on the <strong class="bold">When: Rule is triggered on</strong> component in the rule-chain view on the left.</p><p>Next, click the pencil icon to the right of <strong class="bold">Multiple issue events</strong> to change the trigger.</p></li>
				<li>Select the <code>Priority</code></p><p><code>Create issue</code> and <code>Edit issue</code></p></li>
				<li>Next, we are going to switch out the <em class="italic">JQL condition</em> for the more efficient <em class="italic">Issue fields condition</em>. We will do this using an <em class="italic">if/else block</em> to make the rule easier to read.<p>Select <strong class="bold">New condition</strong> followed by <strong class="bold">If/else block</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>Click the <code>Project</code></p><p><code>equals</code></p><p><code>My Application Support (MAPS)</code></p></li>
				<li>Click the <code>Issue Type</code></p><p><code>equals</code></p><p><code>Bug</code></p></li>
				<li>Click the <code>Priority</code></p><p><code>equals</code></p><p><code>Highest</code></p></li>
				<li>Click the <code>Linked issues</code></p><p><code>relates to</code></p><p><code>Are not present</code></p></li>
				<li>Delete the <strong class="bold">If: Issue matches JQL</strong> condition. You can do this by clicking the <strong class="bold">X</strong> in the top-right corner of the component in the rule-chain view, or by selecting the component and clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the name, <strong class="bold">JQL condition</strong>.</li>
				<li>Delete the <strong class="bold">If: Linked issues not present</strong> condition by either clicking the <strong class="bold">X</strong> in the top-right corner <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>of the component in the rule-chain view or by selecting the component and clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the component name.</li>
				<li>We then need to move the <strong class="bold">Create issue</strong> action into the <strong class="bold">If…else block</strong>. This is achieved by clicking and dragging the action in the rule-chain view and dropping it between the <strong class="bold">If: all match component</strong> and <strong class="bold">Add component</strong> link.</li>
				<li>The final step is to change the scope of the rule. Click on <code>Multiple projects</code></p><p><code>My Application Support (MAPS)</code> and <code>My Application (MAPP)</code></p><p>The rule should now look similar to the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_09.6_B16551_new.jpg" alt="Figure 9.6 – Optimizing the rule for performance&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6 – Optimizing the rule for performance</p></li>
				<li>Finally, click on <strong class="bold">Publish changes</strong> to save the changes we made to the rule.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>have learned that using the correct scope for your rules can have an impact on performance. We also learned how choosing the appropriate triggers and conditions can keep our rules performing optimally by choosing the most efficient components.</p>
			<p>In the next section, we'll take a look at how to organize rules to make them easier to keep track of and manage.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Organizing your rules</h1>
			<p>Over time, as you <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>automate more and more tasks in more and more of your projects, it is going to become more complex to manage and keep track of all your automation rules.</p>
			<p>The best way to deal with an ever-increasing number of automation rules, and configurations in general, is to logically organize each rule.</p>
			<p>In this section, we'll look at some best practices to keep your rules optimally organized, which will make them easier to find and manage.</p>
			<p>We'll start by looking at what should be a familiar concept to anyone who has had to deal with maintaining large numbers of system configurations: naming conventions.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Using naming conventions</h2>
			<p>Using a well-defined <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>naming convention allows <a id="_idIndexMarker516"/>users to consistently identify rules and allows you to organize your rules in a meaningful way.</p>
			<p>A good naming convention needs to be planned in advance, documented, and made visible to everyone who is going to be managing automation rules.</p>
			<p>The list of automation rules in Jira is arranged alphabetically and you should make use of this fact when designing your naming convention as it will allow you to group related items together.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You can sort your automation rules by any of the columns available when working in the list. However, the sort order will always default to alphabetically ascending by name.</p>
			<p>For example, your naming convention could state that each rule should be prefixed by the issue type to which it applies. In a software project, this could be something similar to <code>Bug</code>, <code>Epic</code>, <code>Story</code>, <code>Task</code>, and the like. This way, it is immediately apparent what the rule operates on and these rules will always be grouped together when sorted by name.</p>
			<p>Apart from establishing naming conventions, it is also good practice to describe in detail what each rule does, using the <strong class="bold">Description</strong> field. This will make it immediately clear to anyone looking at the list of rules what in fact is actually happening in the rule without needing to inspect each rule.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, you can see an example of how using a naming convention will group the rules together:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_09.7_B16551_new.jpg" alt="Figure 9.7 – The rule list with naming conventions applied&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.7 – The rule list with naming conventions applied</p>
			<p>Additionally, you <a id="_idIndexMarker517"/>can see that by using the rule description to <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>clearly document what the rule is actually doing, it makes it easier to quickly navigate and manage the list of automation rules.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Labeling your rules</h2>
			<p>In addition to using a <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>naming convention, you can, and should, also <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>define labels to categorize and identify your automation rules.</p>
			<p>A <strong class="bold">label</strong> in the context of <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>automation rules is a color-coded keyword that you can assign to your automation rules to more easily identify them.</p>
			<p>Ideally, you should use short, functional terms for your labels; some examples of functional labels could be the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer notifications</strong>: For rules that <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>send notifications to customers</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Internal notifications</strong>: For rules that send <a id="_idIndexMarker523"/>notifications to team members</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Support</strong>: For rules that <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/>deal with support issues</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Synchronization</strong>: For rules <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>that deal with keeping issues or other items in sync</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Software releases</strong>: For rules <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>dealing with versioning in software projects</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The preceding list is only a small sample of possible functional label names that you could use in your projects.</p>
			<p>Additionally, automation rules can be assigned to multiple labels. For example, a rule that creates a linked bug from a support project into the development project could be labeled with both the <strong class="bold">Support</strong> label and the <strong class="bold">Synchronization</strong> label.</p>
			<p>To create a new label, or <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>to use an existing label that has been <a id="_idIndexMarker528"/>previously defined, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Add label</strong> button in the rule list view on the left.</li>
				<li>Enter a name for your label in the <strong class="bold">Enter label name</strong> field.</li>
				<li>Optionally, select a color by clicking on the colored block to the right of the field.<p>If the label has been previously defined, it will show up in a list below the label name field as you begin typing.</p></li>
				<li>To use a previously defined label, simply click on its name.</li>
				<li>Once you have defined the label name and color, click <strong class="bold">Done</strong>.<p>You can see how a label is created in the following screenshot:</p></li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.8 – Adding a new label</p>
			<p>Now that you have labels <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>defined, you need to assign your rules to <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>the appropriate labels. You do this by clicking and dragging the rule onto the appropriate label.</p>
			<p>Once you have created your labels and assigned your rules accordingly, it becomes much easier to manage large numbers of automation rules by selecting the appropriate label to narrow down the list of rules, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Now that we've gained some insight into how we can organize our rules, let's apply this to the rule we optimized in the <em class="italic">Optimizing a rule for performance</em> section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Naming and labeling a rule</h2>
			<p>Let's complete our <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>rule to synchronize the highest priority issues <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>by using a naming convention. We <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>will also use the <strong class="bold">Description</strong> field to describe what the rule is doing <a id="_idIndexMarker534"/>and then we'll label it appropriately:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">As a Jira administrator, click the settings (cog) menu in the top menu bar and select <strong class="bold">System</strong>. Then, select the <strong class="bold">Automation rules</strong> tab in the left-hand menu and finally, click on the <strong class="bold">Sync highest priority support bugs</strong> rule.</li>
				<li>In the <code>Bug – Sync highest priority support bugs</code></p><p><code>When a Bug in the MAPS project is created with a priority of Highest or the priority is updated to Highest, create a linked Bug in the MAPP project.</code></p></li>
				<li>Click <strong class="bold">Publish changes</strong> to save the rule, and then click <strong class="bold">Return to list</strong> to return to the list of rules.</li>
				<li>Create two labels, called <strong class="bold">Synchronization</strong> and <strong class="bold">Support</strong>, and then click and drag the <strong class="bold">Bug – Sync highest priority support bugs</strong> rule onto each label in turn.<p>The rule should now <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>look similar to the following screenshot <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>when listed <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>along with other <a id="_idIndexMarker538"/>rules:</p></li>
			</ol>

			<p>We have learned that using a naming convention to organize your rules makes it easier to find and manage them. In addition, using the <strong class="bold">Description</strong> field to create a narrative for the rule helps you to quickly identify what the rule is doing. Finally, combining this by applying functional labels will save you both time and frustration when it comes to maintaining your rules in the long term.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-176"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Using a checklist</h1>
			<p>When you are creating your rules, you are not always going to remember all the various points we have discussed in <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>this chapter to ensure that your rules<a id="_idTextAnchor156"/> follow best practices.</p>
			<p>Having a checklist that you can quickly reference can help in ensuring that you have followed both the best practices we have presented in this chapter and any organizational guidance you have prepared.</p>
			<p>We have, therefore, put together a basic checklist that you can use as a starting point to create a checklist in the format that suits you best:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The rule is correctly scoped to only the project or projects that are affected.</li>
				<li>The rule is documented and includes a business case and implementation approach.</li>
				<li>The rule has been exported and stored in a version control system such as GitHub or Bitbucket.</li>
				<li>An appropriate trigger was used, such as Field value changed rather than Issue updated.</li>
				<li>The rule is using the most efficient conditions, such as the Issue fields condition, and only relies on more expensive conditions later in the rule as necessary.</li>
				<li>The rule is named according to the documented naming conventions.</li>
				<li>The rule description sufficiently describes what the rule is doing.</li>
				<li>The rule is assigned to the appropriate functional labels.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that you have a checklist in place, you will be able to use it to quickly identify that your rules follow all the guidelines that you have put in place. In turn, this will ensure that your rules are both manageable and less likely to contribute to performance issues in the long run.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned about some of the best practices to follow when planning, implementing, and organizing your automation rules.</p>
			<p>We learned that you should plan your automation strategy upfront to align with your business and process objectives to ensure the ultimate success of your automation efforts in Jira.</p>
			<p>We also learned that to ensure business continuity and to avoid unnecessary duplication of effort, your rules should be properly documented in an external system such as Confluence and made visible to the appropriate team members.</p>
			<p>Additionally, you should also understand the importance of maintaining external copies of your rules in a version control system such as Bitbucket or GitHub to ensure that any inadvertent breaking changes to rules can be quickly resolved by importing the last known working version of the rule.</p>
			<p>Next, we learned how to approach rule writing with performance in mind by using the appropriate project scopes when defining automation rules, and we learned why it is important to use the right triggers and conditions to ensure the optimal performance of automation rules.</p>
			<p>Finally, we learned how you could define and use naming conventions to group your rules based on the fact that rules are organized alphabetically by default. We also learned how to use the labeling feature to create labels to organize our rules by functionality.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we'll look at some tips and techniques to debug your automation rules and how to understand and use service limits and performance insights to monitor the automation rules in your Jira instance.</p>
