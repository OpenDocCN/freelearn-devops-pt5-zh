- en: 'If you read one of the other books in *The DevOps Toolkit Series* ([http://www.devopstoolkitseries.com/](http://www.devopstoolkitseries.com/)),
    you already know that I am a huge fan of containers, schedulers, and orchestrators.
    *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized
    Microservices* ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M))
    started as an overview of many different DevOps tools and practices, with containers
    having an important, but not a decisive role. In the meantime, I fell in utter
    and complete love with Docker and Swarm, so I chose to write *The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit:
    Docker Swarm: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker
    Swarm clusters* ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914)).
    By the time I finished it, I felt that some advanced topics were not explored
    and deserve a book on its own. *The DevOps 2.2 Toolkit: Self-Sufficient Docker
    Clusters: Building Self-Adaptive And Self-Healing Docker Clusters* ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/1979347190](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1979347190))
    was born.'

    felt that Kubernetes deserves its own space. Truth be told, I was negative about
    it a few years ago. It was too complicated for most use cases. It was enough to
    try installing it and, after days of struggle, give up. However, Kubernetes has
    come a long way since then. Even though its founding principles are the same,
    with time, it became more mature, more straightforward, and much bigger. Today,
    it is the biggest and the most adopted container orchestration platform. Some
    of the most prominent software companies rallied around it. Many startups emerged
    with new solutions. The open source community behind Kubernetes is one of the
    biggest in the history of software development. The community is vibrant, fast
    moving, and with a lot of vested interest in seeing Kubernetes succeed. Even Docker
    chose to support it and join the community. Kubernetes has a bright future ahead,
    and no one should ignore it.

    Mesos, Nomad, or something else), you might wonder whether it makes sense for
    you to invest time learning Kubernetes. I think it does. We should always be on
    a lookout for different solutions. Otherwise, we’re being forced to choose one
    blindly. No matter whether you decide to adopt Kubernetes or to stick with something
    else, I’ll argue that you should know how it works and what it offers. It’s all
    about making an educated decision.

- en: The goal of this book is not to convince you to adopt Kubernetes but to provide
    a detailed overview of its features. I want you to become confident in your Kubernetes
    knowledge and only then choose whether to embrace it. That is, unless you already
    made up your mind and stumbled upon this book in search of Kubernetes guidance.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The plan is to cover all aspects behind Kubernetes, from basic to advanced features.
    We’ll go not only through the tools behind the official project but also third-party
    add-ons. I hope that, by the time you finish reading this book, you will be able
    to call yourself “Kubernetes ninja”. I cannot say that you will know everything
    there is to know about the Kubernetes ecosystem. That would be impossible to accomplish
    since its growing faster than any single person could follow. What I can say is
    that you will be very confident in running a Kubernetes cluster of any scale in
    production.

- en: Like all my other books, this one is very hands-on. There will be just enough
    theory for you to understand the principles behind each topic. The book is packed
    with examples, so I need to give you a heads up. Do not buy this book if you’re
    planning to read it on a bus or in bed before going to sleep. You will need to
    be in front of your computer. A terminal will be your best friend. `kubectl` will
    be your lover.

- en: The book assumes that you feel comfortable with containers, especially Docker.
    We won’t go into details how to build an image, what is container registry, and
    how to write Dockerfile. I hope you already know all that. If that’s not the case,
    you might want to postpone reading this and learn at least basic container operations.
    This book is about things that happen after you built your images and stored them
    in a registry.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is about running containers at scale and not panicking when problems
    arise. It is about the present and the future of software deployment and monitoring.
    It’s about embracing the challenges and staying ahead of the curve.

    Slack channel and post your thoughts, ask questions, or participate in a discussion.
    If you prefer a more one-on-one communication, you can use Slack to send me a
    private message or send an email to `viktor@farcic.com`. All the books I wrote
    are very dear to me, and I want you to have a good experience reading them. Part
    of that experience is the option to reach out to me. Don’t be shy.

- en: Please note that this one, just as the previous books, is self-published. I
    believe that having no intermediaries between the writer and the reader is the
    best way to go.  It allows me to write faster, update the book more frequently,
    and have a more direct communication with you. Your feedback is part of the process.
    No matter whether you purchased the book while only a few or all chapters were
    written, the idea is that it will never be truly finished. As time passes, it
    will require updates so that it is aligned with the change in technology or processes.
    When possible, I will try to keep it up to date and release updates whenever that
    makes sense. Eventually, things might change so much that updates are not a good
    option anymore, and that will be a sign that a whole new book is required. I will
    keep writing as long as I continue getting your support**.**
