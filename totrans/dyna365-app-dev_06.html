<p>In the previous chapter, we learned how we can use Microsoft PowerApps to easily create custom business apps. In this chapter, we will learn about Microsoft Flow, which can be defined as a cloud-based service that enables users to build workflows that automate different tasks and processes across multiple applications and services.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will be covering the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is Microsoft Flow?</li>
<li>Microsoft Flow in the context of Dynamics 365</li>
<li>Automating processes using Microsoft Flow</li>
<li>The differences between Dynamics Workflow and Microsoft Flow</li>
</ul>

<p>As described earlier, Microsoft Flow is a cloud-based service that allows us to create automated workflows between different applications and services. The list of applications and services we can use with Microsoft Flow is constantly expanding. Currently, Microsoft Flow supports more than 170 service connectors, which includes popular applications like Dynamics 365, Office 365 Outlook, OneDrive for Business, SharePoint, Twitter, and Facebook.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For a full list of the available connectors in Microsoft Flow, visit the following link:<br/>
<a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/">https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/</a></div>
<p>If this is not enough, we can also build our own connector for our RESTful API that uses JSON.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Create custom connectors in Microsoft Flow at <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/register-custom-api/">https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/register-custom-api/</a></span></div>
<p>Apart from cloud-based services, we can also connect to on-premise data sources. To connect to on-premise data sources like SharePoint, SQL Server, Oracle, and so on, we can create an on-premise data gateway.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Manage an on-premise data gateway in Microsoft Flow at <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/">https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/</a></span></div>
<p>Microsoft Flow comes with predefined templates. Templates are prebuilt flows around popular services and scenarios, which we can start using immediately. We can use existing templates to create a flow or if a particular scenario is not covered by existing templates, we can create our own flow from scratch—that is, create one from the beginning.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For a full list of templates in Microsoft Flow, go to the following link:<br/>
<span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/">https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/templates/</a></span></div>
<p>Some of the most popular templates available are:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Save Office 365 email attachments to OneDrive for business</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Send myself a reminder in 10 minutes</span></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Get a push notification when I receive an email from my boss</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These templates are divided into categories such as approval, button, collect data, email, mobile, notifications, and so on. The templates can also be sorted by <span class="packt_screen">Name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Popularity</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Published Time</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/72114e06-c50e-4223-8167-207092521f12.png"/></div>
<p>To create a flow, we need to sign in using an existing Microsoft account (either work, school, or personal) or else we need to Sign Up first.</p>
<p>Go to Microsoft Flow's home page (<span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://flow.microsoft.com">https://flow.microsoft.com</a></span>) and click on <span class="packt_screen">Sign in</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Sign up free</span>:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Before we dive further into creating a flow, let's first understand what features are offered by different Microsoft Flow plans. Basically, there are two Microsoft Flow plans—a free plan and a premium plan.</p>
<p>The free plan, <span class="packt_screen">Flow Free</span>, includes unlimited flow creation, 750 runs per month (per user), and 15-minute checks (if a flow is triggered in less than 15 minutes after its last run, it will be queued).</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Flow Plan 1</span>, which is paid, comes with unlimited flow creation, 4,500 runs per month, and 3-minute checks. It also includes premium connectors such as Salesforce, Common Data Service, Adobe Creative Cloud, and others.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Check out the full list of premium connectors here:<br/>
<span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/?filter=&amp;category=premium">https://flow.microsoft.com/en-us/connectors/?filter=&amp;category=premium</a><br/></span></div>
<p>Following are some of the premium connectors, such as <span class="packt_screen">Salesforce</span>, <span class="packt_screen">DB2</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">DocuSign</span>, amongst others:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5e23de25-e36f-4627-a914-4bc453199843.png"/></div>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Flow Plan 2</span> comes with unlimited flow creation, 15,000 runs per month, and 1-minute checks, along with premium connectors. A 90-day free trial is available for <span class="packt_screen">Flow Plan 1</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Flow Plan 2</span>.</p>
<p>Apart from the above plans, there are Dynamics 365 plans, as well as Office 365 plans, that include Microsoft Flow. These plans come with unlimited flow creation, 2,000 runs per month, and a flow frequency of 5 minutes. However, they don't include premium connectors. Following are the two plans that come with Dynamics 365 applications:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>We've covered the differences between the different plans for Microsoft Flow, which can help us in deciding the right plan for us. Now let's understand the different components within a flow.</p>
<p>The different components of a flow are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Services</strong>: Services can be defined as the different applications that Microsoft Flow connects to, such as Twitter, SharePoint, Facebook, and so on. These services can act as sources as well as destinations within a Flow. Following is a list of a few of the services that come with Microsoft Flow. Currently, there are 160 services supported, and the list keeps growing.</li>
<li><strong>Triggers</strong>: Triggers are the starting point of the flow. They can be a manual trigger from a button in Microsoft Flow that needs to be manually initiated by the end user, or they can be automated, scheduled to run at a specific time or started from another application or service. A trigger can also be vent-based; when an event occurs in the service, it will trigger the flow. For example, a lead record being created in CRM or a new item being added in SharePoint's list can be the trigger. The following is a list of triggers specific to Dynamics 365:
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="326" src="assets/a9b8453c-81b0-470f-bd34-77df3f2d5274.png" width="439"/></div>
</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong>: Actions define the steps to be taken when a flow is triggered or, in other words, the output of the workflow execution. Actions could be things like sending an email, creating a record, posting on social media such as Twitter or Facebook, and so on. The following is a list of actions that are specific to Dynamics 365:</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="325" src="assets/403b1e6a-f3cd-4cc1-af0c-0a8d03c94399.png" width="453"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conditions</strong>: Conditions can be used to put <kbd>if/then</kbd> branch logic inside Flow. They basically include the <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> path and No path that a flow can take based on the output of the condition:</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/dd14a85e-0cd7-4591-8672-024f67ac2687.png"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Loops and switch</strong>: Using loops, we can iterate over the action and execute it multiple times, or only once, when a specific condition is met. This can be done using <span class="packt_screen">Apply to each</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Do-Until</span> steps in the action. Similarly, the <span class="packt_screen">Switch</span> step can be used to specify a switch case like logic within an action:</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="139" src="assets/3fffa692-8228-4999-a504-c17482407872.png" width="142"/></div>
<p>The following image shows a blank <span class="packt_screen">Switch</span> step having an <span class="packt_screen">Apply to each</span> and a <span class="packt_screen">Do Until</span> step:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5f859f8a-c6a0-4d94-b885-9656aef72c7b.png"/></div>

<p>Microsoft Flow comes with prebuilt templates for Dynamics 365, such as Create Dynamics 365 leads from Excel Table, Notify your team about new opportunities, and so on. The following are some of the popular templates specific to Dynamics 365.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">For a full list of Dynamics 365 templates, go to the following link:<br/>

<p>The following table lists the different triggers available for Dynamics 365: </p>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="148" src="assets/f83960a3-8f74-4989-bb3a-6c9b891f13f9.jpg" width="490"/></div>
<p>At the time of writing this chapter (November 2017), Microsoft has also added two new triggers and four new actions for Dynamics 365 that are in the preview as version 2. These newer versions of triggers and actions will continue to get the latest features. Having a separate version helps to test new features without disrupting the existing flow that uses the existing version.</p>
<p>A new trigger has been added, which gets invoked for both the creation and the update of an entity's record. The newer version of both the trigger and action support option sets as user localized strings wherein the existing still works on integers as option set values.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>List of Actions that available for Dynamics 365:</span></p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="454" src="assets/5a975cf5-8b39-4b23-866e-e79b29406405.jpg" width="463"/></div>
<p>The following is the new Triggers and Actions that have been added to Dynamics 365:</p>
<p><strong>Triggers</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When a record is created (preview)</strong>: Triggers a flow when a record is created in Dynamics 365 with option sets exposed as strings</li>
<li><strong>When a record is created or updated (preview)</strong>: Triggers a flow when a record is created or updated in Dynamics 365 with option sets exposed as strings</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Actions</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Create a new record (preview)</strong>: Creates a new record for an entity with option sets exposed as strings</li>
<li><strong>Get record (preview):</strong> Retrieves the specific record for an entity with option sets exposed as strings</li>
<li><strong>List records (preview)</strong>: Retrieves records for an entity with option sets exposed as strings</li>
<li><strong>Update record (preview)</strong>: Updates an existing record for an entity with option sets exposed as strings</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">In Dynamics 365, we need to enable <span class="packt_screen">Change Tracking</span> for custom entities for Microsoft Flow to track any update to or deletion of that entity's record. By default, change tracking is enabled for OOB entities. For a custom entity, go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings | </span><span class="packt_screen">Customizations</span> | Open the <span class="packt_screen">Entity for Customization</span> | Check <span class="packt_screen">Change Tracking</span> checkbox in the <span class="packt_screen">Data Services</span> section in the <span class="packt_screen">General</span> tab.</div>

<p>We can create a flow from Microsoft Flow's home page (<a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/">https://flow.microsoft.com/</a>) or, inside Dynamics 365, we can go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Microsoft Flows</span> to create a flow.</p>
<p>We can also create a flow using the <span class="packt_screen">Create a flow</span> or <span class="packt_screen">See your flows</span> menu option from <span class="packt_screen">Flows</span> flyout menu on the ribbon, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="142" src="assets/554cb8cf-2ff0-4d40-86c4-f316320afabc.png" width="433"/></div>
<p>The following screenshot shows the new Flows menu added to Form's ribbon:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/fe64de8e-7fb5-49b6-bbf5-797e64a18d57.png"/></div>
<p>Let's implement a sample flow to see all the components in action.</p>
<p>We will be implementing the following scenario: </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario</strong>: On creation of a lead record in Dynamics 365 with Rating as High, add a new row with the details of the lead record in an Excel file inside OneDrive, create a follow-up task in Wunderlist, and finally send a notification in the Microsoft Flow mobile app.</li>
<li><strong>Trigger</strong>: When a lead record is created in Dynamics 365.</li>
<li><strong>Condition</strong>: If the value for Rating field is High in the lead record created.</li>
<li><strong>Action</strong>: Insert a row in Excel, create a task in Wunderlist, and send a notification.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="1">
<li>Go to the Microsoft Flow home page (<a href="https://flow.microsoft.com/">https://flow.microsoft.com/</a>), log in using your Microsoft account, go to <span class="packt_screen">My Flows</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Create from blank.</span></li>
<li>Specify the flow name and search for Dynamics 365 in the search box, which filters the list of triggers and actions specific to Dynamics 365. In the result, we need need to select the <span class="packt_screen">Dynamics 365- When a record is created</span> trigger:</li>
</ol>

<li>Search for the <kbd>Rating</kbd> field in the <span class="packt_screen">Dynamic content</span> tab's search box to add it to the condition. The <span class="packt_screen">Dynamic content</span> tab will list all the fields of the lead entity. The value for the Rating field will be fetched from the lead record created in Dynamics 365 when the flow executes, hence the term dynamic content. The dynamic content will basically hold the details of the newly created lead record at runtime when the flow executes:</li>

<p>In this section, we saw different templates, triggers, and actions specific to Dynamics 365. We also created a custom Dynamics 365 flow. In the next section, we will compare Flow with Dynamics 365 Workflow, which will help us to choose one over the other.</p>

<p>There are certain scenarios which can be implemented using either Dynamics Workflow or Microsoft Flow. Following are a few points we can consider when deciding.</p>
<p>If a scenario can be implemented within Dynamics 365 using Workflow, then Workflow is the better choice. This is because we can easily manage and monitor it from within CRM, through System Jobs. For managing and monitoring a flow, we need to go outside CRM and do the same from within Flow's portal.</p>
<p>Workflow can run both synchronously and asynchronously. Workflow will trigger immediately when conditions are met. So, in scenarios where we want immediate action to be taken, Workflow is a better choice. Moreover, Workflow is solution-aware, so it can move easily from one environment to another.</p>
<p>Microsoft Flow is a better fit in scenarios where we want to seamlessly integrate with third-party applications and services such as Twitter, Facebook, Yammer, and so on. To implement this within Workflow would require development effort, that is, writing a custom workflow activity.</p>
<p>With Workflow, we are restricted to email notifications; however, with Flow, we can send notifications in the form of SMS, push notifications to Flow's Mobile App, and email notifications from an account other than the Dynamics 365 User through Gmail, Hotmail, and so on, without writing a single line of code.</p>
<p>Microsoft Flow supports the approval scenario through approval specific actions, as shown in the following screenshot. An approval request can go to users other than Dynamics 365 Users:</p>

<p>Microsoft Flow has Dynamic 365, List records Action, which can be used to retrieve the records of an entity. We can use it to find a list of records of an entity matching a specific condition and can then act upon it. This can also be used to design a flow which either updates or deletes the child records when a parent record is updated or deleted. Normally, to implement such a scenario, we would have to write a custom workflow activity or plugin inside CRM. With Microsoft Flow, we can achieve this without writing a single line of code:</p>

<div class="packt_infobox">Deleting all the child records when a parent record is deleted in Dynamics 365 using Microsoft Flow: <a href="https://debajmecrm.com/2017/02/21/dynamics-crm-365-flows-using-microsoft-flows-generic-framework-to-delete-all-child-records-when-a-parent-record-is-deleted-in-dynamics-365/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://debajmecrm.com/2017/02/21/dynamics-crm-365-flows-using-microsoft-flows-generic-framework-to-delete-all-child-records-when-a-parent-record-is-deleted-in-dynamics-365/</span></a></div>
<p>In Dynamic Workflow, to implement schedule jobs we would end up using either wait or time out condition, which could impact on the performance of the system. On the other hand, Microsoft Flow supports the <span class="packt_screen">Recurrence</span> trigger, which can trigger an event to run at regular, customized time intervals:</p>

<p>In short, there are no clearly defined boundaries when it comes to choosing one over the other, as both have their own share of benefits and shortcomings.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we covered how Microsoft Flow can be used to write workflows that can seamlessly integrate with multiple applications and services, and without even a single line of code. We also had a detailed look at Microsoft Flow in the context of Dynamics 365 and learned how to write a simple flow that integrates multiple applications.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look at Web APIs and how we can consume them to create apps that integrate with Dynamics 365.</p>
