<em>Cheap branching and merging <a id="id453" class="indexterm"/> are the two most well known and applauded features of Git. In this chapter we shall see what branching is, why you need a branch, and when you need a branch. And since we have already tried our hand at merging, having used it to merge two files for solving a merge conflict in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Unleash the Beast – Git on Text-based Files">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Unleash the Beast – Git on Text-based Files</em>, we shall go one step ahead and see how to merge branches when needed.</em>
</p><p>All these are explored from an organization's point of view. We will also learn and practice methods to simplify our work by:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating simple alias for frequently used lengthy commands</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Chaining of multiple commands for frequently used workflows</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec71"/>What is branching</h1></div></div></div><p>Branching <a id="id454" class="indexterm"/> in Git is a function that is used to launch a separate, similar copy of the present workspace for different usage requirements. In other words branching means diverging from whatever you have been doing to a new lane where you can continue working on something else without disturbing your main line of work.</p><p>Let's understand it better with the help of the following example.</p><p>Suppose you are <a id="id455" class="indexterm"/> maintaining a checklist of some process for a department in your company, and having been impressed with how well it's structured, your superior requests you to share the checklist with another department after making some small changes specific to the department. How will you handle this situation?</p><p>An obvious way without a version control system is to save another copy of your file and make changes to the new one to fit the other department's needs. With a version control system and your current level of knowledge, perhaps you'd clone the repository and make changes to the cloned one, right?</p><p>Looking forward, <a id="id456" class="indexterm"/> there might be requirements/situations where you want to incorporate the changes that you have made to one of the copies with another one. For example, if you have discovered a typo in one copy, it's likely to be there in the other copy because both share the same source. Another thought – as your department evolves, you might realize that the customized version of the checklist that you created for the other department fits your department better than what you used to have earlier, so you want to integrate all changes made for the other department into your checklist and have a unified one.</p><p>This is the basic concept of a branch – a line of development which exists independent of another line both sharing a common history/source, which when needed can be integrated. Yes, a branch always begins life as a copy of something and from there begins a life of its own.</p><p>Almost all VCS have some form of support for such diverged workflows. But it's Git's speed and ease of execution that beats them all. This is the main reason why people refer to branching in Git as its killer feature (we'll cover the intricacies of Git branching in the next chapter).</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec72"/>Why do you need a branch</h1></div></div></div><p>To understand the <a id="id457" class="indexterm"/> why part, let's think about another situation where you are working in a team where different people contribute to different pieces existing in your project.</p><p>Your entire team recently launched phase one of your project and is working towards phase two. Unfortunately, a bug that was not identified by the quality control department in the earlier phases of testing the product pops up after the release of phase one (yeah, been there, faced that!).</p><p>All of a sudden your priority shifts to fixing the bug first, thereby dropping whatever you've been doing for phase two and quickly doing a hot fix for the identified bug in phase one. But switching context derails your line of work; a thought like that might prove very costly sometimes. To handle these kind of situations you have the branching concept (refer to the next section for visuals), which allows you to work on multiple things without stepping on each other's toes.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note26"/>Note</h3><p>There might be multiple branches inside a repository but there's only one active branch, which is also called current branch.</p><p>By default, since the <a id="id458" class="indexterm"/> inception of the repository, the branch named <strong>master</strong> <a id="id459" class="indexterm"/> is the active one and is the only branch unless and until changed explicitly.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec74"/>Naming conventions</h2></div></div></div><p>There are a bunch of <a id="id460" class="indexterm"/> naming conventions that Git enforces on its branch names; here's a list of frequently made mistakes:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A branch name cannot contain the following:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A space or a white space character</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Special characters such as colon (:), question mark (?), tilde (~), caret (^), asterisk (*), and open bracket ([)</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Forward slash (/) can be used to denote a hierarchical name, but the branch name cannot end with a slash<p>For example, my/name is allowed but myname/ is not allowed, and myname\ will wait for inputs to be concatenated</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Strings followed by a forward slash cannot begin with a dot (.)<p>For example, my/.name is not valid</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Names cannot contain two continuous dots (..) anywhere</li></ul></div></li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec73"/>When do you need a branch</h1></div></div></div><p>With Git, There are no hard and fast rules on when you can/need to create a branch. You can have your own technical, managerial, or even organizational reasons to do so. Following are a few to give you an idea:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A branch in <a id="id461" class="indexterm"/> development of software applications is often used for self learning/experimental purposes where the developer needs to try a piece of logic on the code without disturbing the actual released version of the application</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Situations like having a separate branch of source code for each customer who requires a separate set of improvements to your present package</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">And the classic one – few people in the team might be working on the bug fixes of the released version, whereas the others might be working on the next phase/release</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For few <a id="id462" class="indexterm"/> workflows, you can even have separate branches for people providing their inputs, which are finally integrated to produce a release candidate</li></ul></div><p>Following are flow diagrams for few workflows <a id="id463" class="indexterm"/> to help us understand the utilization of branching:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Branching for a bug fix can have a structure as shown the following diagram:<div><img src="img/7522OS_07_01.jpg" alt="When do you need a branch"/></div><p>This explains that when you are working on P2 and find a bug in P1, you need not drop your work, but switch to P1, fix it, and return back to P2.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Branching for each promotion is as shown in the following diagram:<div><img src="img/7522OS_07_02.jpg" alt="When do you need a branch"/></div><p>This explains how <a id="id464" class="indexterm"/> the same set of files can be managed across different phases/promotions. Here, P1 from development has been sent to the testing team (a branch called testing will be given to the testing team) and the bugs found are reported and fixed in the development branch (v1.1 and v1.2) and merged with the testing branch. This is then branched as production or release, which end users can access.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Branching for each component development is as shown in the following diagram:<div><img src="img/7522OS_07_03.jpg" alt="When do you need a branch"/></div><p>Here every <a id="id465" class="indexterm"/> development task/component build is a new independent branch, which when completed is merged into the main development branch.</p></li></ul></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec74"/>Practice makes perfect: branching with Git</h1></div></div></div><p>I'm sure you have got a good idea about what, why, and when you can use branches when dealing with a Git repository. Let's fortify the understanding by creating a few use cases.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec75"/>Scenario</h2></div></div></div><p>Suppose you are the <a id="id466" class="indexterm"/> training organizer in your organization and are responsible for conducting trainings as and when needed. You are preparing a list of people who you think might need business communication skills training based on their previous records.</p><p>As a first step, you need to send an e-mail to the nominations and check their availability on the specified date, and then get approval from their respective managers to allot the resource. Having experience in doing this, you are aware that the names picked by you from the records for training can have changes even at the last minute based on situations within the team. So you want to send out the initial list for each team and then proceed with your work <a id="id467" class="indexterm"/> while the list gets finalized.</p></div></div>

<em>What just happened?</em>
</h2></div></div></div><p>Without any loss of thought or data, we have successfully adopted the changes on the first list, which came in while working on the second list, with the concept of branching – without one interfering with another.</p><p>As discussed, a <a id="id476" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id477" class="indexterm"/> branch begins its life as a copy of something else and then has a life of its own.</p><p>Here, by performing <code class="literal">git checkout</code> <code class="literal">–b branch_name</code> we have created a new branch from the existing position.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note27"/>Note</h3><p>Technically, the so-called existing position is termed as the position of HEAD and this type of lightweight branches, which we create locally, are called topic branches. Another type of branch would be the remote branch or remote-tracking branch, which tracks somebody else's work from some other repository. We already got exposed to this while learning the concept of cloning.</p></div></div><p>The command <code class="literal">git checkout –b branch_name</code> is equivalent to executing the following two commands:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">git branch branch_name</code>: Creates a new branch of the given name at the given position, but stays in the current branch</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><code class="literal">git checkout branch_name</code>: Switches you to the specified branch from the current/active branch</li></ul></div><p>When a branch is created using Git Gui, the checkout process is automatically taken care of, which results in it being in the created branch.</p><p>The command <code class="literal">git merge</code> <code class="literal">branch_name</code> merges the current/active branch with the specified branch to incorporate the content. Note that even after the merge the branch will exist until it's deleted with the command <code class="literal">git branch –d branch_name</code>.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note28"/>Note</h3><p>In cases where you have created and played with a branch whose content you don't want to merge with any other branch and want to simply delete the entire branch, use <code class="literal">–D</code> instead of <code class="literal">–d</code> in the command mentioned earlier.</p></div></div><p>To view a list of branches available in the system, use the command git branch as shown in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/7522_07_06.jpg" alt="What just happened?"/></div><p>As shown in the <a id="id478" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id479" class="indexterm"/> screenshot, the branches available in our <code class="literal">BCT</code> repository right now are <strong>marketing</strong> and <strong>master</strong>, with <a id="id480" class="indexterm"/> 
<strong>master</strong> being the <em>default branch</em> when you create a repository. The branch with a star in front of it is the active branch. To ease the process of identifying the active branch, Git displays the active branch in brackets (<code class="literal">branch_name</code>) as indicated with an arrow.</p><p>By performing this exercise we have learned to create, add content, and merge branches when needed. Now, to visually see how the history has shaped up, open gitk (by typing <code class="literal">gitk</code> in the command-line interface or by selecting <strong>Visualize All Branch History</strong> from the <strong>Repository</strong> menu of Git Gui) and view the top left corner. It will show a history like in the following screenshot:</p><div><img src="img/7522_07_07.jpg" alt="What just happened?"/></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip05"/>Tip</h3><p>

To verify this, switch back to your command-line window and type the command <code class="literal">git st</code> and observe the output, which will be a spot on match to your <code class="literal">git status</code> command <a id="id484" class="indexterm"/> . Similarly we can use <code class="literal">git ad</code> as a substitute for the <a id="id485" class="indexterm"/> <code class="literal">git add</code> command.</p><p>We can also chain two or more commands with one single alias.

 <a id="id490" class="indexterm"/> chained multiple commands under a single alias.</p><p>From now on, whenever we need to create a branch inside this repository, we can do it by using the <a id="id491" class="indexterm"/> <code class="literal">Git bco</code> command.</p><p>Similarly whenever you need to add all the changes and view the status of the repository in series, we can use the following command:</p><div><pre class="programlisting">

</pre></div><p>Notice the difference between adding an alias through the command line and our recent modification directly on the file.

<code class="literal">git add .</code> adds all the <a id="id492" class="indexterm"/> changes made to the files present in your repository whereas the <code class="literal">&amp;&amp;</code> symbol is used to join another command, namely <code class="literal">git st</code> with the previous one. <code class="literal">Git st</code> displays the status of the repository.

<code class="literal">${1}</code> is a magic object technically called a variable which does the job of fetching the user values (<code class="literal">check_branch</code>) and inserting them next to the command dynamically, such that wherever you use <code class="literal">${1}</code>, it's <a id="id493" class="indexterm"/> 
 <a id="id494" class="indexterm"/> filled with the value that was provided by the user.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note29"/>Note</h3><p>Note that all the configuration changes that we have made are with respect to the <code class="literal">.config</code> file of one particular repository only and hence all these customizations will stay local.

</p><p>Create a simple alias for <code class="literal">git log</code>.</p><p>Then, create a chain with two commands and call it <code class="literal">clog</code> (<code class="literal">git commit</code> and <code class="literal">git log)</code> in such a way that when you type <code class="literal">git clog "my_commit_message_here"</code>, your changes will shift from the <strong>changes to be committed</strong> state to <strong>nothing to commit</strong> state (which means the changes that were added but not committed are now committed with the commit message provided) continued by a listing of all the commits and their relevant details (which are usually displayed when using the command <code class="literal">git log</code>).</p></div></div></div></div>
