    to note that your security-related work here is more accessible compared to the
    Server and Data Center versions. However, this does not mean that you are 100%
    secure. You should put in a lot of effort to keep the environment safe. In this
    chapter, we will give numerous security-related tips and a short yet practical
    guide to keep your Confluence environment much safer.

    such as ISO27001, SOC2, and GDPR, align with Atlassian Trust Center. As Confluence

    apps you decide to trust. Your responsibility also includes the compliant utilization

    organization. This verification and user claims enable centralized handling of
    all Atlassian accounts for employees and enforcement of authentication rules (such

    users within that domain who already have Atlassian accounts get claimed. New
    sign-ups in that domain will know they are receiving a supervised account.

    You must, however, exercise caution in authorizing access to your information

    users from executing actions allowed by those permissions, even if you don’t sanction
    such actions. Some products permit you to give public anonymous access to your
    data. If you authorize this access, you may lose control over further distribution
    or copying of that information.
