<h1 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Integrating and Extending Confluence</h1>
<p>Confluence is a powerful tool, and one of the features that enhances its strength is the ability to expand its capabilities quickly and reliably. You can do this in two ways: either integrate Confluence with other systems you use or add new features to Confluence. In this chapter, we will talk about these integrations and extension possibilities to give you an idea of Confluence’s potential in these areas. Some integrations in the following pages can be activated when you start using Confluence, while others may require effort. We can comfortably say that Atlassian has done its part regarding integration. As a result, you will find that Confluence is ready with world-standard infrastructure when you need integration. You may not need integration or expansion, but knowing how to do so will surely broaden your horizons. So, let’s examine Confluence’s integration and extension capabilities.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration with Atlassian tools</li>
<li>Integration with non-Atlassian tools</li>
<li>Extending Confluence</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-317"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Integration with Atlassian tools</h1>
<p>Confluence’s seamless integration <a id="_idIndexMarker901"/>with other Atlassian Cloud products is a standout <a id="_idIndexMarker902"/>feature that amplifies its capabilities and accessibility. These integrations are ready from the moment you begin using Confluence. In most cases, completing the integration is as simple as clicking a few buttons, eliminating any complex setup or technical hurdles. This way, it’s easier to foster a harmonious ecosystem where all Atlassian tools can interact, streamline workflows, and improve collaboration across teams and projects. Here, we will dive deeper into the integrations with Atlassian products and explore how they can provide a cohesive, efficient, and intuitive experience tailored to your organization’s specific needs and objectives.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Using Confluence and Jira Software together</h2>
<p>You can easily integrate <a id="_idIndexMarker903"/>Confluence with Jira Software. Let’s look <a id="_idIndexMarker904"/>at what you can accomplish by using these two <a id="_idIndexMarker905"/>applications together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use embedded Confluence pages in Jira.</li>
<li>Connect your Jira project to a Confluence space to manage Confluence pages without having to leave the product, eliminating context-switching and creating a more integrated experience. You can even edit within Jira using embedded pages.</li>
<li>Create Jira issues from Confluence.</li>
<li>Track Jira issues from Confluence. Many people don’t want to spend time constantly switching between applications. Fortunately, the integration between Jira and Confluence simplifies tracking Jira issues directly in Confluence. Whether you spend most of your day in Confluence or Jira, you have the context and traceability you need, which translates to increased efficiency for your team.</li>
<li>Dynamically list Jira issues on a Confluence page.</li>
<li>Create Jira Reports in Confluence Cloud.</li>
<li>Facilitate issue creation by inserting an issue collector on your Confluence page. The Jira issue collector is excellent for gathering customer feedback, allowing your organization to log errors or issues, or perhaps making it faster and simpler for those working in Confluence to create tickets in Jira without disrupting their workflow.</li>
<li>Embed a real-time roadmap from Jira on your Confluence page. You can find everything in one place<a id="_idIndexMarker906"/> without switching between applications or manually copying <a id="_idIndexMarker907"/>and pasting <a id="_idIndexMarker908"/>content.</li>
</ul>
<p>After seeing the use of Confluence with Jira Software, it's now time to explore its use with Jira Service Management.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Using Confluence and Jira Service Management together</h2>
<p>Integrating Confluence and <strong class="bold">Jira Service Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">JSM</strong>) combines two powerful platforms, creating a dynamic environment that enhances productivity and collaboration. By connecting<a id="_idIndexMarker909"/> Confluence’s extensive documentation capabilities with JSM’s robust service management, teams can work <a id="_idIndexMarker910"/>more efficiently, make informed <a id="_idIndexMarker911"/>decisions faster, and provide superior customer service. The following list highlights this integration’s key benefits and features, demonstrating how it can be a game-changer for organizations looking to streamline their processes and foster a more cohesive working environment:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Better information sharing</strong>: Confluence pages can easily be linked with JSM requests and projects, allowing all team members to have easy access to the needed information.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Enhanced collaboration</strong>: Project team members can collaborate on documentation, drafts, and other materials, advancing projects more efficiently.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Real-time updates</strong>: Status updates on tasks in JSM can be directly reflected on Confluence pages, giving everyone access to the latest information.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Central repository</strong>: Confluence can serve as a central repository where you can gather all documents and information related to projects, providing quicker access to sought-after information.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Faster decision-making</strong>: All the necessary information and context can be easily shared between JSM and Confluence, speeding up the decision-making and approval processes.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Customer support</strong>: Customer service teams can provide more effective support by leveraging the knowledge base stored in Confluence, increasing customer satisfaction.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Advanced reporting</strong>: Data from JSM can be used within Confluence for in-depth analysis and reporting.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Reusable content</strong>: Standard templates <a id="_idIndexMarker912"/>and pages can be reused across projects and teams to streamline different processes.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Knowledge base integration</strong>: The customer portal you’ve implemented with JSM can perform as a knowledge base<a id="_idIndexMarker913"/> when integrated with Confluence, helping your customers<a id="_idIndexMarker914"/> find frequently asked questions and resolve their issues more rapidly and independently. This can also reduce your support team’s workload and enhance customer experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, bringing together the strengths of both Confluence and JSM can increase efficiency, collaboration, accessibility, and scalability for your business.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-320"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Using Confluence and Trello together</h2>
<p>In a dynamic and collaborative <a id="_idIndexMarker915"/>work setting, tools that facilitate team communication, planning, and execution are essential. Meanwhile, Confluence and<a id="_idIndexMarker916"/> Trello stand out with their distinct yet <a id="_idIndexMarker917"/>complementary features. Now, let’s explore how these two platforms integrate and uncover their user-friendly nature, security measures, and advantages, along with illustrative examples.</p>
<p>Integrating Confluence with Trello is neither complicated nor time-consuming; it’s a matter of copying and pasting Trello card URLs into Confluence, embedding fully interactive Trello boards, or utilizing Confluence Power-Up for Trello. This way, team members can easily switch between envisioning in Confluence and actioning in Trello. Security concerns are also addressed as Trello respects and enforces permissions and access controls.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the benefits of using Confluence and Trello together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both Trello and Confluence are <a id="_idIndexMarker918"/>designed for collaboration. Their integration allows teams to visualize more significant stories, plan, and work on detailed tasks.</li>
<li>Any changes made in either platform are immediately visible in the other, enabling timely communication and responsiveness.</li>
<li>Confluence provides the blueprint, while Trello helps in organizing and actioning tasks. Together, they systematically ensure that ideas are transformed into reality.</li>
<li>Content access is carefully controlled. If you don’t have permission to view specific content, a note will alert <a id="_idIndexMarker919"/>you accordingly, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected.</li>
<li>Embedding different <a id="_idIndexMarker920"/>Trello boards onto a single Confluence page can give an overview of various teams or projects, enhancing management oversight.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are some integration examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Embedding Trello cards or boards in Confluence</strong>: Confluence acts as a repository for your vision and plans, and Trello cards can be integrated to provide actionable tasks</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Interactive Trello boards in Confluence</strong>: Fully functional Trello boards can be displayed within Confluence, offering all the features available in Trello itself</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Linking Trello with Confluence pages</strong>: Reverse integration is also possible, allowing Confluence pages to be attached to Trello cards, aiding in smooth navigation between the two platforms</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Brainstorming and sharing ideas</strong>: You can detail a problem in Confluence and use Trello for brainstorming and innovative problem-solving</li>
</ul>
<p>Integrating Confluence and Trello is easy and secure; it also offers a comprehensive platform for teams to plan, collaborate, and execute. This integration amplifies the strengths of both tools and enables a smoother workflow that can adapt to various project requirements. Whether used for daily task management or complex project planning, this integration bridges the <a id="_idIndexMarker921"/>gap between ideation and <a id="_idIndexMarker922"/>execution.</p>
<p>Up to this point, we’ve<a id="_idIndexMarker923"/> seen how Confluence can be integrated with other Atlassian tools, such as Jira and Trello. Now, we want to discuss the integration of Confluence with other systems.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-321"><a id="_idTextAnchor322"/>Integration with non-Atlassian tools</h1>
<p>Confluence can securely exchange<a id="_idIndexMarker924"/> information with many different systems that are not developed by Atlassian. Some have native integration with Confluence, while others can be solved with applications on the Atlassian Marketplace. For some systems, Confluence’s Smart Link support is the solution. It is also possible to create your own integrations using the Confluence Cloud API.</p>
<p>At the end of this section, we will suggest questions to guide you on integration. Once you’ve answered these questions, you will have a solid insight into integrating Confluence with your chosen application. Now, let’s take a look at the most popular applications that are used with Confluence.</p>

<li>Easily like and engage with Confluence pages without switching platforms</li>
<li>Customize notifications to individual or team channels, ensuring the right people get the information at the right time</li>
</ul>
<p>The integration of Confluence and Slack brings collaboration to a new level. With straightforward implementation, there is no extra cost for the basic features or powerful security measures. Whether for <a id="_idIndexMarker934"/>project management, content creation, or simply keeping everyone on the same page, the Confluence-Slack integration offers tangible benefits so that you can adapt to various needs and preferences.</p>
<p>The following screenshot <a id="_idIndexMarker935"/>shows the page of Atlassian’s official Confluence Cloud for Slack app:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_13_01_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.1 – The Confluence Cloud for Slack application</p>
<p>As you can see, the Confluence<a id="_idIndexMarker936"/> Cloud for Slack app is free. By installing this app, you can securely facilitate communication between Confluence and Slack.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-324"><a id="_idTextAnchor325"/>Smart Links</h2>
<p>Confluence’s Smart Links offer <a id="_idIndexMarker937"/>an intuitive solution that fosters productivity and efficient collaboration. Smart Links are more than just hyperlinks; they<a id="_idIndexMarker938"/> provide a more prosperous way to share content across various applications by transforming traditional links into interactive previews or information-rich cards. Whether it’s a Google Drive document, a Jira issue, or a Trello card, Smart Links offer a glimpse of the content without you having to leave Confluence. Let's look at what Smart Links offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Enhance collaboration</strong>: By offering previews, team <a id="_idIndexMarker939"/>members can engage with the content more effectively</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Save time</strong>: There’s no need to navigate away from Confluence; the vital information is presented within the platform</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Create a cohesive experience</strong>: A unified view across different applications makes information handling more intuitive</li>
</ul>
<p>Using Smart Links is as simple as pasting the URL of the content into a Confluence page. Confluence automatically transforms<a id="_idIndexMarker940"/> it into a Smart Link, presenting a preview or detailed information card. Follow these steps to experiment with a Smart Link:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Copy the URL</strong>: Copy the URL of the content you want to share.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Paste in Confluence</strong>: Paste the URL into your Confluence page – it’ll be automatically converted into a Smart Link.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Enjoy the preview</strong>: Hover over the link or view the detailed card to see the content preview.</li>
</ol>
<p>The continuous improvements to the Smart Links feature ensure compatibility with an expanding list of platforms, further enhancing its versatility. Smart Links are supported for various popular applications and platforms, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google Drive</li>
<li>Microsoft Office</li>

<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Dropbox</li>
<li>Box</li>
<li>Asana</li>
<li>GitHub</li>
<li>GitLab</li>
<li>Figma</li>
<li>Adobe XD</li>
<li>Miro</li>
<li>Zeplin</li>
<li>Invision</li>
</ul>
<p>As safety is a paramount concern when sharing links across platforms, Confluence’s Smart Links are designed with security concerns, ensuring only authorized users can access the linked content and the permissions are respected. Confluence’s Smart Links foster an environment <a id="_idIndexMarker941"/>where information flows freely, securely, and efficiently across different applications. By transcending the barriers between platforms, they create a unified workspace where teams <a id="_idIndexMarker942"/>can interact with content effortlessly.</p>
<p>In a world driven by information, the ability to share, preview, and interact with content across various platforms within a single interface is not a luxury, but a necessity. Confluence’s Smart Links fulfill this need, paving the way for a richer, more intelligent, and more productive collaboration experience.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-325"><a id="_idTextAnchor326"/>Using Confluence with other tools</h2>
<p>As our space here is limited, we have only talked about the most popular applications. After careful research, you will see that <a id="_idIndexMarker943"/>Confluence can integrate with many applications other than those mentioned in this book. When investigating whether an application can be used with Confluence, we suggest asking these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does Confluence integrate natively with my chosen application?</li>
<li>Does Confluence provide Smart Link support for my chosen application?</li>
<li>Is there a Confluence app for my selected application on the Atlassian Marketplace?</li>
<li>Can I integrate Confluence with my chosen application using the Confluence Cloud API?</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we have provided <a id="_idIndexMarker944"/>sufficient information on integration, it’s time to talk about Extending Confluence.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-326"><a id="_idTextAnchor327"/>Extending Confluence</h1>
<p>If the fundamental features of Confluence do not meet your needs, don’t worry – you still have options. First, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker945"/>enhance Confluence by adding extra functionalities by installing apps from the Atlassian Marketplace. Alternatively, you can either develop your applications or commission them to be built by others. Now, let’s delve deeper and explore how these strategies work.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-327"><a id="_idTextAnchor328"/>Installing applications via the Atlassian Marketplace</h2>
<p>The Atlassian Marketplace offers many <a id="_idIndexMarker946"/>applications for Confluence that you can review, try, and purchase. Similar to Confluence licenses, you can easily access these applications through a monthly or yearly subscription. In the following screenshot, you can see the welcome screen of the Atlassian Marketplace, which<a id="_idIndexMarker947"/> you can access from <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com">https://marketplace.atlassian.com</a>:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_13_02_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.2 – The Atlassian Marketplace</p>
<p>As you can see, there is a<a id="_idIndexMarker948"/> search bar at the very top of the screen for you to search for applications. You can browse applications on the Atlassian Marketplace with it.</p>
<p>Regarding the following screenshot, please examine the panel on the left-hand side of the screen:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_13_03_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.3 – Using filters on the Atlassian Marketplace</p>
<p>In the <strong class="bold">Show apps for</strong> section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker949"/>want you to change two settings:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, select <strong class="bold">Confluence</strong> in the first drop-down list. By doing this, you are specifying to the search engine that you are only looking for Confluence plugins. It’s worth noting that there are also applications for other Atlassian products besides Confluence on the marketplace.</li>
<li>Then, we want you to select the <strong class="bold">Cloud</strong> option in the second drop-down list. By doing this, you are specifying to the search engine that you are only looking for applications that work in the Cloud edition. It’s worth mentioning that there are also applications for other editions such as Server and Data Center on the marketplace. Note that Confluence Server is officially decommissioned and will not be supported after February 2024.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to refine your search further, you can use filters. At the time of writing, there are five different filters available on the Atlassian Marketplace:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Cloud </strong><strong class="bold">Fortified apps</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Partner supported</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Free for </strong><strong class="bold">all teams</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Beta version</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Free up to </strong><strong class="bold">10 users</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We won’t go over all the filters as we think the filter names are highly self-explanatory, but we would like to give you two<a id="_idIndexMarker950"/> tips here:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you’re after the highest possible level of information security, you can use the <strong class="bold">Cloud Fortified </strong><strong class="bold">apps</strong> filter</li>
<li>If you’re looking for applications that are supported by an official Atlassian partner, you can use the <strong class="bold">Partner </strong><strong class="bold">supported</strong> filter</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also classify applications using application categories.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the introduction screen for Gliffy Diagrams for Confluence, one of the most popular Confluence applications on the Atlassian Marketplace. Let’s examine this screen:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_13_04_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.4 – A Confluence app on the Atlassian Marketplace</p>
<p>As you can see, every application <a id="_idIndexMarker951"/>on the Atlassian Marketplace has a detailed introduction page. Atlassian expects all companies that develop applications for the Marketplace to fill out this page thoroughly and transparently. With this introduction screen, you can access the basic information about an application. On this page, you can find the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Overview</strong>: The standout features and screenshots related to the application</li>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.7 – Manage apps</p>
<p>In this interface, you can see all the details about the app Gliffy Diagrams right in your Confluence space, without going to the Atlassian Marketplace. In it, you can access almost all the information on the Atlassian Marketplace and details such as license information. You can also end the trial <a id="_idIndexMarker955"/>period or remove the application from the system through this interface. Also, note that you need Confluence Administrator permission to install applications and access the application management screen.</p>
<p>The application you installed is now accessible by users on Confluence. You can access all the installed applications using the <strong class="bold">Apps</strong> button in the top menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 13.8 – The Confluence Apps menu</p>
<p>Here, you can access all applications installed on Confluence (including apps developed by Atlassian, such as <a id="_idIndexMarker956"/>Calendars and Analytics) through this menu. In it, you can find new applications, manage your existing applications, or manage application requests from users. Note that different levels of users will see different options under this menu. For example, the <strong class="bold">Find new apps</strong>, <strong class="bold">Manage apps</strong>, and <strong class="bold">View app requests</strong> options will only be visible to users with Confluence Administrator permissions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-328"><a id="_idTextAnchor329"/>Developing an app</h2>
<p>If the features of Confluence<a id="_idIndexMarker957"/> and the plugins you have installed are not enough for you, there is another path you can take: developing an app. You can develop an application within your company or seek support from a competent Atlassian Solution Partner such as Ponsatlas. App development is a highly detailed subject and could fill a book on its own. In this section, we’d like to provide a<a id="_idIndexMarker958"/> comprehensive summary of the app development needs of your remote working team.</p>

<h3>In-house development versus outsourcing – a comparative analysis for Confluence Cloud applications</h3>
<p>In a competitive business <a id="_idIndexMarker961"/>environment, choosing the right approach for software development is a critical decision. Organizations leveraging platforms such as Confluence Cloud often face the dilemma of developing applications in-house or outsourcing them to specialized firms such as Atlassian Solution Partners. Both approaches offer distinct benefits and challenges, and the choice can significantly impact factors such as cost, control, time-to-market, and alignment with business goals.</p>
<p>Here, we’d like to compare in-house development and outsourcing for Confluence Cloud applications so that you can make informed decisions that align with your specific needs, resources, and strategic objectives. Whether you’re prioritizing customization, cost efficiency, or expertise, understanding the two development paths can guide you in selecting the option that best fits your business.</p>
<p>Here are the advantages of in-house development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Control</strong>: In-house development provides more control at every stage of the project. Customizations and changes can be made more quickly and directly</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Privacy</strong>: In-house development can help protect sensitive data and business processes without the need to share them with third-party firms</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Team alignment</strong>: Your in-house team<a id="_idIndexMarker962"/> may already have a strong sense of company culture, which can<a id="_idIndexMarker963"/> enhance collaboration and efficiency</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are the disadvantages of in-house development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Cost</strong>: Developing in-house expertise and providing necessary resources can increase initial costs</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Time</strong>: The training and development process may take longer if the necessary skills and talent are absent within the company</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s look at the advantages<a id="_idIndexMarker964"/> of outsourcing to an external firm (for example, an Atlassian Solution Partner):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Expertise</strong>: A specialist firm, such as an Atlassian Solution Partner, might have specific skills and experience to assist in completing the project more quickly and effectively</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cost-effectiveness</strong>: Outsourcing can save on the costs associated with forming and training an in-house team</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Focus</strong>: You can direct your in-house resources toward your core business, leaving the application development to an external firm</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s look at the disadvantages of <a id="_idIndexMarker965"/>outsourcing to an external firm (for example, an Atlassian Solution Partner):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Less control</strong>: Working with a third-party firm may provide less control at certain project stages</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Privacy concerns</strong>: Sharing sensitive information may lead to privacy and security <a id="_idIndexMarker966"/>concerns</li>
</ul>
<p>In sum, the path you’ll choose may vary, depending on your company’s objectives, budget, timeline, and existing internal resources. In-house development may be better when more control and customization are desired, while outsourcing to an external firm may be suitable when a <a id="_idIndexMarker967"/>quicker and perhaps more cost-effective solution is a priority. Understanding that both approaches have unique advantages and disadvantages will help you make the most suitable choice.</p>
<h3>Developing a Confluence Cloud application – key considerations</h3>
<p>Confluence Cloud is a robust <a id="_idIndexMarker968"/>platform for collaborative software solutions, enabling teams to work together more efficiently and creatively. However, developing a new application for Confluence Cloud is a multifaceted job that requires a deep understanding of various aspects. From aligning with Atlassian’s familiar user experience to ensuring optimal performance, security, and design, each element plays a vital role in the application’s success. Also, considerations such as agility, a comprehensive review of Atlassian’s roadmap, mastery of existing plugins, and sustainability further enrich the development process. In this section, we’ll concentrate on these critical considerations, providing insight and guidelines to navigate the complex landscape of Confluence Cloud application development.</p>
<p>When developing a Confluence Cloud application, it’s essential to stay aligned with the familiar <strong class="bold">user experience</strong> (<strong class="bold">UX</strong>) that we <a id="_idIndexMarker969"/>associate with Atlassian. A consistent UX ensures that users find the new application intuitive and easy to use, maintaining a seamless experience across the platform. It is also important to pay attention to layout, navigation, visual elements, and interactions. By adhering to Atlassian’s design guidelines and UX principles, developers can create an application that feels like a natural extension of the existing ecosystem.</p>
<p>Performance optimization is another crucial aspect to consider. An application that takes a long time to load or becomes unresponsive can significantly affect user satisfaction and productivity. That’s why it’s crucial to prioritize efficient coding practices, optimized queries, and effective resource management. Regular performance testing and monitoring will also help identify bottlenecks and ensure the application runs smoothly, even under heavy loads or large datasets.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, security should be a top priority. Pay attention to the best practices in authentication, authorization, data encryption, and secure communication. Regular vulnerability assessments and adherence to industry security standards will also help protect sensitive data and maintain users’ trust. Collaborating with security experts and staying updated on the latest security trends is another option to build a secure application.</p>
<p>An elegant and functional design not only enhances the visual appeal but also contributes to the overall usability of the application. For a refined and engaging user interface, consider employing user-centered design principles, engaging in iterative design processes, and seeking user feedback. Design considerations should also extend to accessibility, ensuring that the application is accessible by as many people as possible, regardless of any disabilities <a id="_idIndexMarker970"/>or limitations they may have. The Agile approach to development emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, and responsiveness to change. Regular reviews, iterations, and close collaboration between stakeholders ensure that the development process aligns with the evolving needs of users and the organization.</p>
<p>When developing a new application, another point to focus on is understanding Atlassian’s roadmap and strategic direction to stay aligned with Atlassian’s long-term goals and upcoming features. By studying the roadmap, developers can avoid duplicating efforts and identify opportunities for integration or enhancement within the broader ecosystem.</p>
<p>Also, being well-versed in existing plugins is essential as another developer may have already created the application you plan to develop. Researching existing solutions, understanding the strengths and weaknesses, and identifying gaps or unmet needs can guide development efforts. Building on existing plugins or collaborating with other developers can also lead to more efficient and innovative solutions.</p>
<p>Sustainability in development is not just about the immediate product – it also considers the application’s long-term maintenance, scalability, and extensibility. Ensuring the code is well-documented, following best practices in architecture and development, and planning for ongoing support and updates will contribute to a more sustainable and resilient application.</p>
<p>In conclusion, developing a new Confluence Cloud application is a complex task that requires a thoughtful approach to various aspects, including user experience, performance, security, design, agility, alignment with Atlassian’s roadmap, mastery of existing plugins, and sustainability. By adopting a comprehensive approach to these elements, you can create a robust, user-friendly, and valuable addition to the Confluence Cloud ecosystem.</p>
