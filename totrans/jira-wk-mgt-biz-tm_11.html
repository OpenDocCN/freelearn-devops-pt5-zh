		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Chapter 8</em>: Configuring Permissions and Simple Administration</h1>
			<p>Now that we have our project up and running and have added new custom fields to provide more insight into our issues, we need to be able to share access to the project and the issues. This will include creating or inviting new users and placing them in the appropriate groups. You can then assign project permissions to the user based on their user account or the group in which they reside.</p>
			<p>This chapter covers the nuances of configuring permissions for both free and paid accounts and how to apply additional security within the project. Then, we will cap it off with a brief discussion of some simple project administration functions that we have not learned yet.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Jira Work Management</strong> approaches permissions and access to the information differently based on whether your account is a free account or a paid one. Also, we will see some slight differences in simple project administration based on free and paid accounts and what is available to manage at the higher system or global level for Jira.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adding users and creating groups</li>
				<li>Project roles and permission</li>
				<li>Configuring the permission scheme</li>
				<li>Applying issue-level security</li>
				<li>JWM project administrator capabilities</li>
				<li>Jira administrators versus project administrators</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the completion of this chapter, you will learn how to invite new users and add project roles and users to the roles. Once those are in place, you will be able to access and modify the <strong class="bold">Permission Scheme</strong> to use those roles and users, and then learn how to create and apply issue security levels.</p>
			<p>To be able to manage your project more fully, you will learn the capabilities available to project administrators and the differences between Jira administrator and project administrator permissions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As Jira Work Management is only available in the Jira Cloud environment, the requirement for this chapter is simple: <em class="italic">access to a Jira Cloud environment</em>.</p>
			<p>Atlassian provides a free Jira Work Management account for up to 10 users. You can create your account by going to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free">https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free</a> and following the instructions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>User management</h1>
			<p>When you<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> first set up a new instance/site for Jira – in this case, a new instance of Jira Work Management – the email address used during the signup will create a user that is a Jira administrator, an organization administrator, and a site administrator. A very brief description of each follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Jira administrator</strong>: The Jira Administrator<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> can make all changes at the system and project level within your Jira instance for the products the user has been<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> granted access to. These are often referred to as <strong class="bold">global permissions</strong>. However, they cannot grant access to users to join your instance.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organization administrator</strong>: When <a id="_idIndexMarker410"/>you create a new instance/site, an organization is automatically created as well. Initially, it will be named the same as your site. The organization administrator will be able to add other organization administrators, create system-level <strong class="bold">API keys</strong>, verify <strong class="bold">domains</strong> for your site, implement <strong class="bold">Atlassian Access</strong>, and control the <strong class="bold">directory</strong> of managed users for your domain.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Site administrator</strong>: The site administrator<a id="_idIndexMarker411"/> can grant users access to products in your instance by inviting them to the instance. Consequently, they can also deactivate user access to the products. They can also create <strong class="bold">groups</strong> and assign users to those groups.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To access the <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>user management function of Jira, you must be a site administrator. You can only become a site administrator by being granted that permission by another site administrator. To make a user a site administrator, you simply place that user in the <strong class="bold">site-admin</strong> group under <strong class="bold">User management</strong>.</p>
			<p>To gain access to the user management function, click on the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> gear icon in the top navigation bar and select <strong class="bold">User management</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.1</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.1_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1 – User management&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1 – User management</p>
			<p>The result will bring you to a list of current users at the bottom of the screen and a section at the top of the screen where you can invite new users. As seen in <em class="italic">Figure 8.2</em>, there are two different ways to initially invite a user.</p>
			<p>One option is to simply begin adding the email addresses of the invitees in the center section of the display with one email address per box. The invitees will get an email that will be needed to verify the account and accept the invitation. You cannot create accounts for users without the email being validated by the recipient of the email address. To send the emails, click on the <strong class="bold">Invite team members</strong> button at the bottom of the section:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.2_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.2 – Invite users&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2 – Invite users</p>
			<p>The second way to <a id="_idIndexMarker413"/>invite users begins by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Invite users</strong> button at the top of the screen. This will open the dialog box seen in <em class="italic">Figure 8.3</em>.</p>
			<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>option gives you more flexibility as to which groups and permissions you can automatically assign to the user when the invitation is accepted. Just enter the email address of the future user, choose the role and products the user can access, and include any groups.</p>
			<p>You can pick from one of three roles. The following descriptions will be displayed for each role on the screen:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Basic</strong>: Can access the products you specify only</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Trusted</strong>: Can update product settings, add new products, and invite basic users to products</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Site Administrator</strong>: Can administer your site, determine user access, and update billing details (like you)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><em class="italic">Figure 8.3</em> shows how to invite new users to your instance. You can invite one user or multiple ones:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.3_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.3 – User information&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.3 – User information</p>
			<p>If you <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>have not created any additional groups yet (we will do that later in this section), your initial options for adding groups will be:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">jira-software-users</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker416"/>the most basic level of access needed to perform functions in Jira Work Management. Users will have no product access without being in this group.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">jira-administrators</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>grants the user the ability to administer the features within your Jira instance, such as screens, custom fields, issue types, and workflows.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">site-admins</strong>: As <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>mentioned above, this grants the user the ability to add/remove other users and create groups and maintain their memberships.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Administrators</strong>: This is basically <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>a combination of the jira-administrators and site-admins roles, giving the user full access to the system. This is sometimes referred to as a <em class="italic">super user</em>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you have added an email address (or more), a statement will appear, as shown previously in <em class="italic">Figure 8.3</em>, that states, <strong class="bold">Allow any accounts using these email domains to join your site, you can edit these settings any time</strong>. It will then list each domain from the email addresses listed in the top box.</p>
			<p>You should not select any domains that you do not have control over, for example, gmail.com. Clicking on <a id="_idIndexMarker420"/>one of the email domain boxes will allow any person with an email address under that domain to gain access to the system without needing an invite first.</p>
			<p>Finally, you can personalize the invitational email that is sent to the email address(es) entered at the top by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Personalize email invite</strong> link. When you are ready to send the email, click the <strong class="bold">Invite 1 user</strong> button. The number will change based on the number of emails entered above.</p>
			<p>Once you have invited users, they will be added as users in your system. The new users will show up at the bottom of the screen, as shown previously in <em class="italic">Figure 8.2</em>. A screenshot of that bottom section is shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.4</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>User list</h2>
			<p>The list of user<a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>s has some excellent information, including the <strong class="bold">Last activity</strong> date of the user (basically meaning the last time the user logged in), the <strong class="bold">Status</strong> of the user (or whether the user is active or inactive), and finally, under <strong class="bold">Actions</strong>, whether the user has accepted the invite:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.4_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.4 – User list&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4 – User list</p>
			<p>Also, you can click on <strong class="bold">Show details</strong> for active users to see more personal information, such as what groups each user belongs to and their current role in the system (the same <strong class="bold">Role</strong> shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.3</em>). You can add users to a group on that user detail page, or you can click on the ellipsis <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>menu (three dots) and add at that point.</p>
			<p>Next, we will follow the process <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>to create new groups. While on the left-hand menu, click <strong class="bold">Groups</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.5_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5 – Groups&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5 – Groups</p>
			<p>The result will land you on the <strong class="bold">Groups</strong> page, showing a list of all current groups in your system. Again, when you first set up your Jira instance, there will be just a handful of groups created with the system. To add a new group, click on the <strong class="bold">Create group</strong> button in the top right of the screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.6_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.6 – Create group&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.6 – Create group</p>
			<p>As you arrive on the screen <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>displayed in <em class="italic">Figure 8.7</em>, you will have the ability to enter the <code>Staff Meeting Access</code>, which we will later use for issue-level security. This group will represent the users who will have access to all issues on the staff meeting project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.7_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.7 – Group name&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.7 – Group name</p>
			<p>You can check the box for <strong class="bold">Add members in the next step</strong> to associate users with the group or you can return to the group later to add the names. When ready, click the <strong class="bold">Create group</strong> button to finalize your group. Next, we will discuss project roles and permissions.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Currently, you cannot change the name of the group once it is created, so be thoughtful when adding the group name. This bug is on Atlassian's list to fix in t<a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>he future.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Project roles and permissions</h1>
			<p>As with any system, you need some basic authentication and permission capability for the first level of security of your information. Jira Cloud provides you with authentication of users when you create your initial instance of Jira/Jira Work Management. Authentication is simply the process of validating that a user is who they really are when they log into the system.</p>
			<p>As your organization grows, you can extend this capability using the Atlassian Access tool to provide more control of the user setup and authentication process. See <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/access">https://www.atlassian.com/software/access</a> for more information.</p>
			<p>There are two ways to control access to your project, both of which involve the <strong class="bold">permission scheme</strong>. One route <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>would be to handle all the permissions directly in the permission scheme by granting permissions directly to individual users or groups.</p>
			<p>But this is the least advised method, as it <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>hampers the sharing of the scheme with projects that have different users. If you modify the permission scheme to use project roles instead, that gives you more flexibility with sharing the scheme. Let's look at that second option now:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>To modify who is linked to roles on your project, you must be a project administrator.</li>
				<li>Next, you will click on <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.8</em>:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.8_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.8 – Project settings&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.8 – Project settings</p></li>
				<li>As you enter <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong>, select the <strong class="bold">People</strong> option. If you are on a <strong class="bold">free</strong> plan, you will not be able to modify permissions or change the role assignment of persons on <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>any of your<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> projects:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.9_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.9 – People – free plan&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.9 – People – free plan</p></li>
				<li>If you are on a <strong class="bold">paid</strong> plan<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> of any level, you will be able to adjust permissions across your instance, including for all projects. As you enter the <strong class="bold">People</strong> screen, you will see a list of all groups and/or individual users who have access to the project and the project roles to which they are attached:<div><img src="img/Figure_8.10_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.10 – People – paid plan and roles&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.10 – People – paid plan and roles</p></li>
				<li>Click on<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> the <strong class="bold">Roles</strong> dropdown to show all project roles that have been created in your instance. Project roles are created at a global level. To add a new project role, you must be a Jira administrator. Then, go to <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">System</strong> | <strong class="bold">Project roles</strong>.</li>
				<li>The search box allows you to search for groups and users if you have a long list of people who appear on your screen. Or you can click on the <code>Staff Meeting Access</code> group that we created earlier to the <strong class="bold">Team</strong> role:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_8.11_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.11 – Adding people&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.11 – Adding people</p></li>
				<li>In <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>the <strong class="bold">Add people</strong> dialogue box, simply add a group or username in the top box and then select the role for the user.<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p><p class="callout">You can only select a single role when adding a new person or group.</p></li>
				<li>Once a new person or group has been added with a role, you can then update that person/group to associate additional roles, including adding multiple roles at one time:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.12_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.12 – Adding roles to a user&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.12 – Adding roles to a user</p>
			<p>Adding users or groups to project roles is the preferred method to control access to your project. In this manner, project administrators have direct control of granting access to users. Conversely, modifying the permission scheme requires the higher role level of the Jira administrator to make any changes.</p>
			<p>Speaking of which, let's turn our attention to <em class="italic">configuring the permissions scheme</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Configuring the permission scheme</h1>
			<p>You can access the <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>permission scheme in two different ways. Both begin by entering <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong>, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.13</em>.</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.13_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.13 – Configuring the permission scheme&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.13 – Configuring the permission scheme</p>
			<p>Once in the project settings, you can click on the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> option in the left-hand menu and then select the permission scheme name under the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> section of <strong class="bold">Summary</strong>.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> select the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> option from the left-hand menu to directly enter the scheme. See <em class="italic">Figure 8.13</em> for clarity on selecting either of these options.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Remember that if you are on the free plan, you are not able to modify the permission scheme. All users under the free plan are automatically project administrators on all projects. Only paid plans allow the permission scheme to be modified. The following sections assume a paid plan.</p>
			<p>Once you enter the permission scheme, you can peruse all permissions for the project and which users, groups, or project roles have been granted those permissions. You have two options at this time – the first is to <strong class="bold">edit the permissions</strong> in the scheme, meaning modifying which users, groups, or project roles are linked to the permission. Secondly, you can <strong class="bold">link the project</strong> to a different permission scheme. The latter means that the new permission scheme would be a shared scheme:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.14_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.14 – Editing the permission scheme&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.14 – Editing the permission scheme</p>
			<p>Note that if you <a id="_idIndexMarker434"/>have any marketplace apps in your instance, there will be a project role added to all permission schemes for the project role of <strong class="bold">Atlassian-addons-project-access</strong>. This is necessary for the app to function properly and make the needed issue changes on your project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.15_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.15 – Granting permissions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.15 – Granting permissions</p>
			<p>Clicking on the <strong class="bold">Edit permissions</strong> option will take you to the dialogue box in <em class="italic">Figure 8.15</em>. To remove any current permissions, simply click the <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> link and select the permission to remove. To add a new permission, click the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> option, which will display the <strong class="bold">Grant permission</strong> popup screen.</p>
			<p>There are several options that can be granted, as also shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.15</em>. Once you have made the selection, click the <strong class="bold">Grant</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Permission helper</h2>
			<p>Once your permissions are all in<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> place as desired, you might still have problems that arise with individual users not having permissions to issues on your project.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">It would not be over-exaggerating that Atlassian has provided a very supportive function for tracking down the problem.</p>
			<p>To use the function, click on the <strong class="bold">Permission helper</strong> option, as shown previously in <em class="italic">Figure 8.14</em>. When the <strong class="bold">Permission helper</strong> screen is displayed, simply populate the <strong class="bold">User</strong>, <strong class="bold">Issue</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Permission</strong> fields, and click the <strong class="bold">Submit</strong> button at the bottom of the screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.16_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.16 – Permission helper&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.16 – Permission helper</p>
			<p>The bottom of the<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> screen will then display a verification that the user already has access or will show the recommendations on how to remedy the problem. <strong class="bold">Permission helper</strong> is available for both free and paid plans.</p>
			<p>In our final section, we will explore how to apply security down to the issue level that will allow different users to have access to different issues on the same project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Applying issue-level security</h1>
			<p>There are times when<a id="_idIndexMarker437"/> you want to have a little more granular security applied to your project. Some examples of this include the desire that reporters of issues can only see the issues that they have created and no other issues, that assignees of an issue can only see their issues, or only certain groups of users can see issues based on labels or components.</p>
			<p>This can all be implemented <a id="_idIndexMarker438"/>using <strong class="bold">issue security</strong>. To access this function, enter <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> and then select <strong class="bold">Issue Security</strong> on the left-hand menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.17_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.17 – Issue Security&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.17 – Issue Security</p>
			<p>For free plan users, this is how the screen would look:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.18_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.18 – Issue Security for free plan users&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.18 – Issue Security for free plan users</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note for Figure 8.16</p>
			<p class="callout">Free plans do not have the ability to alter permissions within your instance, including issue security.</p>
			<p>For the paid<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> version, when you desire to add an issue security scheme to your project, you must first create the scheme through the global permissions path, meaning you must be a Jira administrator to create the scheme. Go to <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> | <strong class="bold">Issue security schemes</strong>. Once there, you will see a list of existing security schemes (if any exist), and at the bottom of the list will be an <strong class="bold">Add issue security scheme</strong> button:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.19_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.19 – Add issue security scheme&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.19 – Add issue security scheme</p>
			<p>At this point, you can insert the name of your new scheme and add a description if you like. When complete, click the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to create the scheme, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.20</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.20_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.20 – Issue security scheme name&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.20 – Issue security scheme name</p>
			<p>After the new issue security scheme has been created, you will need to return to <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> for the project and select <strong class="bold">Issue security</strong> on the left-hand menu, as shown previously in <em class="italic">Figure 8.21</em>. Once on the <strong class="bold">Issue security</strong> screen, click the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu and choose the <strong class="bold">Select a scheme</strong> option to link your new scheme to the project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.21_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.21 – Linking a security scheme to the project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.21 – Linking a security scheme to the project</p>
			<p>After linking the<a id="_idIndexMarker440"/> scheme to the project, the options under the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu look very similar to the options that were available for the permission scheme. You can connect this project to a different-issue security scheme, which might be already connected to another project. Thus, you would be sharing the scheme.</p>
			<p>Sharing a scheme helps with the maintenance of your system in that you can make the change in one place instead of two (or three or four, or more!). In our company, we have dozens of product team projects linked to the same shared scheme. If you decide to share a scheme across projects, this would be the place to make that change. Your other option is to edit the current issue security scheme, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.22</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.22_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.22 – Editing issue security&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.22 – Editing issue security</p>
			<p>After clicking on the <strong class="bold">Edit issue security</strong> option, you will need to create a new security level for the new scheme. You can have multiple security levels within each scheme, which gives you the ability to have different security policies for different issues on your project.</p>
			<p>Give your security level a name and add a description if you like. When ready, click the <strong class="bold">Add Security Level</strong> button to create the security level:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.23_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.23 – Adding a security level&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.23 – Adding a security level</p>
			<p>Once the new<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> level has been created, you will need to click the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to identify who has access to this security level:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.24_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.24 – Issue security options&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.24 – Issue security options</p>
			<p>The result will be a dialogue box that allows you to add persons to the security level by including a single user, groups, values in custom fields, project roles, and so on. For example, clicking on <strong class="bold">Group</strong> and adding the value of administrators gives all persons with Jira administrator permissions access to the issues attached to that level.</p>
			<p>Other examples would <a id="_idIndexMarker442"/>be selecting <strong class="bold">Reporter</strong> or <strong class="bold">Assignee</strong>, which would allow whichever user is currently in those fields to see and access the issue. In other words, if the user is not the reporter or the assignee, they will not be able to even see the issue:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.25_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 8.25 – Editing the issue security&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p>It is suggested that you add at least one security level as the default for the scheme if using issue security. This will<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> ensure that all newly created issues will be attached to a security level. See <em class="italic">Figure 8.24</em> for the location of the link to the default value.</p>
			<p>Now that we can secure our project and provide access to select persons, let's look at some other functions that can be done as a project administrator.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>JWM project administrator capabilities</h1>
			<p>Possessing project administration permissions sounds impressive, but there are not actually many functions that the administrator can perform. In fact, the list is rather small. Or course, most permission schemes will grant special permissions to project administrators that other users or project roles will not have.</p>
			<p>The following highlights the most used or known aspects of the capabilities of a project administrator but is not intended to be an exhaustive list. You can find more information by searching in Atlassian's own documentation, but this will help get you started:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project roles</strong>: As <a id="_idIndexMarker444"/>discussed earlier in this chapter in the <em class="italic">Project roles and permissions</em> section, project administrators can add users to a project and place them in different roles.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Components</strong>: Components<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> are unique to each project and help to categorize work being done on the project. Project administrators can create and delete components on their projects.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Versions and releases</strong>: As with components, versions and releases<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> are unique to a project and can be added and deleted by project administrators.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue layout and screens</strong>: If the<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> screen is exclusively used on a single project, the project administrator will be able to make a few changes. However, the project administrator will have the ability to make changes directly in the issue layout, as discussed previously in <a href="B17952_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Fields, Screens, and Issue Layouts</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Workflows</strong>: Similar to screens, project administrators can make changes to workflows if the workflow<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> is uniquely associated with one project.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>And now we wrap up this chapter with a brief look and recap of functions that are available to Jira administrators and project administrators.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Jira administrators versus project administrators</h1>
			<p>Again, this is not intended to be an exhaustive list, and you can search Atlassian's documentation for more details. However, you can relate Jira administrator functions to be more global in nature, meaning they affect the entire Jira instance/site.</p>
			<p>Jira administrators can <a id="_idIndexMarker449"/>make changes to shared<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> schemes (workflows, screens, and issue types), create custom fields, edit the permission scheme, change ownership of shared dashboards and filters, and other system-level functions.</p>
			<p>For JWM, project administrators can make changes to non-shared objects and project roles on the project, but not the permission scheme used by the project. <em class="italic">Figure 8.26</em> shows a very brief table of permissions available for Jira administrators and project administrators. In a nutshell, Jira administrators can make changes globally within your Jira instance and project administrators can only make changes on the projects where they have the project administrator role:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.26 – Jira administrator versus project administrator permissions</p>
			<p>All of these come with a caveat for free subscriptions in that all users in the instance are project administrators.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>New terms learned in this chapter</h1>
			<p>Let's conclude the chapter by going through the list of new terms learned in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Jira administrator</strong>: The Jira administrator<a id="_idIndexMarker451"/> can make all changes at the system and project level within your Jira instance for the products the user has been granted access to.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organization administrator</strong>: The organization administrator<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> can add other organization administrators, create system-level API keys, verify domains for your site, implement Atlassian Access, and control the directory of managed users for your domain.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Site administrator</strong>: The site administrator<a id="_idIndexMarker453"/> can activate or deactivate users' access to products in your instance by inviting them to the instance. He/she can also create groups and assign users to those groups.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Free plan</strong>: A no-cost <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>JWM plan that is limited to 10 active users and does not have configurable permissions.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Paid plan</strong>: There are <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>various plans available for JWM for different levels of users. All come with the most flexible options for the administrator of your JWM product.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue security</strong>: Security<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> that can be applied at the issue level to completely grant access to or hide issues from users.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project roles</strong>: Project<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> administrators can add users to a project and place them in different roles.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Components</strong>: Components<a id="_idIndexMarker458"/> are unique to each project and help to categorize work being done on the project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Versions and releases</strong>: Versions<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> and releases are unique to a project and can be added and deleted by project administrators. They group issues by release and can be used to remove issues from boards.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we have learned how site administrators can invite new users to your Jira organization and how project administrators can add users to a project and associate them with roles to grant them permissions to the project. We also learned about the permission scheme and how it relates to project roles, groups, and users.</p>
			<p>Then, we delved into additional security capabilities using issue-level security as a layer on top of the permission scheme. And, finally, we learned some of the different functions that Jira administrators and project administrators can perform and what is unique to each role.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to migrate existing Jira projects to JWM projects, use shared schemes, and work with external functions.</p>
