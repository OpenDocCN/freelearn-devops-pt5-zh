    Large companies have multiple teams working on different projects and using the
    same JIRA instance, so it is usually important to manage the permissions. Maybe
    there are certain projects that should be private to a certain team, or there
    could be third-party contractors working on a specific project and they should
    not have access to all the projects. JIRA is incredible tool for managing the
    access level and permissions of users.

    this chapter, we will also take a look at project roles—the set of people working
    on an individual project.

    to people. The users to whom these issues will be assigned need to exist in the
    system. When JIRA is deployed in any organization, the first thing that should
    be done is gather the list of people who will be using this tool; hence, their
    accounts need to be created in JIRA. Each user will have their username and password
    unique to them; this allows them to log in to the system. JIRA has its own internal
    authentication mechanism as well as the ability to integrate with **Lightweight
    Directory Access Protocol** (**LDAP**).

- en: In large organizations where there is no license limit or where there is a need
    to create users regularly, as in the case of a customer care system, JIRA can
    be configured in two modes—public and private. If you want to enable signup, then
    configure JIRA in public mode and it will display a signup link on the user login
    screen. However, if you have a license limit in JIRA, then it is recommended that
    you use JIRA in private mode, as only in that case can JIRA Administrators create
    an account.

- en: Every project is executed by different people, each with their own set of responsibilities.
    Usually, certain aspects of the project are taken care of by these people who
    are part of a team. For instance, in the case of a software project, there will
    be a project lead who manages everything in the project and is responsible for
    overall progress, developers who work on the features, and then there is a team
    of testers to verify the built features. The first versions of JIRA had only groups,
    and JIRA administrators would end up creating multiple groups for various projects,
    such as proj-administrators, proj-developers, and so on. At the same time, the
    permission scheme for each project also needed to be defined for these groups.
    JIRA developers realized this was a problem and introduced the concept of project
    role that allows not only JIRA administrators but also the project administrator
    to add and remove users to their project roles.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In JIRA, you could have roles that are defined globally and are available in
    all the projects, but the people who are in such roles would be different for
    each project. Just adding the project role and adding users to it in the project
    won't have any effect until the permission schemes are modified by defining what
    a project role will do in the project.

    and schemes, and to manage users. The administrative user is created when JIRA
    is installed. In big organizations where there is a team of people taking care
    of JIRA, there could be multiple JIRA administrators. There is a group called
    **jira-adminstators** in JIRA. The administrative user that is created during
    installation is part of this group, and more users can be added to it later on.

    features that need to be restricted. A **JIRA Administrators** permission allows
    users to perform most of the administrative functions, except system restore,
    importing and exporting, and changes to the mail configurations, as these features
    could potentially lead to system breakdown and may result in loss of data as well.
    So, it is advisable to only give the **JIRA System Administrators** permission
    to one or two people in the organization, and the rest could have the **JIRA Administrators**
    permission.
