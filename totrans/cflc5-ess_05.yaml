- en: Confluence is a great tool for collaboration, but how do you use Confluence
    to collaborate with others? Imagine that you just wrote a great post, and you
    want somebody to review it before publishing it, or you just had a meeting and
    want some people to take actions based on that meeting.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The most important thing for collaboration is the availability of content, and
    in Confluence all the content is, by default, available for all the users. The
    next thing is to get people involved, and Confluence offers us several methods
    for doing exactly that.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Mentions are a great way of getting people to participate in building useful
    and relevant content. You can mention a person in a special way that will trigger
    Confluence to send that person a notification. This is called an **@mention**.
    The @mention notifications work on pages, blog posts, and comments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Confluence will send an e-mail message to users letting them know that they
    have been mentioned in that page. This message is sent when you save the page
    but only if the mentioned person has view permissions for that page.

    or content. For example, if you want **Arthur Dent** to take a look at some requirement,
    just mention him in a comment to get him involved. Don't try to spam people you
    want to collaborate with; use the mentions sparingly. Another way to get people
    involved is by sharing your content.
