<p>DevOps and big data are most sought-after technology trends bringing multifold benefits to business, industries, and R and D centers. Their widespread adoption is associated with the popularity and acceptance of Open source tools along with other technology advancements, such as cloud computing, containers, and the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>In this book, we will discuss the business drivers and market trends contributing to the evolution of technology. We will explore the key technological concepts, such as NoSQL databases,  microservices, data science, and data visualization. We will build big data enterprise applications, using core architectural principles, based on the Spark in-memory engine. We will discuss DevOps practices and frameworks, and their application with popular tools, to prepare for continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. We will dive deeper into the popular open source tools, such as Chef, Ansible, Jenkins, Git, and Stack, which assist in the automation of the development to deployment cycle.</p>
<p>At every opportunity, this book introduces different flavors of popular vendor offerings with the key components and differences. This will provide the reader with information to aid their decision making. The technology choices discussed are for Hadoop platforms, cloud offerings, container and orchestration services, Internet of Things platforms, and NoSQL databases. The choice of popular tools for continuous integration, delivery, deployment, and monitoring is also thoroughly discussed. There are topics on capacity planning for Hadoop cluster, and security models for data and cloud based, discussed to provide reader with comprehensive knowledge on these subjects.</p>
<p>The migration strategy to DevOps for different systems, including big data systems, cloud platforms, microservices, data sciences, security authentications, and Internet of Things platforms, is discussed. ERP systems adoption to DevOps is also shared with detailed testing strategy.</p>
<p>Every effort is made to benefit the reader to learn the wide range of technology, tools and platform evolutions, frameworks, and methodologies from practical usage perspective. I feel confident that reader will find it very interesting and useful from multiple perspectives.</p>
