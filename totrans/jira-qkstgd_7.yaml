    start working on the project, you will also want to track the progress of your
    work and analyzing the information that you have in your instance is very important.
    It could be as simple as knowing how many issues are complete in order to create
    a graphical report.

    to time. Depending upon the type of application you are using, the reports might
    vary slightly. We will also look at the dashboard, which is a great way to create
    our own custom reports.

    with Jira Core, which can be used by any business team in the company to track
    their day-to-day activities.

    To find these reports, go to the Reports section in your project sidebar and you
    will notice that here, the reports are grouped into three categories: Issue analysis,
    Forecast & management, and Other, as shown in the following screenshot:'

    for a project or filter. This helps you see whether your backlog is being kept
    up-to-date. Basically, it means the average number of days for which issues are
    in an unresolved state on a given date as follows:'

    total story points planned were 11 and, based on the sprint duration, ideally,
    the total story points should be burned by the end of the sprint. This is represented
    by the baseline going down. As the work begins, another line representing the
    actual completion of the work will start that follows the original baseline. In
    an ideal scenario, the actual line should follow the baseline and, if the line
    goes up, then this means that more work is added in between the sprint, which
    is not good practice.
  prefs: []

    that it is unlikely that the team will complete its work on time.

- en: When the sprint is planned, an estimation is done regarding the work that can
    probably be finished by the end of the sprint. At the start of a new project,
    this is a little difficult to estimate. Also, as the project progresses, team
    members might change or become unavailable, so it is very important to know the
    current capacity of the team.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The preceding chart tells us that in Sample Sprint 1, the team's commitment
    was 18, but 16 completed, while in Sample Sprint 2, the team's commitment was
    11, and 11 completed, and finally, in Sample Sprint 3, the commitment was also
    delivered and completed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Hence, the average capacity of the team is 16+11+14 divided by 3, in other words,
    13.6, or roughly 14\. Hence, based on past performance, we can allocate work to
    this team worth 14 story points.

    or dropping, then appropriate action can be taken on time to improve it.

- en: The reports we discussed earlier in this chapter are project specific and available
    when you are within a project. However, when you log in to your Jira instance,
    the first thing you see is a system dashboard, which is a default dashboard containing
    a set of small reports also known as gadgets. We can always create our own custom
    dashboard showing us information from one or multiple projects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One advantage of the dashboard is that you don't need to go to individual projects
    and configure various reports one by one. Using the dashboard, you can get a bird's-eye
    view of what is happening in your project or team in one go. Let's create our
    own dashboard.

- en: Yes, you have guessed correctly. These are similar reports to the ones that
    we discussed earlier, but this time, we want to have them handy on our dashboard.
    The gadgets will let you choose the project for which you want to create a report. Once
    you do that, your dashboard will be ready.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One great thing about the dashboard is that, apart from creating a collection
    of reports in a single place, you can share it with other team members, display
    it on a big screen in your office, and, most importantly, you can create multiple
    dashboards showing different information from a variety of projects.

    in our Jira instance by first looking at various reports that come out-of-the-box,
    and later, we configured our own custom dashboard to have all those reports available
    to hand in one place.

- en: In the next and final chapter, we will discuss best practices that you should
    always keep in mind when using Jira, and also when you are customizing the tool
    because, although Jira allows you to configure many things, it is also very important
    that you are aware of the consequences if these customizations are not done right.
    Observing best practices will ensure the longevity and top-notch performance of
    your Jira instance.
