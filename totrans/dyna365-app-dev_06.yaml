    create custom business apps. In this chapter, we will learn about Microsoft Flow,
    which can be defined as a cloud-based service that enables users to build workflows
    that automate different tasks and processes across multiple applications and services.

    to create automated workflows between different applications and services. The
    list of applications and services we can use with Microsoft Flow is constantly
    expanding. Currently, Microsoft Flow supports more than 170 service connectors,
    which includes popular applications like Dynamics 365, Office 365 Outlook, OneDrive
    for Business, SharePoint, Twitter, and Facebook.

    Flow connects to, such as Twitter, SharePoint, Facebook, and so on. These services
    can act as sources as well as destinations within a Flow. Following is a list

    trigger from a button in Microsoft Flow that needs to be manually initiated by
    the end user, or they can be automated, scheduled to run at a specific time or
    started from another application or service. A trigger can also be vent-based;
    when an event occurs in the service, it will trigger the flow. For example, a
    lead record being created in CRM or a new item being added in SharePoint''s list
    can be the trigger. The following is a list of triggers specific to Dynamics 365:![](img/a9b8453c-81b0-470f-bd34-77df3f2d5274.png)'

    to Dynamics 365\. We also created a custom Dynamics 365 flow. In the next section,
    we will compare Flow with Dynamics 365 Workflow, which will help us to choose
    one over the other.

- en: There are certain scenarios which can be implemented using either Dynamics Workflow
    or Microsoft Flow. Following are a few points we can consider when deciding.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If a scenario can be implemented within Dynamics 365 using Workflow, then Workflow
    is the better choice. This is because we can easily manage and monitor it from
    within CRM, through System Jobs. For managing and monitoring a flow, we need to
    go outside CRM and do the same from within Flow's portal.

- en: Workflow can run both synchronously and asynchronously. Workflow will trigger
    immediately when conditions are met. So, in scenarios where we want immediate
    action to be taken, Workflow is a better choice. Moreover, Workflow is solution-aware,
    so it can move easily from one environment to another.

- en: Microsoft Flow is a better fit in scenarios where we want to seamlessly integrate
    with third-party applications and services such as Twitter, Facebook, Yammer,
    and so on. To implement this within Workflow would require development effort,
    that is, writing a custom workflow activity.

    we can send notifications in the form of SMS, push notifications to Flow's Mobile
    App, and email notifications from an account other than the Dynamics 365 User
    through Gmail, Hotmail, and so on, without writing a single line of code.

    the records of an entity. We can use it to find a list of records of an entity
    matching a specific condition and can then act upon it. This can also be used
    to design a flow which either updates or deletes the child records when a parent
    record is updated or deleted. Normally, to implement such a scenario, we would
    have to write a custom workflow activity or plugin inside CRM. With Microsoft
    Flow, we can achieve this without writing a single line of code:'

    that can seamlessly integrate with multiple applications and services, and without
    even a single line of code. We also had a detailed look at Microsoft Flow in the
    context of Dynamics 365 and learned how to write a simple flow that integrates
    multiple applications.
