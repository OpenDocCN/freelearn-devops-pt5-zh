    which can be defined as a cloud-based service that enables users to build workflows
    that automate different tasks and processes across multiple applications and services.

    to create automated workflows between different applications and services. The
    list of applications and services we can use with Microsoft Flow is constantly
    expanding. Currently, Microsoft Flow supports more than 170 service connectors,
    which includes popular applications like Dynamics 365, Office 365 Outlook, OneDrive
    for Business, SharePoint, Twitter, and Facebook.

    covered by existing templates, we can create our own flow from scratch—that is,
    create one from the beginning.

    the end user, or they can be automated, scheduled to run at a specific time or
    started from another application or service. A trigger can also be vent-based;
    when an event occurs in the service, it will trigger the flow. For example, a
    lead record being created in CRM or a new item being added in SharePoint''s list
    can be the trigger. The following is a list of triggers specific to Dynamics 365:![](img/a9b8453c-81b0-470f-bd34-77df3f2d5274.png)'

- en: If a scenario can be implemented within Dynamics 365 using Workflow, then Workflow
    is the better choice. This is because we can easily manage and monitor it from
    within CRM, through System Jobs. For managing and monitoring a flow, we need to
    go outside CRM and do the same from within Flow's portal.

- en: Workflow can run both synchronously and asynchronously. Workflow will trigger
    immediately when conditions are met. So, in scenarios where we want immediate
    action to be taken, Workflow is a better choice. Moreover, Workflow is solution-aware,
    so it can move easily from one environment to another.

    with third-party applications and services such as Twitter, Facebook, Yammer,
    and so on. To implement this within Workflow would require development effort,
    that is, writing a custom workflow activity.

    that can seamlessly integrate with multiple applications and services, and without
    even a single line of code. We also had a detailed look at Microsoft Flow in the
    context of Dynamics 365 and learned how to write a simple flow that integrates
