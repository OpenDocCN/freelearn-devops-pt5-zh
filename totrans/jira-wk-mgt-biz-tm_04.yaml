    some real work. As you might have already guessed, the first step will be to create
    a project. We will walk through an example using the project management template,

    different fields for the **Sub-task** issue type. If that is the case, you will

    increased functionality and flexibility. However, it also brings increased complexity
    and frustration for new administrators. We will discuss this more fully in [*Chapter
    8*](B17952_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132), *Configuring Permissions and Simple
    Administration*, but some mention of it needs to take place here.
  prefs: []

- en: You can think of a scheme as a bucket holding multiple items. So, a screen scheme
    can hold multiple screens in it – each performing different functions, such as
    edit, create, or view. A workflow scheme can hold multiple workflows – each associated
    with a different issue type and providing for varied paths across the board for
    each type.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
