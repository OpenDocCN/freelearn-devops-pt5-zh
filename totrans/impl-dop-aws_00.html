<span class="strong"><strong>DevOps</strong></span> and <span class="strong"><strong>AWS </strong></span>are two key subjects in the tech industry that have been steadily growing in popularity in recent years and for a good reason.</p><p>DevOps is gradually becoming the <span class="emphasis"><em>de facto</em></span> methodology or framework and is adopted by organizations of all sizes. It has enabled technology teams to work more efficiently and made their work more rewarding by tightening the feedback loop between the developer and the end user. Team members enjoy a more pleasant, more productive work environment through much increased collaboration.</p><p>In this book, we will first examine the philosophy behind <span class="emphasis"><em>DevOps</em></span>, then proceed with some practical examples of its most popular principles.</p><p>
<span class="emphasis"><em>AWS</em></span> is nowadays synonymous with <span class="emphasis"><em>Cloud Computing, </em></span>sitting at the top of the industry charts with its 31% market share. Starting back in 2006, <span class="emphasis"><em>Amazon Web Services</em></span> has evolved into a large, independent, sophisticated ecosystem in the <span class="emphasis"><em>Cloud.</em></span> It is and has been launching new services at an astonishing rate. The <span class="emphasis"><em>AWS </em></span>product categories range from raw compute and database resources to storage, analytics, <span class="emphasis"><em>AI, </em></span>game development, and mobile services to <span class="emphasis"><em>IoT </em></span>solutions<span class="emphasis"><em>.</em></span>
</p><p>We will use <span class="emphasis"><em>AWS</em></span> as a platform to apply <span class="emphasis"><em>DevOps</em></span> techniques on. In the chapters to follow, we will see how the convenience and elasticity of <span class="emphasis"><em>AWS</em></span> greatly complements the innovative approach of <span class="emphasis"><em>DevOps</em></span> to system administration and application development.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf08lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
