- en: DevOps is the newest revolution in deploying software quickly and efficiently.
    With a set of automation tools, an orchestration platform, and a few processes,
    companies can speed up the release cycle of their IT systems by enabling the engineers
    to do more with fewer resources and become more engaged in the business process.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In order to follow this book and its contents, you will need a trial account
    on Google Cloud Platform and an editor (I used Atom but any other editor will
    work) as well as Node.js installed on your local machine. You will also need to
    install Docker locally in order to test the different examples. We will use **Google
    Container Engine** (**GKE**) for the Kubernetes examples but if you want to play
    locally with Kubernetes, Minikube can also be used, although you need a fairly
    powerful computer.
