<p class="chapter-content"><span>Apps are a new feature introduced in Dynamics 365 or Dynamics CRM version 9.x. Prior to the following versions of Dynamics CRM, it was not possible to create custom apps catering to any module in Dynamics CRM implementations. There used to exist one single layer of the site map which provided links to various entities, dashboards, and more, for the</span> entire organization<span>. However, with Microsoft Dynamics 365, Microsoft has introduced the concepts of apps which can cater to specific business areas or modules. Also, we have the built-in App Designer in the product itself. This designer allows the administrator, customizers, or users with appropriate privileges, to easily design an app by simply adding, dragging, and dropping the components, within the App Designer canvas.</span></p>
<p>In this chapter, we will be covering the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview of apps in Dynamics 365</li>
<li>Prerequisite privileges required for configuring apps</li>
<li>Configuring Dynamics 365 apps</li>
<li>Understanding the app properties</li>
<li>Understanding the App Designer interface</li>
<li>Adding and removing components, validating, publishing, and securing an app</li>
<li>Exporting and importing apps</li>
</ul>

<p>Apps are a new feature introduced in Dynamics 365 to provide quick navigation for the users to quickly access the most relevant entities, and so on. Apps are convenient and each app has its own site map. The details of designing a site map in Dynamics 365 will be discussed in <a href="e7404a4e-56fd-4a70-80dc-4ed291d7f654.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Customize Application Navigation</em>. Briefly, a <strong>site map</strong> is a component which stores navigation links and is internally stored in XML format in Dynamics 365. Apps can contain components such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Entities</li>
<li>Dashboards</li>
<li>Forms</li>
<li>Views</li>
<li>Charts</li>
<li>Business process flows</li>
</ul>

<p>Before we start discussing the steps required to configure apps in Dynamics 365, it is important to understand the prerequisite security privileges which are required for a particular user, before they are able to have access to configuring apps. This is particularly important if you wish to give a power user or end-user the ability to design and use their own apps. The following table summarizes the minimum privileges required to configure apps in Dynamics 365:</p>

<li><strong>Configure App Navigation with Sitemap designer:</strong> Every app can have its own site map. A detailed description is given in <a href="e7404a4e-56fd-4a70-80dc-4ed291d7f654.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Customize Application Navigation</em>.</li>
<li><strong>Include Required App components:</strong> App components can consist of artifacts or Entity Assets which need to be included in the app.</li>
<li><strong>Check App for any missing required components:</strong> The app needs to be checked for any missing required components. This can be done by hitting <span class="packt_screen">Validate</span> before publishing the app.</li>
<li><strong>Make App available for use by Publish:</strong> For users to be able to access the app, it needs to be published. A detailed description is available in the following sections.</li>
<li><strong>Configure Security Role access for the App:</strong> Apps can be secured to allow an only certain set of users to be able to access the app. A detailed description is available in the following sections.</li>

<p>Now that we understand the app properties from the last section, it is time to configure our first Dynamics 365 app using the Dynamics 365 App Designer, and also understand the interface. The following steps can be taken to create a Dynamics 365 app:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">My Apps</span> as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9a859d89-cc9d-452d-8849-e6d600b18a04.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">My Apps</span> screen, you will be able to see a list of already configured apps out of the box, or any other custom apps already configured in your organization:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/15ca32a2-6cad-473f-999a-500c16f4b703.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>On the <span class="packt_screen">My Apps</span> screen, select the <span class="packt_screen">Create New App button</span>, available at the top right of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="51" src="assets/97e37c6b-23c7-487e-bed4-845f766ca436.png" width="195"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Alternatively, you can also select the <span class="packt_screen">Create New App</span> tile, available at the bottom of the <span class="packt_screen">My Apps </span>screen, under the <span class="packt_screen">Apps</span> <span class="packt_screen">Being Edited</span> option on the screen:</p>

<ol start="4">
<li>The next screen will show the App Designer screen with all the app properties that we described in the last section:</li>
</ol>

<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">This image shows the App designer screen</div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Choose a meaningful name for the app. In our case, we are creating an app for quickly doing Lead Generation so we will call the app <span class="packt_screen">Lead Generation</span>. Notice that <span class="packt_screen">Unique Name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">App URL Suffix</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Web URL</span> properties are automatically generated:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="249" src="assets/56d9b79e-bd24-44f1-9ce9-2f335f063db6.png" width="520"/></div>
<div class="packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">This image shows the Lead Generation </div>
<div class="packt_infobox"><strong>Note:</strong> In this step, we keep the default properties for the app. You may wish to override these automatically generated properties.</div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Supply a meaningful description of the app (the URL should be unique):</li>

<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/4b289137-9cf9-4cd1-83be-3e4f37865ef2.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Also, we are going to keep the <span class="packt_screen">Client</span> type as <span class="packt_screen">Web</span> (classic CRM web interface).</p>
<ol start="7">
<li>In order to pick a different icon for the app, uncheck the checkbox for <span class="packt_screen">Use Default Image,</span> and then select a web resource you want to utilize as an <span class="packt_screen">Icon</span> for the app:</li>

<p style="padding-left: 60px">We are going to select <span class="packt_screen">Legacy CRM icon</span> for this particular app. Notice that on selecting the icon, under the <span class="packt_screen">App Tile</span> preview towards the right, you can see the preview of the <span class="packt_screen">App Tile</span>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bd6d8b8f-e1b2-4236-bcaf-eb1a29d60d10.png"/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Optionally, you may choose to <span class="packt_screen">using the existing Solution to create the app</span> and also <span class="packt_screen">choose a Welcome page for the app</span>. We will skip the settings for our first Dynamics 365 app and click <span class="packt_screen">Done</span>, available at the top right of the App Designer screen:</li>

<ol start="9">
<li>After clicking <span class="packt_screen">Done</span>, the App Designer will navigate to the screen to select the different components.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">An app can consist of two distinct types of components, as described in the following table:</p>
<table class="MsoTableGrid">
<tbody>
<tr>

<p><strong>S.No.</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p><strong>Component Name</strong></p>

<p>Let's now understand the layout of the App Designer. The App Designer is split into two distinct areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Canvas</strong>: Toward the left-hand side of the App Designer, you are presented with a canvas area where you can add app components. The following screenshot gives a sample of the canvas area:</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/80a1420f-ccea-4fab-9aec-e4d8866ced38.png"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Component properties</strong>: Toward the right-hand side of the App Designer, you are presented with an area where you can select the various components and their properties. The following screenshot gives a sample of <span class="packt_screen">Components</span> and its <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span> area:</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="489" src="assets/092e84da-3d08-49f8-a190-12781fabc074.png" width="234"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Notice here that the classification of different components is also mentioned in the <span class="packt_screen">Components</span> area, where the components are grouped into two distinct categories,  <span class="packt_screen">ARTIFACTS</span> and <span class="packt_screen">ENTITY ASSETS</span>. On the canvas in the App Designer, if you select <span class="packt_screen">Dashboards</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Business Process Flow</span>, all the entities under <span class="packt_screen">Dashboards</span> or <span class="packt_screen">Business Process Flow</span> are automatically selected by the App Designer. Then, you just need to select the appropriate entity asset under <span class="packt_screen">Entities,</span> such as <span class="packt_screen">View</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Form</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Chart</span>.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In our case for our <span class="packt_screen">Lead Generation</span> app, as no <span class="packt_screen">Site Map</span> was selected, <span class="packt_screen">Configuration Missing</span> will be shown in the <span class="packt_screen">Site Map</span> area:</p>

<p>In the last section, we published a new custom app called Lead Generation. In this section, we will try to use our newly created custom app. Follow these steps to use your newly created custom app:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expand the area under <span class="packt_screen">Dynamics 365</span> and you should be able to locate the newly published Dynamics 365 app for Lead Generation:</li>

            <article>
                
<p>In real-world scenarios, it is often a requirement to give specific app access to a certain set of users only. For this requirement, we can secure apps to be accessible via certain security roles only.</p>
<p>We now wish to edit the Lead Generation app security permissions so that they are only available to sales manager and salesperson security roles. We can do this by enabling app access for certain Security Roles only. Follow these steps to enable app access for certain security roles only:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Settings </span>| <span class="packt_screen">My</span><span class="packt_screen">Apps</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">More</span> options under the <span class="packt_screen">Lead Generation</span> app:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/5b6ff7e6-cd20-4d99-ac9a-20b0575d2b0c.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select the <span class="packt_screen">Manage Roles</span> option. This will launch the <span class="packt_screen">Manage Roles</span> window on the right side of the screen, where various <span class="packt_screen">Security Roles</span> can be selected. Select the appropriate roles and click <span class="packt_screen">Save</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/53829707-925f-478c-88ff-a46a17673624.png"/></div>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The system administrator and system customizer roles have full access on all apps by default. It is recommended you keep this setting as these security roles will need to maintain or customize apps in future.</p>
<p>Now, Lead Generation App is only available to sales manager and salesperson roles as well as system administrator and system customizer roles.</p>

<p>If we wish to edit the layout or customization of any of the artifacts or <span class="packt_screen">Entity Asset</span> components in an app, we can do this by using the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <span class="packt_screen">Settings<span><span> </span></span></span>|<span class="packt_screen"><span><span> </span></span></span><span class="packt_screen">My</span><span class="packt_screen">Apps</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">More</span> options under the Lead Generation App:</li>

</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cc47cabb-8713-4cda-b6b9-1effcd0ab80b.png"/></div>
<p>Now, the Lead Generation App can be edited as required, and saved. Then, it needs to be validated and published again for changes to be reflected to the users.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we saw how apps are introduced as a new and powerful navigation feature in Dynamics 365. We also understood how apps provide the users with quick access to the most relevant options they need to carry out their day-to-day CRM work. Now we can have multiple site maps per app, and built-in App Designer tools in the product itself. We also had a detailed look at the new App Designer and some common operations that can be performed through it.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will cover the new Sitemap Designer and how it can be used to create site maps with intuitive drag and drop capabilities.</p>
