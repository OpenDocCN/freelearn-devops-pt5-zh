<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rebasing commits to another branch</li>
<li>Continuing a rebase with merge conflicts</li>
<li>Rebasing selected commits interactively</li>
<li>Squashing commits using an interactive rebase</li>
<li>Changing the author of commits using a rebase</li>
<li>Autosquashing commits</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Introduction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Rebase is an incredibly strong Git feature. Hopefully, you have used it before; if not, you might have heard about it. Rebasing is exactly what the word implies. So, if you have a certain commit, <kbd>A</kbd>, which is based on commit <kbd>B</kbd>, then rebasing <kbd>A</kbd> to <kbd>C</kbd> would result in commit <kbd>A</kbd> being based on commit <kbd>C</kbd>.</p>
<p>As you will see in the different examples in this chapter, it is not always as simple as that.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Rebasing commits to another branch</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To start with, we are going to perform a very simple rebase, where we will introduce a new file, commit that file, make a change to it, and then commit it again so that we end up with two new commits.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Before we start, we need a repository to work in. You can use a previous clone of <kbd>jgit</kbd>, but to get a close-to-identical output from the example, you can clone the <kbd>jgit</kbd> repository.</p>
<p>The <kbd>jgit</kbd> repository can be cloned as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ git clone https://git.eclipse.org/r/jgit/jgit chapter4</strong>
<strong>$ cd chapter4</strong></pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We start by creating a local branch and then make two commits by performing the following steps; these are the commits that we want to rebase onto another branch:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check out a new branch, <kbd>rebaseExample</kbd>, which tracks <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git checkout -b rebaseExample --track origin/stable-3.1</strong>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you execute <kbd>git rebase</kbd>, Git starts by finding the common ancestor of the current <kbd>HEAD</kbd> branch and the branch you want to rebase to. When Git finds <kbd>merge-base</kbd>, it will find the commits that are not available in the branch you are rebasing onto. Git will simply try to apply those commits one by one.</p>

<p>When you rebase a commit or a branch on top of a different <kbd>HEAD</kbd>, you may eventually see a conflict.</p>
<p>If there is a conflict, you will be asked to solve the merge conflict and continue with the rebase using <kbd>git rebase --continue</kbd>.</p>

<p>We will be creating a commit that adds the same <kbd>fishtank.txt</kbd> file on top of theÂ <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> branch; then, we will try to rebase this on top of the <kbd>rebaseExample</kbd> branch we created in the <em>Rebasing commits to another branch</em> section:</p>

<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-196 image-border" src="img/a936be88-0c44-4f1c-987a-563944183fa7.png" style="width:26.25em;height:10.17em;"/></div>

<p>As we learned from the first example, Git will apply the commits that are not available in the branch you are rebasing onto. In our example, it is only our commit, as we made it, that is available on the <kbd>rebaseExample2</kbd> branch.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You might have noticed in the output of the failing rebase that you have two extra options for the commit.</p>
<p>When you have resolved this problem, run <kbd>git rebase --continue</kbd>. If you prefer to skip this patch, run <kbd>git rebase --skip</kbd> instead. To check out the original branch and stop rebasing, run <kbd>git rebase --abort</kbd>.</p>
<p>The first extra option we have is to totally ignore this patch by skipping it; you can do this using <kbd>git rebase --skip</kbd>. In our example, this will cause our branch to be fast-forwarded to the <kbd>rebaseExample</kbd> branch. So, both our branches will point to the same commit hash.</p>
<p>The second option is to abort the rebasing. If we choose to do this, then we will go back to the branch as it was prior to starting the rebase. This can be done usingÂ <kbd>git rebase --abort</kbd>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Rebasing selected commits interactively</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you are working on a new feature and have branched from an old release into a feature branch, you might want to rebase this branch onto the latest release. When looking into the list of commits on the feature branch, you may realize that some of the commits are not suitable for the new release. In that case, when you want to rebase the branch onto a new release, you will need to remove some commits. This can be achieved with interactive rebasing, where Git gives you the option to pick the commits you wish to rebase.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To get started with this example, you need to check the previously created branch, <kbd>rebaseExample</kbd>; if you don't have this branch, follow the steps from the <em>Rebasing commits to another branch</em>Â section and use the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ git checkout rebaseExample</strong>
<strong>Switched to branch 'rebaseExample'</strong>
<strong>Your branch is ahead of 'origin/stable-3.1' by 109 commits.</strong>
<strong>(use "git push" to publish your local commits)</strong></pre>
<p>Notice that, because we are tracking <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd>, the Git checkout will tell us how far ahead we are in comparison with that branch.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We will try to rebase our current branch, <kbd>rebaseExample</kbd>, on top of the <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> branch by performing the following steps. Remember that Git will apply the commits that are not available on the branch we are rebasing to; so, in this case, there will be a lot of commits:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rebase the branch onto <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> by using the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git rebase --interactive origin/stable-3.1</strong></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>What you will see now is a list of all the commits you will be rebasing onto the <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> branch. These commits are all the commits between the <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> and <kbd>rebaseExample</kbd> branches. The commits will be applied from top to bottom, hence, the commits will be listed in reverse orderâat least compared to what you would normally see in Git. This actually makes good sense. The commits have the keyword <kbd>pick</kbd> to the left and then the abbreviated commit hash, and finally the title of the commit subject.</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">If you scroll down to the bottom, you will see a list along the lines of the following:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>pick 43405e6 My brand new fishtank</strong>
<strong>pick 08d0906 Feed the fish</strong>
<strong># Rebase da6e87b..08d0906 onto da6e87b</strong>
<strong>#</strong>
<strong># Commands:</strong>
<strong>#  p, pick = use commit</strong>
<strong>#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message</strong>
<strong>#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending</strong>
<strong>#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit</strong>
<strong>#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message</strong>
<strong>#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell</strong>
<strong>#</strong>
<strong># These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.</strong>
<strong>#</strong>
<strong># If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.</strong>
<strong>#</strong>
<strong># However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.</strong>
<strong>#</strong>
<strong># Note that empty commits are commented out</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">So, if we only want our <kbd>fishtank</kbd> commits to be based on top of the <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> branch, we should remove all the commits except for our two.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Remove all the lines except for the two commits at the bottom; for now, leave <kbd>pick</kbd> as the keyword. Save the file and close the editor, and you will get the following message from Git:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/rebaseExample.</strong></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now, with <kbd>gitk</kbd>, check whether we accomplished what we predicted. The next screenshot shows our two <kbd>fishtank</kbd> commits on top of the <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> branch. The following screenshot is what we expected:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-197 image-border" src="img/2fa6ba1e-496b-4bc2-8814-ed2f55c70ce5.png" style="width:25.50em;height:11.08em;"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The same thing could actually be achieved with a single short Git command. We have been rebasing commits from the <kbd>origin/stable-3.2</kbd> branch to the <kbd>rebaseExample</kbd> branch onto the <kbd>origin/stable-3.2</kbd> branch. This can also be achieved in the following manner:</p>
<pre><strong>$ git rebase --onto origin/stable-3.1 origin/stable-3.2 rebaseExample</strong>
<strong>First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...</strong>
<strong>Applying: My brand new fishtank</strong>
<strong>Applying: Feed the fish</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">The <kbd>--onto origin/stable-3.2</kbd> flag tells Git to rebase onto <kbd>origin/stable-3.2</kbd>, and it has to be fromÂ <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> to the <kbd>rebaseExample</kbd> branch. So, we end up having theÂ <kbd>rebaseExample</kbd> branch to the branch of the <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> and so on. The next diagram illustrates both before the rebase example, where we have our two commits on top of <kbd>origin/stable-3.2</kbd>, and after the rebase, where our commits are on top of <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd>, as we wanted:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-198 image-border" src="img/49a5c6d8-ec59-4496-8d7b-8864d0d28c6a.png" style="width:38.83em;height:21.83em;"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Squashing commits using an interactive rebase</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When I work on a local branch, I prefer to commit in small increments with a few comments on what I did in the commits; however, as these commits do not build or pass any test requirements, I cannot submit them for review and verification one by one. I have to merge them in my branch, but still, cherry-picking my fix would require me to cherry-pick twice the number of commits, which is not very handy.</p>
<p>What we can do is rebase and squash the commits into a single commit, or at least fewer commits.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To get started with this example, we need a new branch, namely <kbd>rebaseExample3</kbd>, which tracks <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd>. Create the branch with the following command:</p>
<pre><strong>$ git checkout -b rebaseExample3 --track origin/stable-3.1</strong>
<strong>Branch rebaseExample3 set up to track remote branch stable-3.1 from origin.</strong>
<strong>Switched to a new branch 'rebaseExample3'</strong></pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To really showcase this Git feature, we will start off six commits ahead of the <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> branch. This is to simulate the fact that we have just created six commits on top of the <kbd>rebaseExample3</kbd> branch; to do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Find a commit that is between <kbd>origin/stable-3.1</kbd> and <kbd>origin/stable-3.2</kbd>, and list the commits in reverse order. Alternatively, you can scroll down to the bottom of the output and find the commit we will use, as shown in the following snippet:</li>

<li>The editor will open, and you will see four commits, not six as you would expect. This is because the rebase, in general, refuses to take merged commits as part of the rebase scenario. Although you can use the <kbd>--preserve-merges</kbd> flag, as per the Git Help section, this is not recommended.</li>
</ol>
<p>According to the Git Help section,Â instead of ignoring merges,Â <kbd>--preserve-merges</kbd>Â tries to recreate them. The <kbd>--preserve-merges</kbd> flag uses the <kbd>--interactive</kbd> machinery internally, but combining it with the <kbd>--interactive</kbd> option explicitly is generally not a good idea, unless you know what you are doing (see the bugs in the following snippet).</p>

 Propagate IOException where possible when getting refs.
    
 Currently, Repository.getAllRefs() and Repository.getTags() </strong><br/><strong> silently
 ignores an IOException and instead returns an empty map. Repository
  is a public API and as such cannot be changed until the next major
  revision change. Where possible, update the internal jgit APIs to
  use the RefDatabase directly, since it propagates the error.

<p>Now we have squashed two commits, but we could have used other keywords when editing the rebase's to-do list.</p>
<p>We will try the fixup functionality, which works like the squash functionality, by performing the following steps; the exception is that Git will select the commit message of the commits using the <kbd>pick</kbd> keyword:</p>

<li>Start by resetting back to our starting point:</li>

<li>Once you close the editor, you will see rebase's progress through Git. As predicted, the commit message editor will not open.

<li>Finally, we can also confirm that we still have the same source code, but with different commits. This can be done by comparing this commit with the commit we created via <kbd>5218f7b</kbd>, using the following command:</li>

<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git diff 5218f7b</strong></pre>
<p>As predicted, there is no output from <kbd>git diff</kbd>, so we still have the same source code.</p>

<p>When starting to work on a new project, it is common to forget to set the author name and author email address for the specified project. Therefore, you will often have commits in your local branch that have been committed with the wrong username and/or email ID.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Before we begin this exercise, we need a branch, as always with Git. Name the branch <kbd>resetAuthorRebase</kbd> and make it track <kbd>origin/master</kbd>. Use the following command to achieve this:</p>
<pre><strong>$ git checkout -b resetAuthorRebase -t origin/master</strong>
<strong>Branch resetAuthorRebase set up to track remote branch 'master' from 'origin'.</strong>
<strong>Switched to a new branch 'resetAuthorRebase'</strong></pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Now, we want to change the author of all the commits from <kbd>origin/stable-3.2</kbd>Â to our <kbd>HEAD</kbd>, which is <kbd>master</kbd>. This is just an example; you will rarely have to change the author of commits that have already been published to a remote repository.</p>
<p>You can change the author of the <kbd>HEAD</kbd> commit by using <kbd>git commit --amend --reset-author</kbd>; however, this will only change the author of <kbd>HEAD</kbd> and leave the rest of the commits as they were. We will start by changing the author of the <kbd>HEAD</kbd> commit and then verify why that is wrong by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Change the author of the <kbd>HEAD</kbd> commit as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git commit --amend --reset-author</strong>

<ol start="3">
<li>We will list all the commits from <kbd>origin/stable-3.2</kbd> to <kbd>HEAD</kbd> and we will define a format with <kbd>%h</kbd> as the abbreviated commit hash, <kbd>%an</kbd> for the author's name, and <kbd>%ae</kbd> for the author's email address. From the output, you can see that I am now the author of the <kbd>HEAD</kbd> commit, but what we really wanted was to change the author of all the commits. To do this, we will rebase onto the <kbd>origin/stable-3.2</kbd> branch; then, for each commit, we will stop to amend and reset the author. Git can do most of that work with <kbd>--exec option</kbd> for the <kbd>git</kbd> rebase, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git rebase --interactive --exec "git commit --amend --reset-author" origin/stable-3.2</strong>
<strong>pick b14a939 Prepare 3.3.0-SNAPSHOT builds</strong>
<strong>exec git commit --amend --reset-author</strong>
<strong>pick f2abbd0 archive: Prepend a specified prefix to all entry filenames</strong>
<strong>exec git commit --amend --reset-author</strong></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>As you can see, Git has opened the rebase's to-do list for you, and between every commit, you have the <kbd>exec</kbd> keyword and the command we specified on the command line. You can have more <kbd>exec</kbd> lines between commits if you have a use case for them. Closing the editor will start the rebase.</li>
</ol>
<p>Â </p>
<ol start="5">
<li>As you will see, this process is not very good, as the commit message editor opens every time and you have to close the editor to allow Git to continue with the rebase. To stop the rebase, clear the commit message editor and Git will return to the command line; then, you can use <kbd>git rebase --abort</kbd> as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>Executing: git commit --amend --reset-author</strong>
<strong>Aborting commit due to empty commit message.</strong>
<strong>Execution failed: git commit --amend --reset-author</strong>
<strong>You can fix the problem, and then run</strong>
    
<strong>        git rebase --continue</strong>
<strong>$ git rebase --abort</strong></pre>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">To achieve what we really want, you can add the <kbd>--reuse-message</kbd> option for <kbd>git commit</kbd>; this will reuse the commit message for the commit you will specify. We want to use the message of <kbd>HEAD</kbd>, as we are going to amend it to the <kbd>HEAD</kbd> commit. So, try again, as shown in the following command:</p>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git rebase --interactive --exec "git commit --amend --reset-author --reuse-message=HEAD" origin/stable-3.2</strong>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>It works as you would expect! There is one thing to remember: when using the <kbd>exec</kbd>Â option, Git will check the work area for unstaged and staged changes. Consider the following command line:</p>
<pre> <strong>exec echo rainy_day &gt; weather_main.txt<br/> exec echo sunny_day &gt; weather_california.txt</strong></pre>
<p>If you were to have a line as illustrated in the preceding command, the first <kbd>exec</kbd> would be executed and you would then have an unstaged change in your work area. Git would complain and you would have to solve that before continuing with the next <kbd>exec</kbd>.</p>
<p>So, if you want to do something like this, you must create a single exec line that executes all the things you want. Besides this, the rebase functionality is fairly simple; it just tries to apply the changes in the order specified in the rebase's to-do list. Git will only apply the changes specified in the list, so if you remove some of them, they will not be applied. This is a way to clean up a feature branch for unwanted commits, for instance, commits that enable you to debug.</p>

<p>When I work with Git, I often create a lot of commits for a single bug fix, but when making the delivery to the remote repository, I preferâand recommendâdelivering the bug fix as one commit. This can be achieved with an interactive rebase, but since this should be a common workflow, Git has a built-in feature called autosquash, which will help you squash the commits together.</p>

<p>Before we begin with this exercise, we will create a branch from <kbd>origin/master</kbd> so we are ready to add commits to our fix.</p>
<p>Let's start with something like this:</p>
<pre><strong>$ git checkout -b readme_update_developer --track origin/master</strong>
<strong>Branch readme_update_developer set up to track remote branch master from origin.</strong>
<strong>Switched to a new branch 'readme_update_developer'</strong></pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>After checking the branch, we will create the first commit that we want to squash other commits to. We need to use the abbreviated commit hash from this commit to automatically create other commits that will squash to this commit by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start by echoing some text into <kbd>README.md</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ echo "More information for developers" &gt;&gt; README.md</strong></pre>
<ol start="2">

<strong>no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</strong></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Now, we want to add and commit this. We can do this with the <kbd>commit</kbd> command using the <kbd>-a</kbd> flag, which will add any unstaged changes to the commit, as shown in the following command:</li>

<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git commit -a -m "Updating information for developers"</strong>

<strong> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</strong></pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>After you create the commit, remember the abbreviated commit hash; we have highlighted it in bold in the command output. The abbreviation will be different in your environment, and you should have your own abbreviation once you finish the exercise.</li>
<li>To continue, we will add three commits to the branch, and we would like to squash two of these with the first commit, as shown in the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ echo "even More information for developers" &gt;&gt; README.md</strong>

<strong> 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)</strong></pre>
<ol start="6">
<li>This is the first commit. Pay attention to why we needed to store the abbreviated hash of the first commitâwe used it with the <kbd>--squash</kbd> option for <kbd>git commit</kbd>. This option will create the commit with the subject of the commit specified. It will also add <kbd>squash!</kbd>Â to the start of the subject. This is to indicate that Git should squash this commit when performing a rebase. Now, create the second commit, as shown in the following command:</li>

<li>We have added two commits that we would like to squash with the first commit. When committing, I also used the <kbd>--no-edit</kbd> option; this skips the opening of the commit's message editor.

Now, we will create the last commit; we don't want to squash this commit:</li>

<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git rebase -i</strong></pre>

<strong>squash d62922d squash! Updating information for developers</strong>
<strong>squash 7d6194d squash! Updating information for developers</strong>
<strong>pick fd07857 Updating information on configuration</strong></pre>

<li>Now close the editor and allow the rebase to start. The editor opens and you can change the commit message for the combined message, as shown in the following command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong># This is a combination of 3 commits.</strong>
<strong># The first commit's message is:</strong>
<strong>Updating information for developers</strong>

<strong># This is the 3rd commit message:</strong>

<li>As expected, we now have two commits on top of the <kbd>origin/master</kbd> commit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Hopefully, this will assist you when you are just making changes and committing them,Â but want to deliver the code as one commit.</p>

<p>If you want to avoid opening the commit message editor, as in step 17 of the <em>Autosquashing commits</em> recipe, you can use <kbd>--fixup=d539645</kbd>. This will use the commit message from the first commit and totally disregard any message written in the commits.</p>
