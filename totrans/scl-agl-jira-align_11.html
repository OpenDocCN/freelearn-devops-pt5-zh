		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Chapter 8</em>: Bimodal Development, Advanced Data Security, and Analytics</h1>
			<p>In this final chapter, we explore some special use cases that may be of interest to organizations that require the tracking of waterfall and agile delivery within the same tool, the advanced <a id="_idIndexMarker479"/>security that on-premises hosting may provide, and advanced <strong class="bold">business intelligence </strong>(<strong class="bold">BI</strong>) capabilities. </p>
			<p>In this chapter we will cover the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Developing products bimodally</li>
				<li>Handling time tracking</li>
				<li>Advanced data security</li>
				<li>Government reporting</li>
				<li>Integrating with BI and other solutions</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of the chapter, you will know how to support bimodal development, report on agile projects to executives who want waterfall style reports, replace legacy time tracking systems with an add-on for Jira Align, host Jira Align on-premises, use an agile approach to earned value that can satisfy reporting requirements for government projects, and integrate with BI and other solutions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Developing products bimodally</h1>
			<p>Garter coined the <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>term <em class="italic">bimodal</em> when advising companies to embrace a more innovative and nimble approach to product delivery. Mode 1 is the traditional approach of waterfall development with long cycle times. The analogy for mode 1 is the marathon runner. Mode 2 represents the newer agile approach to product development, with short cycle times. The analogy for mode 2 is the sprinter. </p>
			<p>Many companies today have not embraced agile throughout their entire organization. Some have agile teams under waterfall management. Others have pure agile in some areas and waterfall in others. Furthermore, agile isn't a "one size fits all" approach. The sweet spot of agile is the realm of the complicated and the complex, when the <em class="italic">what</em> and/or the <em class="italic">how</em> is uncertain or not agreed upon. When what you are developing and how you are going to develop it are both well understood and agreed upon, then waterfall is a great approach. Because of this, Jira Align has been built to accommodate bimodal development.</p>
			<p>There's a helpful adage that comes into play here: you can "<em class="italic">waterfall</em>" an agile tool, but you can't "<em class="italic">agile</em>" a waterfall tool. Thus tools focused on traditional Gantt project schedules and methods are ill-equipped to handle things such as burndown and velocity charts, let alone program boards and OKR trees. We'll now cover some Jira Align features that support bimodal development.</p>
			<p>First, it's important to establish a bimodal operating agreement. This includes a common lexicon, particularly for<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> people, work, time, and outcome definitions. For example, a portfolio practicing agile may be defined as a collection of development value streams while one practicing waterfall may define it as a business unit with its own P&amp;L (profit and loss) statement, or a product line. Likewise, an agile program is a team of agile teams, while a waterfall program may represent the people working on a particular product within a product line.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Work and outcome dimensions</h2>
			<p>For the work<a id="_idIndexMarker482"/> dimension, we recommend using the<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> portfolio <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>epic to<a id="_idIndexMarker485"/> represent a funded project for business units operating in a waterfall model. While agile teams will associate a hypothesis statement with an epic and break it down into features and stories, a waterfall portfolio can associate a business requirements document with the epic. Many companies change "Portfolio Epic" to the more generic term, "Initiative" in <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform Terminology</strong>. In this way, an initiative can represent an epic for agile portfolios and a project for a waterfall portfolio.</p>
			<p>Portfolio epics support several popular waterfall practices such as milestone-based planning and execution. Simply click on a portfolio epic in the backlog to open its details panel and then click on the <strong class="bold">Time / Skills</strong> tab to enter <strong class="bold">Fixed Date Milestones</strong>. On the same tab as shown in the next figure, you can specify the required skill sets to execute work over periods of time, another common waterfall practice:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.1_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1 – Jira Align portfolio epic time/skill tab"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.1 – Jira Align portfolio epic time/skills tab</p>
			<p>Here we<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> see the requested <strong class="bold">member weeks</strong> (<strong class="bold">MW</strong>) for each<a id="_idIndexMarker487"/> skill <a id="_idIndexMarker488"/>set per sprint. You <a id="_idIndexMarker489"/>can <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>manage skill sets by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Manage Skill Sets</strong> button to add or remove skills.</p>
			<p>Next we see the fixed date milestone fields as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Portfolio Ask</strong>: The date that the requestor wants the item to be delivered. This date is not related to the planned or target delivery date by the development team.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start/Initiation</strong>: The projected start date used for strategic planning. This is not the actual start date based on when the first story is done, but rather the date on which the development team intends to begin work. Note that this date is not tied to actual work or time objects.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Target Completion</strong>: The projected completion date used for strategic planning. It is the date on which the development team intends to complete work. Note that this date is not tied to actual work or time objects.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that people add skills to their profiles as we saw in <a href="B16328_03_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Navigating Jira Align</em>, <em class="italic">Figure 3.8</em>. To manage the skills inventory, go to the navigation menu, and select <strong class="bold">Enterprise</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Skills Inventory</strong>. Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Forecast</strong> tab to project the required effort per team, program, and program increment. The unit of measure here is "team weeks," and we'll provide more info on these shortly.</p>
			<p>The portfolio epic status report, financials view that we looked at in <a href="B16328_07_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor118"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Enterprise and Portfolio Challenges</em>, <em class="italic">Figure 7.21</em>, is useful for both agile and waterfall <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>audiences. Aside<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> from <a id="_idIndexMarker493"/>financials, including CapEx and OpEx, it<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> provides popular <strong class="bold">RAG</strong> (<strong class="bold">red</strong>, <strong class="bold">amber</strong>, <strong class="bold">green</strong>) reporting indicators for<a id="_idIndexMarker495"/> budget, people, quality, risk, and schedule.</p>
			<p>For the outcomes dimension, OKRs are common practice across both agile and waterfall development teams. We recommend providing a roadmap to executives used to Gantt charts, and a popular view is to group portfolio epics by OKR. To do so, follow the instructions used for <a href="B16328_07_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor118"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Enterprise and Portfolio Challenges</em>, <em class="italic">Figure 7.17</em>, but select <strong class="bold">Objectives</strong> under <strong class="bold">Group By Property</strong>. We also recommend adding <strong class="bold">Programs</strong> under <strong class="bold">View Configuration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Custom Columns</strong> to provide more context for the portfolio epics shown.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>People and time dimensions</h2>
			<p>For the people <a id="_idIndexMarker496"/>dimension, we recommend that agile<a id="_idIndexMarker497"/> and <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>waterfall<a id="_idIndexMarker499"/> teams roll up to separate portfolios and that portfolios are single mode, not bimodal. However, agile and waterfall teams can still collaborate. Themes are the work item that can span portfolios, so leverage them to consolidate epics from both agile and waterfall portfolios and then generate a theme status report to see the combined data across portfolios. </p>
			<p>To view the theme status report, go to the navigation menu, select <strong class="bold">Enterprise</strong> | <strong class="bold">Track</strong> | <strong class="bold">Status Reports</strong>, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Theme</strong> button. Be sure your context is set in the configuration bar, then click on your theme to view the report where you'll find work item status by portfolio and program. Scan the report for off-track items with red status indicators, then click on an item to drill into its specific status to see risks, dependencies, and other key info.</p>
			<p>For the outcomes dimension, OKRs are common practice across both agile and waterfall development teams. We recommend providing a roadmap to executives used to Gantt charts, and a popular view is to group portfolio epics by OKR. To do so, follow the instructions used for <a href="B16328_07_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor118"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Enterprise and Portfolio Challenges</em>, <em class="italic">Figure 7.17</em>, but select <strong class="bold">Objectives</strong> under <strong class="bold">Group By Property</strong>. We also recommend adding <strong class="bold">Programs</strong> under <strong class="bold">View Configuration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Custom Columns</strong> to provide more context for the portfolio epics shown.</p>
			<p>For the time dimension, we've previously discussed the best practice that all programs in a portfolio follow a common cadence. For an agile portfolio, the program increment is comprised of sprints that sync with Jira Software and represent the shared agile team cadence. For a waterfall portfolio, you can create a program increment with sprints representing the toll gates or phases of a project. These would sync with sprints in Jira Software that have names and dates to match the phases in Jira Align.</p>
			<p>Estimation is the last bimodal aspect we'll cover. Jira Align provides three methods for estimating work items: T-shirt size and points for agile estimation and team weeks for traditional <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>estimation. A <strong class="bold">team week</strong> (<strong class="bold">TW</strong>) is similar to a <strong class="bold">member week</strong> (<strong class="bold">MW</strong>) except that <a id="_idIndexMarker501"/>it relates to the team level rather than the individual. Note that a team week is a measure of time <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>independent of the size of a team. Therefore, if a portfolio epic is<a id="_idIndexMarker503"/> sized at 30 TW, it doesn't <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>matter if it's a team of 5 or 11 members doing <a id="_idIndexMarker505"/>the work, the capacity is still the same. Each portfolio can have its own estimation method. The selection is made in <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Estimation System</strong>.</p>
			<p>Now that we've been introduced to Jira Align's bimodal capabilities, let's take a deeper dive into time tracking.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Handling time tracking</h1>
			<p>While it's helpful for <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>teams at an early stage of agile maturity to break their stories into tasks and provide estimated and actual hours at the task level, time tracking is generally not considered core to agile methods. Since organizations transitioning to agile or operating in a bimodal manner may require time tracking concurrent with agile estimation in story points, Atlassian provides a time tracking module for Jira <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>Align. This goes beyond the roll-up of task hours flowing in from Jira Software to include time cards, booking time against various cost centers, and more. </p>
			<p>The main benefits of <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>handling time tracking in Jira Align are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Submission Governance</strong>: Enforces timesheet submission windows and tracking, useful for regulated businesses and compliance.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">CapEx and OpEx Accounting</strong>: Enables you to categorize investments to optimize company financials.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Output Measurement</strong>: Allows you to measure and report on actual work output. The agile focus on outcomes over outputs doesn't mean that output tracking needs to fall by the wayside.<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p><p class="callout">To find out if your Jira Align instance is enabled to use Time Tracking, go to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Support</strong> | <strong class="bold">Version</strong> and see if <strong class="bold">Time Tracking</strong> is set to <strong class="bold">True</strong>. If not, you can speak with your Atlassian solution partner about licensing your users to use time tracking.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor142"/>Accessing time tracking</h2>
			<p>Access to the time <a id="_idIndexMarker509"/>tracking module is role-based and maintained by the Jira Align administrator under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Access Controls</strong> | <strong class="bold">Roles</strong> | <strong class="bold">Time Tracking Roles</strong> as shown in the next figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.2_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.2 – Jira Align time tracking roles"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.2 – Jira Align time tracking roles</p>
			<p>Here the administrator<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> enables various permission toggles for each of the three default time tracking roles:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Administrator</strong>: Able to configure and manage time tracking settings; the highest level of time tracking permissions.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Approver</strong>: Able to approve timesheets; enabled under the Team time tracking roles permission.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Entry</strong>: Able to enter time; enabled under the Team time tracking roles permission.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that users with the time tracking administrator role have permission to configure <strong class="bold">Time Tracking</strong> and <strong class="bold">Workday</strong> settings, which are accessible by navigating to the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> section.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">The Jira Align administrator can associate time tracking permissions with system roles such as Super Admin by <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>navigating to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Access Controls</strong> | <strong class="bold">Roles</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Align Roles</strong>. However, we recommend maintaining time tracking roles apart from system roles for better maintainability and control.</p>
			<p class="callout">Most organizations find the default roles sufficient for time tracking. However, if you need additional roles such as a view-only role for reporting purposes, your Jira Align administrator can create custom roles with selective permissions by going to the <strong class="bold">Add New Role</strong> section found by scrolling down under the <strong class="bold">Time Tracking Roles</strong> section shown in <em class="italic">Figure 8.2</em>.</p>
			<p>Now that time tracking roles are configured, let's see how the Jira Align administrator grants access to the time tracking module.</p>
			<p>To provide access, the Jira Align administrator adds a time tracking role to each user account as shown in the next figure. Note that red squares indicate required fields and that you'll need to scroll down to see all options:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.3_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.3 – Jira Align time tracking user account settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.3 – Jira Align time tracking user account settings</p>
			<p>Here the following<a id="_idIndexMarker512"/> time tracking user settings are maintained:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">View time tracking settings</strong>: Enable the time tracking module. The selected user region needs to be enabled under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Workday</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Include Hours</strong>: Specify whether to include or exclude the user's hours in your financial system. For example, you can choose to disregard time entries for non-billable users.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User Is a Manager</strong>: You may set the user as a manager so they will appear in the <strong class="bold">Manager</strong> dropdown field for other users.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manager</strong>: Select the user's manager from the list or choose the option <strong class="bold">Manager is not in Jira Align</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Tracking Start Date</strong>: Specify the start date for time tracking; required for users with time entry permission.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Approver</strong>: Select a user with the time approver role to approve the user's time, for example, the scrum master of their team; required for users with time entry permission.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Holiday Calendar</strong>: Select an applicable holiday region.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Holiday City</strong>: Select an <a id="_idIndexMarker513"/>applicable holiday city.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Compliance Manager</strong>: Slide this toggle on to indicate that the user is a compliance manager, for example, someone who approves time tracking during audits.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Tracking Roles</strong>: Select the applicable time tracking roles for the user: <strong class="bold">Time Administrator</strong>, <strong class="bold">Time Approver</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Time Entry</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Tracking Settings</strong>: Choose an employee classification for the user: <strong class="bold">Full Time</strong>, <strong class="bold">Part Time</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Contractor</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that users have been granted access to time tracking, they'll have a stopwatch icon near the bottom of the navigation menu as shown in the next figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.4_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.4 – Jira Align time tracking module&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.4 – Jira Align time tracking module</p>
			<p>Based on how the time tracking roles were configured in <em class="italic">Figure 8.2</em>, users will have access to views accessible by clicking on the buttons along the top left of the workspace: <strong class="bold">Time Entry</strong>, <strong class="bold">Time Approval</strong>, <strong class="bold">Time Projects</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Reports</strong>. </p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Figure 8.4</em>, we've<a id="_idIndexMarker514"/> clicked on the <strong class="bold">Reports</strong> button to show the reports configured for the user's time tracking role. Let's take a moment to learn about the key time tracking reports and the filters they provide:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Submission Metrics</strong>: Provides a dashboard of time tracking metrics so you can determine when to perform data extracts and manage outstanding items within your organization. You can filter your report based on the time submission metrics, which include time period, additional filters, and employee classification.</li>
				<li><code>.xls</code> document. You can filter your report based on the time period, enterprise hierarchy, time approver, manager, contractor manager, user, user cost center, time project cost center, and time project name.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">PTO Export</strong>: Shows the <strong class="bold">personal time off</strong> (<strong class="bold">PTO</strong>) taken by team members within the organization. You <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>can filter your report based on the time period, administration code, or enterprise hierarchy, and you can group by manager or contractor manager.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Project Closure Export</strong>: Shows the time projects that are complete and can be closed each month. You can filter your report based on the year and month.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Timesheet Export</strong>: Allows you to export timesheets for users within your organization. You can filter your report based on the time period, or filter by user or user-related filters.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project Attributes Export</strong>: Shows a<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> list of time projects and their details. You can filter your report based on the time project type, time project owner, display name, time period dates, enterprise hierarchy, cost center, modified by, modified date range, capitalization, and work codes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User Attributes Export</strong>: Shows a filtered list of Jira Align users along with their attributes so that you can compare users against a system of record. You can filter your report based on the user start date range, and all user-related properties.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">No "Launched Date" Export</strong>: Shows any time projects that are past their Expected Completion date and do not have a <strong class="bold">Launched</strong> date. You can filter your report based on the owner, year, and month.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Timesheet Compliance Export</strong>: Shows the compliance metrics for groups within your organization so that you can be sure that time is submitted and approved on time and your team members are in compliance. You can filter your report based on the time period, compliance, enterprise hierarchy, group by manager, time tracker, or time approver, and roll up results to the enterprise hierarchy.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we've learned<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> how to configure and assign time tracking roles and been introduced to reporting, let's see how to configure time tracking and workday settings.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor143"/>Configuring time tracking</h2>
			<p>As previously<a id="_idIndexMarker518"/> mentioned, users with the time tracking administrator role have permission to configure time tracking and workday settings, which are accessible by navigating to the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> section. In the next figure, we are viewing the <strong class="bold">Time Tracking Settings</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.5_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.5 – Jira Align time tracking settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.5 – Jira Align time tracking settings</p>
			<p>Here, the time <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>tracking administrator can view and configure the following settings. Note that you will need to scroll down to see all options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fiscal Year Start</strong>: Set the start of your organization's 12-month accounting period. This may vary based on the country you operate in; for example, the UK fiscal year starts in April.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time Tracking Week</strong>: Specify when a week starts and ends. This impacts time tracking periods, timesheets, and data exports. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">General Settings for Email Notifications</strong>: Toggle on email notifications for users to receive when timesheets are approved, rejected, and recalled.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time submission and approval compliance</strong>: Set compliance rules for when timesheets should be submitted and approved. This allows you to report against any outstanding timesheets.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time tracking terminology</strong>: Configure your time tracking terminology to match your organization's processes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">General time tracking settings</strong>: Create and associate custom time-tracking tasks. For example, create a task set for meetings and add time tracking tasks for<a id="_idIndexMarker520"/> planning, stand-ups, demo, and retrospective. Additionally, manage the number of flexible holidays for each region and enable the ability to record time in the future. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">General time tracking settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Time Approvers</strong>: Set the scope for time approval; for example, the approver can approve any time tracker or only those within their enterprise hierarchy. Additionally, you can require approvers to be internal employees, excluding contractors. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">General time tracking settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Administration Codes</strong>: Associate administrator time codes with cost centers and/or operating work codes. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">General time tracking settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Time Projects</strong>: Associate time projects with release vehicles, portfolio epics, or stand-alone time projects. Enable cost center, identification code, and product fields. Enable editing of the launch date after it has passed. Automatically close launched time projects and set a warning when a time project is past its due date.<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p><p class="callout">Associating time with portfolio epics can help facilitate CapEx and OpEx time reporting. To do so, obtain licenses for your Jira Software users to enter their time in Jira Align's time tracking module. </p><p class="callout">We recommend exploring a combination of Jira Software and marketplace apps if you require time tracking and reporting at any level below the portfolio epic.</p><p class="callout">To account for time not associated with a portfolio epic or release vehicle, for example, time spent on support activities, associate time with a stand-alone time project in Jira Align.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Time tracking periods</strong>: Set the periods for which time will be tracked. Lock completed time periods so that data can be extracted and loaded into a financial system.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Administration codes</strong>: Create internal work codes used for company holidays, personal<a id="_idIndexMarker521"/> time off, sick leave, jury duty, and so on. The codes can be associated with an employee classification and will appear on the user's timesheet.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Custom employee classifications</strong>: Manage employee classifications like full time, part-time, and contractor, and add additional classifications. Most custom time tracking configurations are based on employee classifications.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Blended rates</strong>: Set blended rates based on employee classifications to obtain accurate accounting from the system. Rates are per hour and can be set as a single rate, by region, or by role.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Manage identification codes and work codes</strong>: Manage time tracking identification codes and work codes. To view the codes, you need to do a search first.<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p><p class="callout">Permission to manage work codes is granted per system role.

			</ul>
			<p>Now that we've <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>examined the time tracking settings, let's take a look at workday settings where you set your employee work hours and company holidays per region. This is important because access to time tracking is enabled based on the region. You can further refine settings based on specific cities as shown in the next figure:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.6 – Jira Align workday settings</p>
			<p>Now that we've<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> seen how to configure time tracking and workday settings, let's take a look at how to manage timesheets.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor144"/>Managing timesheets</h2>
			<p>Let's begin by<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> creating a time project. To do so, go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Time Tracking</strong>. Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Time Projects</strong> button near the top left corner of the workspace and then click on the <strong class="bold">Add Time Project</strong> button at the top right corner to open the panel shown in the next figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.7_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.7 – Jira Align time project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.7 – Jira Align time project</p>
			<p>Here we will create <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>a stand-alone time tracking project and track the following attributes. Note that red squares indicate required fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Owner</strong>: Select a user as the responsible owner for the time project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Type</strong>: Specify whether the time project is stand-alone or pertains to a portfolio epic or release vehicle. Here we will create a <strong class="bold">Stand-alone</strong> time project. Note that if you select <strong class="bold">Portfolio Epic </strong>or <strong class="bold">Release Vehicle</strong>, a search box appears for you to select the associated item. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Display Name</strong>: Provide a meaningful name for your time project. This will be displayed in the timesheets for time entry.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Task Set</strong>: Select the task set template with associated time task breakdown.</li>
				<li><code>Yes</code> if the time project requires approval. </li>
				<li><code>Inactive</code> or <code>Active</code>. Setting to <strong class="bold">Active</strong> allows you to set a time project state.</li>
				<li><code>Not Started</code>, <code>Started</code>, <code>Launched</code>, <code>Closed</code>, or <code>Cancelled</code>. It is required to move the status to <code>Started</code> in order for the time project to appear on timesheets. Moving the status to <code>Launched</code> ensures that the <code>Launched Date</code> field is populated and locks the time entry on CapEx cost category tasks. Moving the status to <code>Closed</code> or <code>Cancelled</code> sets the time project status to <code>Inactive</code> and will populate the <code>Closed/Cancelled</code> date field and time entry on timesheets will be closed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start Date</strong>: Add a start date for the time project and timesheet entry.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Expected Completion Date</strong>: Add an end date for the time project and timesheet entry.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Allow Capitalization</strong>: Specify if the CapEx work code is allowed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Operating Work Code</strong>: Provide OpEx work codes.</li>
				<li><code>Yes</code>, then provide CapEx work codes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Programs</strong>: Select the programs applicable to the time project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Teams</strong>: Select the teams applicable to the time project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Billable</strong>: Specify if the time project is billable.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer</strong>: Select a customer to associate with the time project.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Save &amp; Close</strong> button to create the time project. The users of a team who belong to the time project can now add time against it. To do so, they'd go to the navigation menu, select <strong class="bold">Time Tracking</strong>, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Time Entry</strong> button to open the time entry workspace shown in the next screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.8_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.8 – Jira Align time entry&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.8 – Jira Align time entry</p>
			<p>Here we see that time<a id="_idIndexMarker527"/> is logged against the time project associated with a portfolio epic, "Artificial Intelligence for Improved Call Center Interactions." Note the associated task set, with tasks categorized as <strong class="bold">Operating</strong> expense or <strong class="bold">Capitalized</strong>. The submission deadline based on the compliance rules in the time tracking settings displays above the timesheet on the right.</p>
			<p>Navigate between the weekly timesheets using the <strong class="bold">Select Week</strong> panel along the right side of the workspace. On the top-right toolbar, click on the <strong class="bold">Save Time</strong> button to save time entries or on the <strong class="bold">Save &amp; Submit Time</strong> button to submit a timesheet. Click on the <strong class="bold">Recall Time</strong> button to recall a submitted timesheet or on the <strong class="bold">Submitted Timesheets</strong> button to view all submitted timesheets.</p>
			<p>Next, let's take a look at approving timesheets. As a time approver, you will receive your team's timesheet submissions for your approval as shown in the next figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.9_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.9 – Jira Align time approval&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.9 – Jira Align time approval</p>
			<p>You will see all timesheet<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> submissions filtered for the current week, and you can switch weeks using the dropdown near the top left corner of the workspace. Click on the <strong class="bold">Approve</strong> or <strong class="bold">Reject</strong> buttons to act on the timesheet approvals. You may choose to include a comment when approving or rejecting a timesheet to inform the user of the next action. Click on the <strong class="bold">Approve</strong><strong class="bold"> All</strong> button to approve all timesheets for a given week. Below that button, note the approval deadline based on the compliance rules set in the time tracking settings. </p>
			<p>The quick filter dropdown near the top right corner of the workspace allows you to filter timesheets based on status: <strong class="bold">Open</strong>, <strong class="bold">Submitted</strong>, <strong class="bold">Recalled</strong>, <strong class="bold">Rejected</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Approved</strong>. If you are not available to approve timesheets, you can delegate the time approver task to a fellow time approver by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Assign Delegates</strong> button at the top right corner of the workspace.</p>
			<p>Now that we have learned the details of time tracking and how it supports an organization's finance and accounting reporting, let's see how Jira Align supports advanced data security.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Advanced data security</h1>
			<p>Jira Align is a <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>highly<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> secure, cloud-based <strong class="bold">SaaS</strong> (<strong class="bold">software as a service</strong>) product. Atlassian takes a standards-based approach to security and holds industry-accepted certifications. Atlassian holds SOC 2 Type 2 and SOC 3 certifications that are validated by external third-party audits over an extended period. Details including the auditors' report can be found at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/trust/compliance">https://www.atlassian.com/trust/compliance</a>.</p>
			<p>Atlassian's Trust Center is the source for everything compliance-related and can be found at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/trust">https://www.atlassian.com/trust</a>. For security-related questions, Atlassian has completed a <a id="_idIndexMarker531"/>generic <strong class="bold">Consensus Assessments Initiative Questionnaire</strong> (<strong class="bold">CAIQ</strong>) published by the Cloud Security Alliance. Full details of the CAIQ can be found at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/vendor-security-risk-response">https://www.atlassian.com/trust/security/vendor-security-risk-response</a>.</p>
			<p>Atlassian uses <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) and <strong class="bold">Microsoft Azure</strong> to provide physical <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>safeguards, environmental safeguards, infrastructure support and management, and storage services. Furthermore, as we discuss next, you can select one of two deployment options depending on your security needs. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>SaaS deployment</h2>
			<p>The standard SaaS <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>deployment option for Jira Align uses common data architecture patterns of multi-tenant database applications that run in a <strong class="bold">virtual private cloud</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPC</strong>) environment. The multi-tenant VPCs have an underlying SQL structure that separates each Jira Align customer's data on the database service into separated data stores. </p>
			<p>By customer request, Atlassian can create "dedicated" VPCs, meaning that the VPC network is not shared with other customers, to essentially provide a dedicated database for additional security. This approach also allows customer-managed keys for encryption at rest, the ability to audit at will, penetration testing, and improved capacity overhead.</p>
			<p>There is another option to consider for organizations requiring the utmost in security, which we discuss next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>On-premises deployment</h2>
			<p>Even with the industry-recognized SOC 2 Type 2 Audit, CAIQ, and trust overview, there are organizations that require the highest level of security. As recently as 2016, some large Fortune 500 companies were reluctant to use the standard SaaS deployment and opted instead to host Jira Align on-premises. The on-premises option carries a higher price tag and requires that the organization's own tools team apply the upgrades that Jira Align releases every two weeks. The added licensing and internal maintenance costs can add up. We've therefore seen the same Fortune 500 companies move to the SaaS product within three years.</p>
			<p>Yet there are some organizations that may never be comfortable with the cloud. Government agencies such as the U.S. <strong class="bold">Department of Defense</strong> (<strong class="bold">DoD</strong>), a customer of Jira Align and of SAFe, host Jira Align on-premises so it's likely to remain an option into the foreseeable future. Agile practices and the tools to support them have been gaining in popularity among government organizations in recent years.</p>
			<p>Organizations that <a id="_idIndexMarker534"/>provide contract services to the government are also candidates for a scaled agile approach. SAFe as a methodology and Jira Align as a tool both support earned value reporting as mandated by government contracts, which we examine next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Government reporting</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Earned value management</strong> (<strong class="bold">EVM</strong>) is a <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>methodology that <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>integrates scope, time, and costs to objectively measure performance and progress. Performance is measured by determining the budgeted cost of work performed, also <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>known as <strong class="bold">earned value</strong> (<strong class="bold">EV</strong>), and comparing it to<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> the <strong class="bold">actual cost</strong> (<strong class="bold">AC</strong>) of work performed. Progress is measured by<a id="_idIndexMarker539"/> comparing the EV with the <strong class="bold">planned value</strong> (<strong class="bold">PV</strong>).</p>
			<p>Two other important EVM<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> measures are the <strong class="bold">cost performance index</strong> (<strong class="bold">CPI</strong>) and <strong class="bold">schedule performance index </strong>(<strong class="bold">SPI</strong>). CPI is the ratio of earned value to <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>actual costs (EV divided by AC). SPI is the ratio of earned value to planned value (EV divided by PV).</p>
			<p>Government use of EVM originated with the DoD in the 1960s and continues to this day with many agencies required to use it by law. Some agencies provide guidance for contractors using EVM with agile delivery methods and numerous SAFe for government resources are available online. It's no surprise then that Jira Align offers agile EVM reporting. </p>
			<p>To get started, be sure your Jira Align administrator has populated the EVM fields under <code>Web</code> program and <code>PI-5</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.10_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.10 – Jira Align earned value report&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.10 – Jira Align earned value report</p>
			<p>The chart represents all <a id="_idIndexMarker542"/>portfolio epics and standalone features in the portfolio for <code>PI-5</code>, with team weeks on the vertical axis and weeks of the PI on the horizontal axis.</p>
			<p>The chart shows team weeks completed against team weeks scheduled. Unlike a burndown chart, this report captures cost information, enabling you to validate whether teams can complete all of the work planned for the PI within both schedule and budget.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Team Weeks Completed</strong> is calculated <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>as the sum of all team weeks on accepted portfolio epics and standalone features on each day of the PI. <strong class="bold">Team Weeks Scheduled</strong> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker544"/> sum of all team weeks on all portfolio epics and standalone features scheduled in the PI, expressed as an ideal upward trend from the PI start date to the PI finish date. Ideally, the team weeks completed line would closely match the team weeks scheduled line.</p>
			<p>Note the SPI and CPI measures above the chart to the left. Values equal to or greater than one indicate a favorable condition and are shown in green. Values less than one indicate an unfavorable condition and are shown in red. There are many more EVM metrics available by scrolling down in the workspace.</p>
			<p>Now that we've seen<a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> how Jira Align can meet the needs of government reporting, let's see how its data can be leveraged for advanced analytics.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Integrating with BI and other solutions</h1>
			<p>Jira Align is a solution<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> that provides something for everyone at each level of<a id="_idIndexMarker547"/> scale. There are over 165 reports from the enterprise to team levels. And yet, there are inevitably unique analytical needs at every organization that can luckily be met with an add-on for Jira Align called Enterprise Insights.</p>
			<p>If you are looking for specific insights that the standard report set does not offer, Enterprise Insights allows you to connect to data in Jira Align using your current BI tools (Power BI, Tableau, and so on) in a highly structured, tabular data model. This enables you to explore advanced analytics, KPIs, and metrics from either Jira Align alone, or in combination with data from across your organization. With Enterprise Insights, your team can focus on analytics and reporting rather than on complex data integration and transformation efforts. It leverages your existing data visualization capabilities and ensures that your transactional Jira Align system performance is not affected while positioning the big queries including machine learning on a dedicated data warehouse as shown in the next figure:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.11_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.11 – Jira Align Enterprise Insights&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.11 – Jira Align Enterprise Insights</p>
			<p>The Enterprise Insights<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> data warehouse and tabular semantic models are built on <a id="_idIndexMarker549"/>the Azure platform. The warehouse receives data from Jira Align via an <strong class="bold">ETL</strong> (<strong class="bold">extract</strong>, <strong class="bold">transform</strong>, and <strong class="bold">load</strong>) process. Connection <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>to Enterprise Insights is made from your existing BI solution via Azure SSO, SQL Auth, and a REST API. The BI solution enables visualization of dashboards and reports from multiple systems connecting your organization's enterprise data lake in real time to make successful business decisions.</p>
			<p>You can speak with your Atlassian solution partner to begin your journey with Enterprise Insights. Let's now take a look at other ways you can integrate Jira Align with critical business systems.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Integrating via APIs</h2>
			<p>Jira Align <a id="_idIndexMarker551"/>offers a <strong class="bold">representational state transfer</strong> (<strong class="bold">REST</strong>) <strong class="bold">application programming interface</strong> (<strong class="bold">API</strong>) that exposes key objects in the people, work, time, and outcomes<a id="_idIndexMarker552"/> dimensions. The REST API allows you to <a id="_idIndexMarker553"/>perform most actions available through the Jira Align user interface, as well as simplify user management, mass update work objects, and develop integrations between Jira Align and other critical business applications.</p>
			<p>You can obtain access to the complete REST API documentation in your Jira Align instance using the URL <code>https://ORGANIZATION-NAME.jiraalign.com/rest/align/api/docs/index.html</code>, where <code>ORGANIZATION-NAME</code> is replaced by your organization's subdomain. The next figure shows the REST API documentation that provides access to the latest version of the Jira Align REST resources, along with HTTP responses and sample requests:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.12_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.12 – Jira Align REST API&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.12 – Jira Align REST API</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">Jira Align's REST API is behind a feature flag and inaccessible by default. If you are interested in using the REST API, speak with your Atlassian solution partner or contact the Atlassian support team to enable it in your Jira Align instance.</p>
			<p>The <code>https://ORGANIZATION-NAME.jiraalign.com/rest/align/api/2/&lt;resource-name&gt;</code>. The REST API uses JSON (JavaScript Object <a id="_idIndexMarker555"/>Notation) as its communication format, and the standard <strong class="bold">HTTP</strong> (<strong class="bold">Hypertext Transfer Protocol</strong>) methods like GET, PUT, POST, and PATCH. Jira Aligns's REST APIs provide access to resources (data entities) via URI paths. To use a REST API, your other business applications will make an HTTP request and parse the response.</p>
			<p>The Jira Align REST API 2.0 supports the following object types: theme, portfolio epic, capability, feature, story, task, defect, objectives, key results, portfolio, value streams, program, team, user, release/PI, sprint, product, customer, region, city, and ideation. Read more about the Jira Align REST API by going to the user menu, selecting <strong class="bold">Help</strong> | <strong class="bold">Knowledge Base</strong> | <strong class="bold">Integrations</strong> | <strong class="bold">10X: API 2.0</strong>, and then clicking on <strong class="bold">Getting started with the REST API 2.0</strong>.</p>
			<p>The REST authorization is based on the authenticated user and it authenticates using API tokens. The tokens are generated by going to the user menu, <strong class="bold">Edit Profile</strong> page, and then clicking on the <strong class="bold">API Token</strong> button as follows: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_8.13_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 8.13 – Jira Align API token&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 8.13 – Jira Align API token</p>
			<p>When REST APIs are<a id="_idIndexMarker556"/> called, access privileges mirror the user's access to data and pages via the user interface. For example, if the user is assigned the <strong class="bold">Team Member</strong> role and has read-only access to portfolio epics in a single portfolio, the user will not be able to create or update portfolio epics via the API and will only be able to read portfolio epics from the single portfolio.</p>
			<p>Jira Align APIs are rate-limited to ensure that they don't affect platform performance and that the instance remains stable. Currently, if calls from the same IP address exceed 600 requests per 60 seconds, calls are blocked for 60 seconds. When this threshold is met and calls are blocked, you'll receive the HTTP <strong class="bold">429 Too Many Requests</strong> error status response. It is recommended to use industry-standard techniques for limiting calls, caching results, and re-trying requests responsibly. </p>
			<p>Atlassian is continually investing in the future bringing more REST API capabilities that may extend its REST<a id="_idIndexMarker557"/> to the object attributes such as fields and so on.</p>
