                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Managing Work Items</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In the previous chapter, we learned about what JIRA is, how to get started with it, and how to create a project in JIRA. In this chapter, we're going to learn about managing all of the work items that we have. Let's go ahead and get started.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we'll be learning about epics, stories, bugs, and tasks, what each of these things are, and how we would use and create them in an Agile project. Then, we're going to learn about issue type attributes. We're going to talk about adding and removing them, and making them really customized to fit the type of work that we're doing in JIRA.  Then, we're going to learn about managing the items in our backlog, and then we're going to learn about our board (for those of us that do Scrum, we are going to feel very comfortable with the board), and how to configure it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we will learn about the following topics:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="mce-root1">Introduction to epics, stories, bugs, and tasks</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Issue type attributes and adding and removing them</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Managing items in the backlog</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Creating and configuring our board</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Introduction to epics, stories, bugs, and tasks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4">Epics</strong>, as you might imagine, are large stories. It's important that they have a distinct start and end, just like any story. We want them to be able to be completed, which means that they are going to need some sort of end. We like to think of epics as something that would span multiple sprints, versus a story, which would really be completed within a Sprint. Epics are not groupings of work items, and we'll take a look at that because that's a common thing that people do in a JIRA UX. We'll take a look at how we use components and labels to do this instead of epics. Epics will contain stories, bugs, and tasks, and they're really a grouping of those things, which is again a large story.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Stories are smaller than epics. Stories, bugs, and tasks are all the same level hierarchically; they're all things that could be prioritized against one another within our backlog. Stories are also known as <strong class="calibre4">user stories</strong>, and they're called that because the intent is that they will focus on users, we need to think about new functionality for whatever this is, and we need to make sure that we're continuing to think about the people that we're building it for. That's why they call them stories or user stories.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Bugs are what we call defects, and they occur when there's a problem. In JIRA, something will always prioritize against a new feature, and we know that we should take into account either, <em class="calibre8">do we want to take the time in this Sprint to fix something, or do we want to create something new?</em> We should be prioritizing those two things and pitting them against one another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A subtask is something we'll take a look at quickly. If we have multiple people working on a story or a bug and we want to assign it a more granular level of detail, we can use a subtask.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating epics, stories, bugs, and tasks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">To learn about epics, let's go to our projects. We created our First Project and Second Project in the previous chapter.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The following are the necessary steps to create an epic in a project:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="mce-root1">Click on the First Project that we created in our JIRA account. </li>
<li value="2" class="mce-root1"> Within our project, we can see that we have the Backlog view. In this view, we have three stories. We can see on the side of the following panel that we have versions and we have epics. Click on EPICS:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00033.jpeg" class="calibre43"/></div>
<ol start="3" class="calibre13">
<li value="3" class="mce-root1">We can see in the previous figure that we don't have any epics. We'll create an epic and we'll call this epic <kbd class="calibre12">My Test Epic</kbd>. In the summary, we can insert information regarding what the epic is about. Let's go ahead and create it. We need a summary, which we'll call <kbd class="calibre12">This is a summary</kbd>. We now have a test epic:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00034.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Let's take a look at this epic. We can see that if we look at it on the left here that we can expand and contract the epic. It has a JIRA ID:</p>
<div><img src="img/00035.jpeg" class="calibre44"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can select the color that we want to use for it and we can edit the name, the epic details, and mark it as done:</p>
<div><img src="img/00036.jpeg" class="calibre45"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">More importantly, underneath the epic, we can see how many issues or stories, bugs, or tasks are contained underneath this epic. We can also see how many are completed, unestimated, and how many are estimated. At the bottom, we can see a status bar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We will create our backlog items and then <em class="calibre8">drag</em> those into our epic, and that's how we assign them to the epic. This epic is a story, it's a big story, but it's something that can be started and finished. It's important that this is not just a grouping, as that's not the intent of an epic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we want to group items in JIRA, that's a slightly different thing, and for that  what we can do is we can use components to do that:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="mce-root1">Select Components from the options on the left-hand side.</li>
<li value="2" class="mce-root1">We'll create one component because we don't have one. Let's call this <kbd class="calibre12">My Test Component</kbd>, and, so we don't get an error again, we will use the same value that's in the description. We can select a Component lead, and also a Default assignee, who will basically be the same person that is assigned to the project by default:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00037.jpeg" class="calibre46"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can use the component that we've created in order to group items together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's have a look at how to create a story.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We can see that we have three stories. We'll go ahead and create a new one. We'll call this <kbd class="calibre12">The newest story</kbd>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We can see that when we're actually creating the stories that we have the option to create a story, a task, or a bug, and that they're all ranked the same hierarchically within JIRA:</p>
<p>A story generally represents a piece of new functionality, a task is just something that needs to be done, and a bug is something that's broken that needs to be fixed.</p>
<div><img src="img/00038.jpeg" class="calibre47"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We'll create a new story, create the newest task, and then we'll create the newest bug, and that way we have all three. We can take a look at them in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00039.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Backlog view</p>
<p class="calibre2">When we select one of these items, a preview pane on the right-side will show us details about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The other thing that we will look into is that when we select an item in this Backlog view, we can actually hit the <em class="calibre8">E</em> key on our keyboard, and it will prompt an edit. This is just a nice little shortcut. Another thing to note is that if we select an item and it's unassigned, we can actually hit the <em class="calibre8">A</em> button on our keyboard and it will prompt us to assign an item.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The last thing we'll look at in this particular section is how we create a subtask. If we've got our newest story on the preview pane, we can see that we've got the ability to add an attachment, an ability to link an item, to link to multiple items together and create dependencies, and then we have this creative subtask option:</p>
<div><img src="img/00040.jpeg" class="calibre48"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Again, we might use the subtask if this story is going to need to be worked on by multiple people and if we really want to have more granularity around what each person's going to do. We can click Create subtask, and as we can see in the following screenshot, in the bottom right corner there's a prompt. We can say <kbd class="calibre12">This is my subtask</kbd>, and we can create it:</p>
<div><img src="img/00041.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Create Subtask</p>
<p class="calibre2">Subtasks allow us to use multiple different items of work that exist underneath a story.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we learned about epics, stories, bugs, and tasks. In the next section, we're going to talk about issue type attributes. We're going to look at each of the different attributes that are available underneath the different issue types in more detail, and then we're going to talk about adding and removing them so that they fit our work better.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Issue type attributes and adding and removing them</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to cover issue type attributes, how to add them, and how to remove them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">First, we're going to learn what the different kinds of attributes are that can be assigned to stories, tasks, and bugs. Then, we're going to talk more about how we can customize them  and adjust the screen so that we can only see the ones that we want to see.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The different type of work item attributes (stories, bugs, and tasks) are all JIRA work items.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The following are the attributes that are available to us:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="mce-root1">Assignee: This is the person that is assigned to use that item.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Attachments: These are anything that need to be attached to that item to provide more clarity or show that it's been done.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Comments: To add our views.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Component/s: These are groupings, and are used to group items together.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Description: This is an epic link.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Epic link: We talked about how epics are effectively a large story in the last section. We would use this if we were looking at the story that the epic is associated with.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Fixed version/s: This is a large group of functionality that is released at once. If the story, bug, or task is part of a version, it would be there.</li>
<li class="mce-root1"> Issue type: This is a story, bug, or task.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Labels: These are like components but are a way to group items across projects.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Linked issues: This is a way in which we can create a dependency between different issues if something depends on something else, or if it's blocked by something else.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Priority: This is slightly obvious. We can choose from high, medium, or low priority, and we'll use different priority statuses in JIRA.</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Sprint: Is the work item contained within a Sprint, and if so, which Sprint?</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Let's take a look at JIRA and some of these work item attributes:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="mce-root1">We've got the newest story that we created earlier. We'll press the <em class="calibre21">E</em> key on our keyboard, or we can use the three ellipses in the top-right-hand corner to go into edit mode:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00042.jpeg" class="calibre49"/></div>
<ol start="2" class="calibre13">
<li value="2" class="mce-root1">We're looking at issue FP1-29. This is our newest story. We can see in the following screenshot that as we move down the screen, we've got the ability to change the issue type from Story to Task, Bug, or Epic:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00043.jpeg" class="calibre50"/></div>
<p>Issue type attributes and adding and removing them</p>
<p class="calibre28">In the last section, we created a component that we might remember. We can actually look for that component here. If we want to use this, we've got <kbd class="calibre12">My test component</kbd>, which allows us to group these items together:</p>
<div><img src="img/00044.jpeg" class="calibre51"/></div>
<p>Grouping of items</p>
<p class="calibre28">The description has a rich text editor, which is nice. We've got Fix Version/s, which basically allows us to determine which release this is going to be in. A version is something that we eventually release. We also have a Priority here, and we have already talked about the priority being High, Medium, Low, and more. Labels, which are groupings across projects, are something we can actually look for just by selecting them, and we can also create new ones. If we use <kbd class="calibre12">cross-project-label</kbd>, we can see that we have one, we can go ahead and assign that label. We can use Attachments by dragging and dropping them, or we can browse. In Linked Issues, we can link the issue to another issue. There's a variety of ways we can link to things, either by using blocks, is blocked by, clones, is cloned by, duplicates, and more. Then, we can type in the issue here, and we can actually perform a search in real time. We can assign this issue to someone else or to ourself. We can assign the epic, and we can assign what sprint it should appear in, and we can also actually assign epics and sprints by dragging and dropping them:</p>
<div><img src="img/00045.jpeg" class="calibre52"/></div>
<p class="calibre28">Then, we've got our rich text editor (again for comments) so that we can see the different fields that we have available to us. The other thing that we should note here is the Configure fields option in the upper right corner. Sometimes, we're not going to use a lot of these fields and we might use them all, but there's a chance we're not going to be using some of them.</p>
<ol start="3" class="calibre13">
<li value="3" class="mce-root1">If we select the Configure fields option, we can see that we have the ability to turn them all on and off, and we can even select the Custom field and uncheck the Comment field. When we save these changes, we'll see that this is the case for the items that we make go forward when we view them:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00046.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Configure fields</p>
<ol start="4" class="calibre13">
<li value="4" class="mce-root1">Let's take a look at this preview pane in a little more detail; let's take a look at each of the items. We've got the ability to watch or unwatch an item:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00047.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Preview pane</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is helpful if we have multiple people on our project and we want someone to be notified if the status of this item changes. We can see that we're a watcher on this item, and this is really because it's assigned to us and we've reported it as well. We can see that it's actually unassigned, but it's been reported by us. That automatically makes us a watcher. If we remember our notifications workflow from the previous section that we went through, we've got our label that we created, we've got a status on this to-do in progress, and more, such as the ability to link an item, attachment, and subtasks. We can also perform a story point assignment, where we can look at the components, priorities, and reporters. We can also show more or less items. We can see that this actually contains time-tracking and things like subtask comments.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We get a lot of this through the preview pane, which is really convenient as we don't actually have to end up leaving the screen to do a lot of modifications. Some of these fields will not be editable once we pull them into a Sprint; once this story enters a Sprint, we're not going to be able to change some of these values. We'll take a look at this when we create a Sprint later.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the next section, we're going to talk about managing those items in the backlog. We've got these items and we've assigned all of these attributes, so we're going to need to be able to manage them, prioritize them, and more.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Managing items in the backlog</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to learn about managing the items in our backlog.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Here, we will learn about the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="mce-root1">How to create items</li>
<li class="mce-root1">How to prioritize items</li>
<li class="mce-root1">How to assign items into epics and versions</li>
<li class="mce-root1">How to create and use quick filters in our board view</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Separating work that's fully refined and ready for a Sprint</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Let's go back to our backlog. We can see that we've got our items. It's really easy to prioritize these items in JIRA. All we have to do is basically drag and drop them. This means that we can move these items around in any way we want to, and that makes it really easy for our product owners to just move all this stuff around exactly how they want.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We made an epic previously, and as we can see in the following screenshot, we've got My Test Epic. We want to assign some items to this, maybe all of the newest items, which is fine. Let's take the first story (that is, The newest story), drag it over to our epic, and once we do that we'll get a message. We can also see that we have an issue assigning this on our epic:</p>
<div><img src="img/00048.jpeg" class="calibre53"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Let's go ahead and take the bug and the task. We can move these items over as well so that we have three items in our epic. We selected multiple items by just holding down the <em class="calibre8">Shift</em> key:</p>
<div><img src="img/00049.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Adding items to Epic</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, we've got what's called versions, and we can see here that this would be an increment of value that we would release to either our customers, to our market, or to something similar. In most cases, we'll use versions as a way to track the amount of work that's been completed in a month, in a week, or in a Sprint. So, here, we can go back and report on that:</p>
<div><img src="img/00050.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Managing items in the backlog</p>
<p class="calibre2">A version is a little bit different from an epic. We may have multiple epics inside a version, or we may just have one epic inside a version. We can see that in the preceding screenshot we have links to issues without versions, and issues without epics. These two may be related, but they're also not necessarily hierarchically connected. A version is a way for us to group work together and, as we can see, if we take a look at Releases, ultimately a version is something that we're going to release. As we can see in the following screenshot, we have version 2 and 3, which have been unreleased:</p>
<div><img src="img/00051.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Releases</p>
<p class="calibre2">We can select these items and we can take a look at the items that appear underneath them. All default items that were in JIRA when we created this project are as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/00052.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Releases version</p>
<p class="calibre2">We can see that this gives we a nice view of things that are in the version, how much has been done, and how much is in progress. Once this is complete, we can hit the Release button, and we can actually release this version. That's what makes this version so powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre2"> Going back to our backlog again, we can see that it's fairly easy to take the items and assign them to a version as well, and we can see that we've got some visual confirmation that these are in an epic. If we drag them over and put them inside a version, we're going to get that, too. We can see that this is contained inside version 2, and we can take the other two versions and do the same thing. The stories are in version 2, and they're also part of this epic:</p>
<div><img src="img/00053.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Backlog view</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, we want to take a look at Quick filters. These can be really powerful, especially if we're working together as a group with our team, and we've got to be looking at this backlog and moving quickly through. JIRA gives us some default quick filters. They only give us issues and items that have recently been updated. They also give us Assignee, which is also helpful, but let's say we want to take a look at anything that would be part of the component that we assigned earlier:</p>
<div><img src="img/00054.jpeg" class="calibre54"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We had this component that was a grouping of items that we put together, which was called My Test Component. Why don't we go back to our Backlog? We're going to go to the top corner of the screen and select Board settings. We'll take a look at a lot of these board settings later in the next section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We're going to go under Quick Filters and call this <kbd class="calibre12">Test Component</kbd>. In our query for this, our JQL is going to be <kbd class="calibre12">component= "My Test Component"</kbd>. We can also put a description if we want to. Next, we'll hit the Add button, and we'll have created a quick filter called <kbd class="calibre12">Test Component</kbd>:</p>
<div><img src="img/00055.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">If we come back to the Backlog again, we can see that we have a Test Component query. If we select this, only the items that have components assigned to them should appear. We assigned that component as My Test Component earlier to the newest story when we were in the Edit window for that story:</p>
<div><img src="img/00056.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">The next thing we want to take a look at is the creation of a ready Sprint. Click on Clear all filters so that we can see all of our items. We can see the Create sprint button, where we can create a Sprint. We're not going to run it, but we can create a Sprint, and we can basically use that as a container to help us when we have work in our backlog that's ready to go. We call that refined. We've got work here that's refined, which means that it meets our definition of ready for the team that's coming into a Sprint. This means that will have acceptance criteria, it will be sized with some sort of a value, and it will have all the information required for us to to fix or build something:</p>
<div><img src="img/00057.jpeg" class="calibre55"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can take the three newest items, as shown in the following screenshot, and we can drag them straight up and place them into a Sprint. We can call this Sprint <kbd class="calibre12">Ready</kbd>:</p>
<div><img src="img/00058.jpeg" class="calibre56"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Then, what we can do is we can use that fully refined work, not only in our next Sprint, but as the team increases in velocity, to actually pull stories from this section into our Sprint so that the team has work as they accelerate. We'll look more at that as we get into running a Sprint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the next section, we're going to talk about treating and configuring the board. We've got our backlog ready to go, we've got issues that have been created, and they've been assigned to epics and versions. We know what all the attributes are underneath those things.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, we're going to take a look at the board, which is what we're going to use when we're running a Sprint, which means that we're preparing to run our first Sprint.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating and configuring our board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section we're going to talk about creating and configuring our board.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this section we're going to talk about the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="mce-root1">Differences between a virtual scrum board and an actual scrum board</li>
<li class="mce-root1">The columns that represent workflow states and how to modify a workflow</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Swimlanes </li>
<li class="mce-root1">Estimation options–time versus story points</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Let's go ahead and go over to JIRA. We can see what we've done here is we've actually taken our items that were not in our Ready Sprint. They have not been refined, and we have taken them and pulled them into a Sprint 0, which is a test Sprint. This will eventually be the Sprint that we'll put on our Sprint board, but in the meantime, we have to get our board ready. We can see that what we've done here is we've actually assigned story point values to each of these stories. We will be able to see them in the screenshot in gray, and we can also see them in the preview pane as well:</p>
<div><img src="img/00059.jpeg" class="calibre57"/></div>
<p>Backlog view</p>
<p class="calibre2">The following screenshot represents our Active sprints, and this is eventually going to be our board. If we hit Start sprint, these items will appear on this active Sprint board, but let's just take a look at this board before we start a Sprint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A physical Scrum board would be a white board with columns on it. Each one of those columns would represent the different steps in our workflow:</p>
<div><img src="img/00060.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">And we can see, in its simplest form, we've got things that need to be done, we've got things that are in progress, and we've got things that have been completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our Quick filters are also available for us. We can see that we have the ability to take a look at this, and a lot of times what we want to do is actually set up all of the different team members that are going to be working on stories in this Sprint and put them across the top. Then, as we're going through a daily Scrum, we can actually click on each name and look at just the items for that person and try and figure out if there are any impediments. This is the role of the Scrum master as we move through a Scrum Sprint.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, we need to add a testing step in the workflow so that things should be in TO DO, and then they'll be DONE, IN PROGRESS. Once they've been worked on, they need to be tested before they're considered done, and that way we can maintain a high level of quality. We have lots of testers in our Scrum team, and this is going to work out just fine because we can actually move a card into that testing column and we can have one of the testers help us with testing that. If we move into the upper right corner here, we will see three ellipses (…). Let's go into Board settings and take a look at this. We were in here previously, setting up a quick filter for our Test Component. Look under General settings for our board, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00061.jpeg" class="calibre58"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can see that we have things like our Board name, which we can change regarding whether it appears here, the Administrators, and the location. We can actually create queries and generate boards from our queries, but we're just using the JIRA default for this project. We can see that in the preceding screenshot, we have the project, we have the query, and we can see that we've actually got multiple projects that we can put into a board as well, but we're going to leave these settings as they are.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, we'll take a look at Columns:</p>
<div><img src="img/00062.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Settings for FP board</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is the thing that we wanted to modify. We want to add a testing step in my workflow. In order to add a new column, we'll need another status, all right? We've created this TESTING status in my workflow, as we can see in the preceding screenshot, and the way we add another status to this is by going to the Workflow. Remember the workflow from a previous section that we did? We can take a look at these workflows by selecting the edit icon:</p>
<div><img src="img/00063.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Issues</p>
<p class="calibre2">We can see here that what we've done is we've actually created a TESTING step. Any step can transition into this step. Basically, we've got this TESTING step, and we are allowing all statuses to transition to this one; we have this in my workflow. Let's go ahead and go back to our project. We're going to go back into Issues, go to Settings, go to Projects, and we're going go back to our First Project. We should be at the board for our First Project. We've created that step in the workflow. If we go back into our Board settings, in the columns, we can add a column and we can say that we want to call this column <kbd class="calibre12">Testing</kbd>. We can see that this column won't show on the board without a status, but that's okay because we created that status in the workflow. We can move that status into the column we just created:</p>
<div><img src="img/00064.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Column management</p>
<p class="calibre2">We have the To Do, In Progress, Testing, and Done columns. If we go back to the board, we'll see that we have a TESTING column.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, we can take a look at Swimlanes. </p>
<p class="calibre2">Swimlanes actually cut across a board, and we can use them in a variety of different ways. JIRA gives us some options to do that:</p>
<div><img src="img/00065.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Swimlanes</p>
<p class="calibre2">In most cases, what we might do is for Assignees, Epics, or Stories, if we've got stories with subtasks underneath them then our subtask will be what is shown on the board, and we can expand and collapse the stories in Swimlanes. We'll leave it at Stories for now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We've already talked about Quick filters. We've got some capabilities to modify Card colors based on the options shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00066.jpeg" class="calibre59"/></div>
<p>Card colors</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, if we've got a high-priority card, because the priority is set to high/critical, we can have it change color. We can also change the items that appear on our card, and we can show three additional fields. This allows us to pick what those three additional fields might be, but for now we'll leave them as their default settings:</p>
<div><img src="img/00067.jpeg" class="calibre60"/></div>
<p>Card layout</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, we've got Estimation. What we do with Scrum is we measure my velocity in story points. We don't really use time, as we found that relative estimation is much more effective than time estimation. However, lots of teams still use time to perform estimations:</p>
<div><img src="img/00068.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Estimation</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we do use time and we're burning down hours, this would be where we would want to make that change. We would want a Remaining Estimate and Time Spent, we'd select the item, and then we can perform our estimation on the original time estimate. Finally, Working Days, as we might imagine, is really about setting the working days for the group that's going to be using this board:</p>
<div><img src="img/00069.jpeg" class="calibre61"/></div>
<p>Time Zone</p>
<p class="calibre2">We've configured all of this, we've got our board ready to go, and we've got our Sprints with items in them. We think we're probably about ready to start a Sprint, and that's what's going to happen in the next chapter.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Let's talk about what we learned. We talked about what epics, stories, bugs, and tasks are, and how to use each of them, and why we use one versus the other. We learned about the different work item attributes that are available to us, free issue types, and then learned what they are and how to add or remove them so that we can configure JIRA to meet the needs of our team. Then, we learned how to manage the items that are in our backlog, prioritization, assigning the edit, assigning to epics and versions, and more. Finally, talked about what a board is, how to configure that board so that the workflow matches our workflow, and how to effectively manage those items as they go through a Sprint.</p>
<p class="calibre2"> In the next chapter, we're going to go ahead and start our project.</p>
