<p>We are finished with this book, but we only started with Kubernetes. It is so vast that no single book can cover even the core components. If we extend the scope to all the members of <strong>Cloud Native Computing Foundation</strong> (<strong>CNCF</strong>) (<a href="https://www.cncf.io/" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.cncf.io/</span></a>) project as well as third-party solutions that can be added, we'd need a series of books dedicated only to Kubernetes. To make things more complicated, the Kubernetes ecosystem is growing so fast that it is almost impossible to keep the pace. Even if we could somehow learn everything there is to know today, we would be left behind a week later.</p>
<p>There is an almost infinite number of combinations we can use to create and use a Kubernetes cluster. We can choose to stick only with core components, or we can combine them with third-party tools. We could choose to use only "vanilla Kubernetes", or we can adopt one of the platforms like OpenShift (<a href="https://www.openshift.com/" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.openshift.com/</span></a>), Docker Enterprise Edition (<a href="https://www.docker.com/kubernetes#/EE" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.docker.com/kubernetes#/EE</span></a>), or <a href="https://rancher.com/">Rancher</a> (<a href="https://rancher.com/" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">https://rancher.com/</span></a>). There are many others we might want to explore, and the list is growing with each passing day.</p>
<p>Some of the Kubernetes platforms are highly opinionated while others force us to choose ourselves the components that'll constitute a cluster. We can easily spend eternity evaluating which components are the best for our use case. Take networking as an example. There are at least twenty solutions I know of, and I'm pretty sure that number can be multiplied by ten. You can easily get blocked only with that single choice. Add persistent storage, Ingress, and authentication to the mix and the amount of the things we need to evaluate is already beyond the capacity of a single person.</p>
<p>If we add hosting providers to the evaluation, we are faced with additional options and new constraints. Almost all realized by now that Kubernetes is going to be the norm and that it is paramount to adopt it to their offerings. They are all adding their own components to make Kubernetes work seamlessly on their infrastructure. They are trying to attract you by saying that Kubernetes works better there than anywhere else. That also means that you will face additional new components.</p>
<p>Kubernetes is designed to be extensible. Almost every software and hosting vendor is adding their own components to the mix. That extensibility is probably the main reason why Kubernetes got such a broad adoption, why it grew so big, but also why it is so complex and, at times, not very intuitive. It is enormous, and it will continue growing. With that growth comes complexity that can be overwhelming.</p>
<p>There is no reason to despair. The principles you learned are valid no matter how you set up your Kubernetes cluster or which parts of the ecosystem you choose to use. If you did not just skim through the book, you should know the essential core components. You did the hardest part. You learned some of the most commonly used resources. You know the logic behind them, and you know how to connect them. From now on, you just need to continue exploring and extending your Kubernetes knowledge. That is, if you make Kubernetes your platform of choice.</p>
<p>For many, what you learned so far is (almost) everything they'll need. If that's not the case, the work on <em>The DevOps 2.4 Toolkit</em> already started and I hope you'll join me for the rest of the journey.</p>
<p>I do not yet know the scope of the next book. What I do know is that there are too many Kubernetes-related subjects I had to leave out of this book to keep it within four hundred pages of self-imposed limit. The good news is that the next book is also going to be related to Kubernetes. Maybe it will be called "<em>Things you Failed to Find in the DevOps 2.3 Toolkit</em>" or maybe it will be "<em>The DevOps 2.4 Toolkit –  Advanced Kubernetes</em>". It'll become clear soon. Maybe, by the time you're reading this text, it is already published.</p>

<p>I published the book on LeanPub (<a href="https://leanpub.com/the-devops-2-3-toolkit" target="_blank"><span class="URLPACKT">https://leanpub.com/the-devops-2-3-toolkit</span></a>) early. Around 10% was written when it went public. That allowed many of you to get early access to the material, and it gave me an opportunity to get your feedback. The result is fantastic. Many sent me their notes, reported bugs, proposed suggestions for improvements, recommended tools and processes that should be explored, and so on.</p>
<p>It would be tempting to take the whole credit for the book, but that would be untrue. This book is the result of teamwork between the author (me) and many of the readers (you). It proves that lean publishing works and that we can apply agile principles when writing a book. There was no fixed scope and decisions were not made in advance. I would work on a chapter and deliver it when it's finished (<em>sprint</em>). You would review it and send your notes and comments that would allow me to improve it (<em>sprint review</em>). We had a daily exchange of emails and Slack messages (<em>daily standups</em>). We did short iterations that allowed us to learn from the mistakes and improve.</p>
<p>Dear readers, <strong>you made this book great!</strong></p>
<p>A few stick from the crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Neeraj Kothari</strong> helped by questioning my writing, providing suggestions, and sending me comments. He thought that my sequences and diagrams were too basic, not to say incorrect. He was so persistent that I delegated them to him. Most of the diagrams you saw in the book are his as well as the explanations of the events that transpire when we execute <kbd><span class="VerbatimChar">kubectl</span></kbd> commands.</p>
<p>I'd love to put his biography, but he seems to ignore my requests to write down who he is and what he does. He probably will. Time will tell.</p>
<p><strong>Prageeth Warnak</strong> was continually sending pull requests with corrections and suggestions. He made this book much clearer than it would be if I had to rely on my, often incorrect, assumptions of what readers expect.</p>
<p>Prageeth is a seasoned IT professional currently working as the lead software architect for Australian <em>telco giant Telstra</em>. He enjoys working with new technologies, and he likes spending his leisure time reading books (especially those written by Viktor), watching Netflix and Fox news. He lives in Melbourne with his family. He is fascinated getting Microservices and DevOps done right.</p>
<p><strong>David Jacob</strong> did his best to correct my "broken" English. Without him, you'd have a hard time understanding what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>David is a backend Java developer who has transformed into a system administrator over the past two years. He is focusing on becoming more proficient in Linux, networking and DevOps practices and will hopefully have more time for programming again one day. He lives in Berlin and has no cats.</p>
<p><strong>Don Becker</strong> helped with Windows and troubleshooting Minikube using Hyper-V.</p>
<p>Don is tech industry veteran having held numerous positions in nearly every facet of IT and software development. He resides in Phoenix, Arizona with his wife, three kids and three cats. His current focus is the shift from virtual machines to containerization, microservices, OpenFAAS and of course, Kubernetes.</p>
<p><strong>Vadim Gusev</strong> helped to proofread and discuss book structure from the novice point of view.</p>
<p>Vadim is young IT specialist that started his career as a network engineer but was so fascinated by the idea of clouds and containers, that he decided to switch his career path to DevOps. He works in a small startup and leads it to bright containerized future, guided mostly by Viktor's books. In his free time he likes to work out, play drums and procrastinate on purpose.</p>
