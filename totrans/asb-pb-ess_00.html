DevOps tools and practices have become a necessity to automate every stage of such a scalable, dynamic, and complex infrastructure. Configuration management tools are at the core of this devops tool set.</p><p>Ansible is a simple, efficient, fast configuration management, orchestration and application deployment tool all combined into one. This book helps you to get familiar  with writing Playbooks, Ansible's automation language. This book follows a hands-on approach to show you how to create flexible, dynamic, reusable, and data-driven roles. It then takes you through the advanced features of Ansible, such as node discovery, clustering, securing data with vault, and managing environments, and finally shows you how to use Ansible to orchestrate multitier infrastructure stack.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
