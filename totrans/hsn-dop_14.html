<ul>
<li><strong>Functional testing</strong>: Verifying the functionality of the application based on business rules and requirements.</li>
<li><strong>API testing</strong>: Verifying the JSON request and response using Postman for various services. Using Postman, creating and automating test cases.</li>
<li><strong>SLA testing</strong>: Verifying the request and response times of different services/ pages and comparing them with SLA's metrics provided by the development team.</li>
<li><strong>UI testing</strong>: Comparing the UI elements / graphics based on the Wire Frames or Creatives provided by the design team.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility testing</strong>:
<ul>
<li><strong>OS compatibility testing</strong>: Verifying the application in different OS platforms, such as Windows, Mac, and Linux, and with different Mobile OS (iOS, Android, BlackBerry, Windows, Symbian, and so on).</li>
<li><strong>Browser compatibility testing</strong>: Verifying the application in different Browser platforms, such as Firefox, Chrome, IE, Safari (iOS), and Chrome (Android).</li>
<li><strong>Hardware compatibility testing:</strong> Verifying the application in different hardware requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>DB testing</strong>: Verifying the data is modified/created or deleted based on the operations performed on the UI side (frontend).</li>
<li><strong>Migration testing</strong>: Verifying the user's data is migrated properly after rewriting the site from v1.0 to v2.0.</li>
<li><strong>Integration testing</strong>: Verifying the API services after testing and integrating with all services.</li>
<li><strong>Performance testing</strong>: Verifying the application performance on various work loads and also testing memory leaks using Jmeter.</li>
<li><strong>Security testing</strong>: Verifying the application's vulnerabilities using VERA Code.</li>
<li><strong>User experience testing:</strong> Verifying the application accessibility and user friendliness.</li>
<li><strong>Localization testing</strong>: Verifying the content of the application in different languages (for example, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, and so on).</li>
<li><strong>Smoke/Sanity testing</strong>: Verifying the application basic functionalities before performing any major tests on the new builds.</li>
<li><strong>Regression testing</strong>:Â Verifying affected areas when there is any bug fix or new feature/functionality implemented.</li>
<li><strong>Ad hoc testing</strong>: Verifying the application functionality randomly without knowing about the application behavior.</li>
<li><strong>Exploratory testing</strong>: Verifying the application functionality randomly by knowing the application behavior.</li>
</ul>
