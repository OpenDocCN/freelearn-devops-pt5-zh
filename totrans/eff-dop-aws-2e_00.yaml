- en: The DevOps movement has transformed the way modern tech companies work. Amazon
    Web Services (AWS), which has been at the forefront of the cloud computing revolution,
    has also been a key contributor to the DevOps movement, creating a huge range
    of managed services that help you implement DevOps principles.

- en: In this book, you'll understand how the most successful tech start-ups launch
    and scale their services on AWS, and learn how you can do the same, too. This
    book explains how to treat infrastructure as code, meaning you can bring resources
    online and offline as easily as you control your software. You will also build
    a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline to keep your app up
    to date.

- en: Once you have got to grips will all this, you'll move on to learning how to
    scale your applications to offer maximum performance to users even when traffic
    spikes, by using the latest technologies such as containers. In addition to this,
    you'll get insights into monitoring and alerting, so you can make sure your users
    have the best experience when using your service. In the concluding chapters,
    you'll cover inbuilt AWS tools such as CodeDeploy and CloudFormation, which are
    used by many AWS administrators to perform DevOps.

    Web Application*, this chapter will demonstrate AWS infrastructure provisioning
    in simplest form with some of the best AWS authentication practices. We will create
    a simple web application and understand how to host the application on AWS in
    the easiest form and finally will terminate the instance. This whole process will
    be implemented using AWS cli utility and will be automated in further chapter
    to understand how manual tasks can be automated using different available AWS
    and other famous services and products.'
