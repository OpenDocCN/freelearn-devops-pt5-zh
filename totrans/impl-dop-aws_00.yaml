- en: DevOps is gradually becoming the *de facto* methodology or framework and is adopted
    by organizations of all sizes. It has enabled technology teams to work more efficiently
    and made their work more rewarding by tightening the feedback loop between the
    developer and the end user. Team members enjoy a more pleasant, more productive
    work environment through much increased collaboration.

    the industry charts with its 31% market share. Starting back in 2006, *Amazon
    Web Services* has evolved into a large, independent, sophisticated ecosystem in
    the *Cloud.* It is and has been launching new services at an astonishing rate.
    The *AWS* product categories range from raw compute and database resources to
    storage, analytics, *AI,* game development, and mobile services to *IoT* solutions*.*'

    to follow, we will see how the convenience and elasticity of *AWS* greatly complements
