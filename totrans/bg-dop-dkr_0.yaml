- en: DevOps with Docker outlines the power of containerization and the influence
    this innovation has on development teams and general operations. We also get to
    understand what DevOps really is, the principles involved, and how the process
    contributes to product health, by implementing a Docker workflow. Docker is an
    open source containerization tool that makes it easier to streamline product delivery
    and reduce the time it takes to get from a whiteboard sketch of the business to
    a money-back implementation.
