- en: We are finished with this book, but we only started with Kubernetes. It is so
    vast that no single book can cover even the core components. If we extend the
    scope to all the members of **Cloud Native Computing Foundation** (**CNCF**) ([https://www.cncf.io/](https://www.cncf.io/))
    project as well as third-party solutions that can be added, we'd need a series
    of books dedicated only to Kubernetes. To make things more complicated, the Kubernetes
    ecosystem is growing so fast that it is almost impossible to keep the pace. Even
    if we could somehow learn everything there is to know today, we would be left
    behind a week later.

- en: There is an almost infinite number of combinations we can use to create and
    use a Kubernetes cluster. We can choose to stick only with core components, or
    we can combine them with third-party tools. We could choose to use only "vanilla
    Kubernetes", or we can adopt one of the platforms like OpenShift ([https://www.openshift.com/](https://www.openshift.com/)),
    Docker Enterprise Edition ([https://www.docker.com/kubernetes#/EE](https://www.docker.com/kubernetes#/EE)),
    or [Rancher](https://rancher.com/) ([https://rancher.com/](https://rancher.com/)).
    There are many others we might want to explore, and the list is growing with each
    passing day.

- en: Some of the Kubernetes platforms are highly opinionated while others force us
    to choose ourselves the components that'll constitute a cluster. We can easily
    spend eternity evaluating which components are the best for our use case. Take
    networking as an example. There are at least twenty solutions I know of, and I'm
    pretty sure that number can be multiplied by ten. You can easily get blocked only
    with that single choice. Add persistent storage, Ingress, and authentication to
    the mix and the amount of the things we need to evaluate is already beyond the
    capacity of a single person.

- en: If we add hosting providers to the evaluation, we are faced with additional
    options and new constraints. Almost all realized by now that Kubernetes is going
    to be the norm and that it is paramount to adopt it to their offerings. They are
    all adding their own components to make Kubernetes work seamlessly on their infrastructure.
    They are trying to attract you by saying that Kubernetes works better there than
    anywhere else. That also means that you will face additional new components.

- en: Kubernetes is designed to be extensible. Almost every software and hosting vendor
    is adding their own components to the mix. That extensibility is probably the
    main reason why Kubernetes got such a broad adoption, why it grew so big, but
    also why it is so complex and, at times, not very intuitive. It is enormous, and
    it will continue growing. With that growth comes complexity that can be overwhelming.

- en: There is no reason to despair. The principles you learned are valid no matter
    how you set up your Kubernetes cluster or which parts of the ecosystem you choose
    to use. If you did not just skim through the book, you should know the essential
    core components. You did the hardest part. You learned some of the most commonly
    used resources. You know the logic behind them, and you know how to connect them.
    From now on, you just need to continue exploring and extending your Kubernetes
    knowledge. That is, if you make Kubernetes your platform of choice.

    not the case, the work on *The DevOps 2.4 Toolkit* already started and I hope
    you'll join me for the rest of the journey.

- en: I do not yet know the scope of the next book. What I do know is that there are
    too many Kubernetes-related subjects I had to leave out of this book to keep it
    within four hundred pages of self-imposed limit. The good news is that the next
    book is also going to be related to Kubernetes. Maybe it will be called "*Things
    you Failed to Find in the DevOps 2.3 Toolkit*" or maybe it will be "*The DevOps
    2.4 Toolkit –  Advanced Kubernetes*". It'll become clear soon. Maybe, by the time
    you're reading this text, it is already published.

    early. Around 10% was written when it went public. That allowed many of you to
    get early access to the material, and it gave me an opportunity to get your feedback.
    The result is fantastic. Many sent me their notes, reported bugs, proposed suggestions
    for improvements, recommended tools and processes that should be explored, and
    so on.

    untrue. This book is the result of teamwork between the author (me) and many of
    the readers (you). It proves that lean publishing works and that we can apply
    agile principles when writing a book. There was no fixed scope and decisions were
    not made in advance. I would work on a chapter and deliver it when it's finished
    (*sprint*). You would review it and send your notes and comments that would allow
    me to improve it (*sprint review*). We had a daily exchange of emails and Slack
    messages (*daily standups*). We did short iterations that allowed us to learn
    from the mistakes and improve.

    events that transpire when we execute `kubectl` commands.'
