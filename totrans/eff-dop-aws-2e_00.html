<p class="mce-root"><span>The DevOps movement has transformed the way modern tech companies work. Amazon Web Services (AWS), which has been at the forefront of the cloud computing revolution, has also been a key contributor to the DevOps movement, creating a huge range of managed services that help you implement DevOps principles.</span></p>
<p class="mce-root"><span>In this book, you'll understand how the most successful tech start-ups launch and scale their services on AWS, and learn how you can do the same, too. This book explains how to treat infrastructure as code, meaning you can bring resources online and offline as easily as you control your software. You will also build a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline to keep your app up to date.</span><br/>
<span>Once you have got to grips will all this, you'll move on to learning how to scale your applications to offer maximum performance to users even when traffic spikes, by using the latest technologies such as containers. In addition to this, you'll get insights into monitoring and alerting, so you can make sure your users have the best experience when using your service. In the concluding chapters, you'll cover inbuilt AWS tools such as CodeDeploy and CloudFormation, which are used by many AWS administrators to perform DevOps.</span><br/>
<span>By the end of this book, you'll have learned how to ensure the security of your platform and data using the latest and most prominent AWS tools.</span></p>

<p><a href="1abe175d-50df-434d-bc0a-097397a39cee.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Deploying Your First Web Application</em><span>, this chapter will demonstrate AWS infrastructure provisioning in simplest form with some of the best AWS authentication practices. We will create a simple web application and understand how to host the application on AWS in the easiest form and finally will terminate the instance. This whole process will be implemented using AWS cli utility and will be automated in further chapter to understand how manual tasks can be automated using different available AWS and other famous services and products.</span></p>
<p><a href="8a74da7b-0748-4b90-a3bc-58e853e820ec.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Treating Your Infrastructure as Code</em><span>, this chapter will focus on Automating Provisioning using AWS native utility CloudFormation and the techniques used to create CloudFormation templates. Then we will introduce a Configuration Management system to automate application deployments with Ansible.</span></p>
<p><a href="1528f579-c596-4cda-8f8c-09f2c7772c5e.xhtml">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Infrastructure as Code with Terraform</em>, this chapter will focus on understanding the fundamentals of Terraform. We will provision our first AWS instance using Terraform templates and then extend the power of Terraform to deploy the application using another Terraform Template. Finally we will understand AWS provisioning using Terraform by integrate it with Ansible automation for application deployments.</p>
<p><a href="93bb1465-ceda-4cb9-823e-5a4355720a79.xhtml">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Adding Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment</em><span>, this chapter will focus on building CI/CD pipelines using AWS DevOps services with Automated Testing Framework. We will prepare a technology framework using multiple tools like Version Control, Continuous Integration, Automated Testing tools, AWS native DevOps tools and Infrastructure Automation tools to understand how fail fast and fail often lead to an robust production environment.</span></p>
<p><a href="c54f64c9-e8a3-4eed-b68d-087ff40f8b1d.xhtml">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Scaling Your Infrastructure</em><span>, this chapter will introduce other useful cost effective AWS services to build scalable AWS infrastructure with performance oriented vision. AWS services like Elastic Cache, CloudFront, SQS, Kinesis and so on will be used to build our application Framework.</span></p>
<p><a href="ecc92f8f-a066-4b63-bc49-98461dd5c54a.xhtml">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Running Containers in AWS</em><span>,  t</span><span>his chapter will introduce one of the most niche technologies in the market Docker. We will get started with the understanding of container using Docker with all of the essential concepts. Here we will build AWS container environment with ECS and build a complete framework of ECS for our application. At last we will build a complete CI/CD pipeline to deploy AWS ECS services using AWS DevOps tool set.</span></p>
<p><a href="0eb2bba9-5a84-4031-93d2-72dc4d6d4dd3.xhtml">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Hardening the Security of Your AWS Environment</em><span>, this chapter will focus on identifying and securing your AWS environment using AWS auditing services, AWS IAM services for managing and providing limited access as per roles, strengthening AWS VPC model and finally protecting against ransomware and other vulnerabilities.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="">Chapter 9</a>, </span><em>Monitoring and Alerting</em><span>, this chapter will focus on building a monitoring framework for your AWS environment using AWS CloudWatch service. We will use some of the famous dashboard tools for visualization of logs. Finally a notification framework will be created using AWS SNS services to notify the users about the health of your AWS environment to take corrective actions.

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Click on t</span>he start <span>button and search for </span><kbd>settings</kbd> option."</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>var http = require("http") http.createServer(function (request, response) {<br/>// Send the HTTP header<br/>// HTTP Status: 200 : OK<br/>// Content Type: text/plain<br/>response.writeHead(200, {'Content-Type': 'text/plain'})<br/>// Send the response body as "Hello World" response.end('Hello World\n')<br/>}).listen(3000)<br/><br/>// Console will print the message console.log('Server running')</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre><strong>$ aws ec2 describe-instance-status --instance-ids i-057e8deb1a4c3f35d --output text| grep -i SystemStatus</strong><br/><strong><br/></strong>SYSTEMSTATUS ok</pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>$ aws ec2 authorize-security-group-ingress \</strong>
   <strong>--group-name HelloWorld \</strong>
   <strong>--protocol tcp \</strong>
   <strong>--port 3000 \</strong>
   <strong>--cidr 0.0.0.0/0</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "In this menu, find the feature called <span class="packt_screen">Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta).</span></span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
