<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we'll understand how Jira Software works. We'll first learn how to enable Jira Software in our Jira Cloud instance, then we'll quickly create a new Jira Software project. We'll spend some time going through an overview of Agile concepts before looking at the Scrum and Kanban methodologies and discussing the key differences between them. Finally, we'll discuss important Jira Software reports to analyze your progress in the project.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Jira Software for development teams</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira Software is one of the most popular applications used by development teams to plan and track their projects. In the previous chapter, we discussed various aspects of Jira Core, which provides good issue tracking capabilities for business teams. Jira Software, when enabled in our instance, will provide additional features on top of what we've already seen with Jira Core.</p>
<p>Let's now understand how to work on Jira Software by looking at its features.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Enabling Jira Software</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira Software, as a separate application, needs to be purchased or evaluated using a trial license and enabled in our instance.</p>
<p>In the rest of this book, we're going to refer to the Site administration section a lot to make configuration changes. You can access the Site administration section in the bottom-left corner of your instance, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>That's it! Your Jira Software trial is now enabled. Feel free to use it for 30 days; after that, you can always sign up for a new Jira Cloud instance or you can purchase it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Overview of Agile concepts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We now have Jira Software enabled in our instance. It's time to create a new project and get started; however, Jira Software enables your team to work using Agile-based methodologies and supports both Scrum and Kanban; hence, before we dive straight into the features of Jira Software, it makes sense to do a very quick walk-through of various Agile concepts.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What is Agile?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Agile is just a set of values and principles for development. It's a time-boxed, iterative approach to developing software incrementally instead of delivering it all in one go, hence making it easier to deliver it fast and efficiently. Agile practices are adopted by organizations mainly because the market these days is ever evolving and the scope of the project changes during the later stages of development. The model selected for  development should also incorporate changes in projects and still deliver quickly.</p>
<p>You can read about the 12 Agile principles by checking out the following link:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/">https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto/</a></p>
<p>One of the key objectives of Agile practices that needs to be supported by the tool is continuous improvement and continuous delivery, which are part of DevOp, a well-known buzz word these days. Jira Software can not only support Agile-based methodologies but can also provide integration with other development tools.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Scrum and Kanban methodologies</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira Software supports both Scrum and Kanban methodologies, which are two of the most common and popular Agile-based practices. Let's understand what these are the fundamental difference between them.</p>
<p><strong>Scrum</strong> is a process framework for structuring your project where work is planned first and then executed in iterations also known as Sprints. Commitment is the change agent in Scrum—that is, how much work a team can deliver is the commitment. The main idea is to deliver small usable chunks fast. After every iteration (Sprint), a working usable piece of software is expected and, as new chunks are delivered in future Sprints, they're also plugged into the existing piece of software, hence making the whole software modular. Communication within the team is key to making Scrum work for you. Scrum is more suitable for projects where planning and estimation is required, which is mostly in software projects.</p>
<p><strong>Kanban</strong> focuses on incremental improvements where <strong>Work in Progress</strong> (<strong>WIP</strong>). Limit is the change agent—that is, how much work a team is currently doing is an important criteria on. As compared to Scrum, there isn't much focus on planning. A typical example of the Kanban methodology is the support desk, where work is done as it comes and, based on the number of people in the team, the amount of work a team can do needs to be visualized and improved.</p>
<p>We'll create projects in our Jira instance using both Scrum and Kanban to understand these fundamental differences better.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Key Agile concepts</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In a moment, we'll dive into our tool again to work on an Agile-based project, but it's very important to understand some key Agile concepts or terminologies used. Some of them are explained in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scrum artifacts</strong>: These include the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Product backlog</strong>: This is a list of tasks or issues pending in the project</li>
<li><strong>Sprint backlog</strong>: A list of tasks selected for development in a specific Sprint</li>
<li><strong>Burndown</strong>: This is a report that shows the progress of a Sprint</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The types of task are as follows:
<ul>
<li><strong>Epic</strong>: This is a very high-level task that can be broken down into further tasks. Epics are similar to stories but used for better organization in the project.</li>
<li><strong>Story</strong>: Again, this is a high-level task that can be broken down into further tasks. Individual stories are estimated.</li>
<li><strong>Sub-tasks</strong>: These are the broken-down tasks of a specific story.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Prioritization</strong>: This is based on rank, which is the order in which the tasks need to be completed either in a Sprint backlog or Sprint.</li>
<li><strong>Estimation</strong>: This is based on story points, a unit of measure for expressing the overall effort to fully implement a story. In Jira, a story point is a numeric field.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration</strong>: This is referred to as a Sprint. This is the actual iteration containing the list of planned estimated stories that need to be delivered within a specific period of time. Each story in a Sprint is assigned to a specific user or developer.</li>
<li><strong>Visualization</strong>: The following are used:
<ul>
<li><strong>Board</strong>: A place where the status of a specific Sprint, such as how many Stories are pending, in progress, and done, can be viewed by everyone in the team.</li>
<li>Columns: A typical board has three columns—TO DO, IN PROGRESS, and DONE—showing issues based on their status, but more columns can be added if required.</li>
<li><strong>Swimlanes</strong>: This is a horizontal grouping that can be created on a board to assist users when the number of stories is too many. For example, the issues on a board can be group based on the developer working on them or based on their priority.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Reports</strong>: These include the following:
<ul>
<li><strong>Burndown</strong>: One of the most popular and useful reports used to track the progress of a Sprint; on a graph, original story points are depicted versus actual story points that users are burning or completing, where the associated stories are implemented. </li>
<li><strong>Velocity charts</strong>: Velocity is the average number of story points a team is delivering over a period of time. It's important to know velocity as it will help the Scrum master or project manager to plan the next Sprint more efficiently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Roles in Agile</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Now that we know various key Agile concepts, let's also go through different types of role or people involved in a typical Agile-based project, as shown in the following. We mainly need to understand what these people will be doing in our project:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Scrum product owner (stakeholders or business analysts)</strong>: They define the product backlog we discussed in the previous section and write the stories need to be implemented for a successful project.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Scrum master (project manager or project lead)</strong>: They'll organize Scrum meetings, define rank, estimate story points, assign work to developers, and start Sprints.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Scrum team (developers or testers)</strong>: As the name suggests, these are the actual developers who will be either implementing the stories or testing them before the release.</li>
</ul>
<p>There're certainly more roles but these three are the bare minimum you should be aware of, especially when working on a Jira project. We're now fully equipped to dive into a Jira Software project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Is Jira suitable for development projects?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You must be wondering whether Jira Software is sufficient for your development project needs and we need to discuss some points to understand why Jira is probably the best choice for project management.</p>
<p class="mce-root">The advantages of Jira Software are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Jira supports standard development methodologies</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">It can be used out-of-the-box</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Apart from out of box templates, custom workflows can be created to support the processes</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Different roles such as developments and testers can be defined</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">It supports integration with development tools such as Bitbucket, GitHub, Bamboo, and Jenkins</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Jira perfectly supports DevOps practices</li>
</ul>
<p>Apart from using just Jira, which is a great issue-tracking tool, in <a href="40cf5a29-0d75-4c6c-a7ae-5d0c07c2d024.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introducing Jira</em>, we discussed the concept of the Marketplace app to extend the features of Jira Software.</p>
<p>Some examples of popular apps for extending Jira features for timesheets, testing, and advanced reporting are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Tempo Timesheet: Provide timesheet capabilities in your project</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Zephyr and X-ray: Use Jira for test management</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">EazyBI: Create customized reports for your projects</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">BigPicture: Create Gantt charts to plan for projects</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400">Portfolio: Agile road mapping and scenarios</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope you are now eager to start using Jira straight away. So let's do that now. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Scrum board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira Software lets you implement the Scrum technique in your project with the help of Scrum boards. To understand the features of these tools, we'll create a project using out-of-the box templates and some sample data.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a sample Scrum project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Scrum boards can be created from any existing Jira project that contains predefined issues. It's possible to create a Scrum board from a new blank project as well. Also, if you want to understand how Jira Software works, it's possible to create a sample project prepopulated with sample data.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Press the <em>/</em> (forward slash); it'll bring up the Search interface on the left-hand side. Type in <kbd>boards</kbd> and click on View all boards (under BOARDS), as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<p class="mce-root">We've just created a project with sample data along with a Scrum board. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Populating, ranking, and estimating a backlog using story points</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the newly created project, we have a Scrum board, which is displayed by default. You'll now see a list of issues that're pending and issues that aren't resolved yet in the Backlog section, and a sample Sprint, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/b4336ce2-56a9-4701-a3f0-650578fc449a.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 8</p>
<p>Backlog contains issues that're pending in the project or board. These issues are yet to be planned for execution. In the project sidebar, the first tab is Backlog followed by Active sprints. As soon as the sprint is started, you manage and work on it using the Active sprints tab.</p>
<p>The sample Scrum board already contains a Sprint that has certain issues in a specific order. A sprint is a time period during which specific planned activities need to be finished. The Scrum master or the project manager can define the order in which issues need to be completed. This order is also known as rank, and the team that's working on these issues needs to follow this order. Rank is important because there're certain tasks that need to be completed before other tasks can be started.</p>
<p>In a Scrum methodology, the estimation of individual tasks isn't only done on the basis of the amount of time spent, but also on the complexity of the tasks. For instance, there're two tasks with a time estimate of one day, but the first task is complex to execute because it was the first time that it was executed by the team or for some other reason. The complexity is measured by story points. The story point can be any number between 1 to 10 or any number in the Fibonacci sequence, that is, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, and 21. The higher the number, the more complex the task.</p>
<p>The scrum master can assign story points to issues in the Sprint; although it's not mandatory to have story points with each issue in the sprint, having them will give the team an idea about the complexity of the issue.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Planning and creating sprints  </h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The sample Scrum board already contains one running sprint; let's create a new sprint. Jira Software allows you to create another sprint even if the active sprint isn't completed, but the new sprint can't be started. However, it's possible to enable the parallel sprints feature in Jira Software that lets us run multiple sprints together.</p>
<p>The planning of the sprint has to be done in the Plan mode of the Scrum board. Perform the following steps to run multiple sprints together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Jira (under APPS) | Jira Settings | Applications | Jira Software configuration (under JIRA SOFTWARE), as shown here:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="2">
<li>Tick the checkbox for Parallel Sprints. That's it: now just go back to your board and start planning your next sprint.</li>
<li>Go back to the project and, in the Backlog tab, click on the Create sprint button just before the issue backlog, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<p>Note that you should never start the sprint until you've planned your issues well, ordered them, and estimated the story points. The moment you start the sprint, you'll be taken to the Active sprints tab in the Scrum board. Here, you'll see a list of all of the issues in your sprints across three columns, that is, TO DO, IN PROGRESS, and DONE, as shown here:</p>

<p>Active sprints is the section in the board that's monitored by team members once the sprint is running. When the number of people working on the sprint is too high, it may get difficult for them to find the issues they're working on. Let's take a look at some of the customizations done to the Scrum board. All of these options are available under the Board settings of a specific board, as shown here:</p>

<p>Figure 17</p>
<p>Click on the Board settings and then look at the configurations you can do in your board.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Swimlanes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The issues that appear in work mode can be grouped together so that it becomes easy for the respective member to find that issue on the board. Also, when issues are dragged from one column to another, they can only be dragged within their group, which is known as a swimlane. The default swimlane is the story issue type. The swimlane can also be based on epics and it's possible to have no swimlane at all.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Card colors</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The individual issues that appear in the Active sprints section are displayed in a rectangular block called a card. The color of these cards can be changed based on issue types, priorities, assignees, or queries.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Card layout</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The card in the Backlog and Active sprints sections displays the Issue Id and Issue Summary, but it's possible to add up to three additional fields. In total, you can add three additional fields that can appear on the card. This provision is provided so that fields that provide additional information can be made visible for the whole team to view.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Quick filters</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We saw how you can customize swimlanes to group several issues. Imagine a situation when there're 20 issues in Active sprints that're assigned to you in the currently active sprint, but there'll be certain issues that are the highest priority. In such cases, it'll be nice to not only quickly filter out issues assigned to you, but also to filter them based on priority, such as highest. This can be achieved by adding a custom query called a JQL in your quick filter. Later in this book, we'll understand how to create JQL queries. These customizations help the team to work efficiently so that they don't need to spend a lot of time finding the relevant information.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Jira Software reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You've learned how to plan, estimate, and start the sprint along with various configurations that we can do in the board. We checked how the team can view their tasks in the sprint. Now, it's time to monitor the progress of the team. There're two reports that're of prime importance. One is the Burndown Chart. This chart gives a clear picture of the current status of the sprint. The second is the Velocity Chart. This chart helps us understand the capacity of the team in terms of how much work it can handle. These two reports help the Scrum master monitor the progress of the project. Let's take a look at both these reports.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Burndown Chart</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>While planning the sprint, we primarily did two important things. Firstly, we prioritized the order in which the issues need to be completed. Secondly, we estimated the story points for issues. These story points, which we initially planned, give an idea of the complexity of the task. Now, the moment the sprint starts, a baseline is formed between the start date and the end date. This baseline is displayed with a gray line in the chart and it depicts the ideal scenario of executing the issues from the start date of the sprint until the end date. When the issue is resolved, its story points are burned and the total remaining story points of the whole sprint decreases.</p>
<p>On the project slidebar, navigate to Reports | Burndown Chart (under Agile) and select Sample Sprint 2, as shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/50a07e9b-5906-4017-88ff-be89bdf68406.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 18</p>
<p>When the team starts working on the issues, another line—this time red—starts following the baseline. Looking at this chart, the whole team can easily figure out whether they're on or off track. If the line for Remaining Values is progressing above the baseline guideline, then it shows that the story points are burned slowly. Eventually, all of the issues in the sprint won't be completed.</p>
<p>Just after the Burndown Chart, the details of the individual issues are displayed, where you can see how many issues there were at the beginning of the sprint. As the issues are resolved, their story points are deducted from the total story points of the sprint. The total story points and the remaining story points will be displayed to the user.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The Velocity Chart</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Every sprint has a total number of story points at the beginning. Ideally, the team working on the sprint should burn all of these points. In real-life cases, it's not always possible to complete all of the tasks by the end of the sprint. One of the main responsibilities of the Scrum master is to make sure that the team should have just enough story points to burn, not too many and not too few. However, at the beginning of the sprint, it's not that easy to estimate the amount of story points a team can burn. The Velocity Chart simply displays the number of story points planned versus those actually completed by the team. This comparison is shown for the past few sprints so that the average number of story points that the team can burn can be calculated. This is known as the capacity of the team.</p>
<p>Navigate Reports | Velocity Chart (under Agile) as shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ce6c5ab9-71f7-46f1-bb12-71c61fe14cf8.png" style="width:50.92em;height:50.75em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 19</p>
<p>This chart gives us a very clear indication of the story points that the team has been able to complete in the past sprints. If you take the average of all of the story points that your team has been able to burn till now, you'll get to know your capacity. It helps the Scrum master plan the next sprint with enough resources in the team.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Kanban board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Scrum technique is applicable in any process that requires planning, but there're various cases where the team is continuously working on activities as and when required. A typical example of this use case is customer support projects, where a certain number of people are assigned to handle the issues that're raised for a particular product or project by the company. Usually, these support issues require an  immediate response and detailed planning isn't required.</p>
<p>In such scenarios, the overall visualization of pending issues is important. A Kanban board doesn't have any plan mode like the Scrum board. It only has work mode, which is similar to a Scrum board.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up a Kanban board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A Kanban board can be created using existing projects or filters. To understand how the Kanban technique works in Jira, a sample board and project can be created just like the Scrum-based project that we created earlier. As you can notice from the following screenshot, the Active sprints tab isn't present in the Kanban board:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ef77bfef-acfb-4bce-bc73-1ffc881349af.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 20</p>
<p>The team sees the Kanban board only. This board is quite similar to the Scrum board; you can also configure the swimlanes based on assignees; by default, the swimlanes in the Kanban board are configured to use the priority = Highest query. This means that issues that should be resolved immediately are displayed at the top.</p>
<p>The people who have these issues assigned can move the issue from one column to another. These columns signify workflow states. Most of the configurations that we did for the Scrum board can be done on the Kanban board as well.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Column constraints</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When a team works on support issues, it's quite important to resolve the issues as soon as possible. Usually, companies sign SLAs—that is, Service Level Agreements—with their customers, where they need to agree on the resolution time. In situations like these, the whole team should get the overall picture of the issues that they need to work on. For instance, if there're fewer people available on support issues, then there's a limitation on the number of issues these people can work on at a given point in time. In the sample Kanban board, you can notice that the In progress column is red whenever there're more than one issue in it. You can change that by going to Board settings.</p>

<p>In this chapter, you learned how to implement Scrum and Kanban Agile methodologies using Jira Software. We first spent some time understanding Agile concepts and then we understood how to use both boards in Jira along with their configurations.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll discuss how to implement Jira Service Desk to take care of IT help desks and support desks. We'll see the various features and functionality of this application and how you can customize them to make it work for you as well.</p>
