- en: 'It seems that with each new book the scope gets fuzzier and less precise. When
    I started writing [Test-Driven Java Development](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YSIM3SC)
    the scope of the whole book was done in advance. I had a team working with me.
    We defined the index and a short description of each chapter. From there on we
    worked on a schedule as most technical authors do. Then I started writing the
    second book. The scope was more obscure. I wanted to write about DevOps practices
    and processes and had only a very broad idea what will be the outcome. I knew
    that Docker had to be there. I knew that configuration management is a must. Microservices,
    centralized logging, and a few other practices and tools that I used in my projects
    were part of the initial scope. For that book I had no one behind me. There was
    no team but me, a lot of pizzas, an unknown number of cans of Red Bull, and many
    sleepless nights. The result is [The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous
    Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M).
    With the third book, the initial scope became even more obscure. I started writing
    without a plan. It was supposed to be about cluster management. After a couple
    of months of work, I attended DockerCon in Seattle where we were presented with
    the new Docker Swarm Mode. My immediate reaction was to throw everything I wrote
    to trash and start over. I did not know what will the book be about except that
    it must be something about Docker Swarm. I was impressed with the new design.
    Something about Swarm ended up being [The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm: Building,
    testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914).
    While working on it, I decided to make **DevOps Toolkit Series**. I thought that
    it would be great to record my experiences from different experiments, and from
    working with various companies and open source projects. So, naturally, I started
    thinking and planning the third installment in the series; **The DevOps Toolkit
    2.2**. The only problem is that, this time, I truly don’t have a clue what will
    it be about. One idea was to do a deep comparison of different schedulers (e.g.
    Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Mesos/Maraton). The another was to explore serverless.
    Even though it is a terrible name (there are servers, we just don’t manage them),
    it is a great subject. The ideas kept coming but there was no clear winner. So,
    I decided not to define the scope. Instead, I defined some general objectives.'

  zh: 看起来每一本新书的范围都变得越来越模糊，不再那么精确。当我开始写作[《测试驱动的 Java 开发》](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00YSIM3SC)时，整本书的范围是提前就确定好的。我有一个团队与我合作。我们定义了目录和每一章的简短描述。从那时起，我们按照计划进行工作，就像大多数技术作者一样。然后我开始写第二本书。书的范围变得更加模糊。我想写的是
    DevOps 实践和流程，但我当时对最终结果只有一个非常宽泛的想法。我知道 Docker 必须包含在其中。我知道配置管理是必须的。微服务、集中日志记录，以及我在项目中使用的其他一些实践和工具，都是最初的范围之一。对于那本书，我没有任何人支持。没有团队，只有我、许多披萨、未知数量的红牛罐子和无数个不眠之夜。最终的成果是[《DevOps
    2.0 工具包：使用容器化微服务自动化持续部署管道》](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)。到了第三本书，最初的范围变得更加模糊。我开始写作时没有任何计划。最初的主题是集群管理。几个月后，我参加了在西雅图举行的
    DockerCon 大会，在会上展示了新的 Docker Swarm 模式。我当时的反应是：把我写的东西全部扔掉，重新开始。我不知道这本书到底会讲什么，只知道它必须和
    Docker Swarm 有关。我对新的设计印象深刻。关于 Swarm 的内容最终成为了[《DevOps 2.1 工具包：Docker Swarm：在 Docker
    Swarm 集群中构建、测试、部署和监控服务》](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914)。在写作过程中，我决定做一个**DevOps
    工具包系列**。我认为记录我从不同实验中获得的经验，或者与各种公司和开源项目合作的经历，应该会很有意思。所以，自然而然地，我开始思考并规划这个系列的第三本书；**DevOps
    工具包 2.2**。唯一的问题是，这次，我完全不知道这本书会讲什么。有一个想法是深入比较不同的调度器（例如 Docker Swarm、Kubernetes
    和 Mesos/Maraton）。另一个想法是探索无服务器架构。尽管这个名字很糟糕（其实有服务器，只是我们不去管理它们），但它是一个很好的主题。各种想法不断涌现，但没有一个明显的最终方向。所以，我决定不定义具体的范围，而是设定一些总体目标。
- en: The goals I set in front of me is to build a **self-adaptive** and **self-healing**
    system based on Docker. The only problem is that I do not yet know how I will
    do that. There are different bits of practices and tools I’ve been using, but
    there is no clearly visible light at the end of the tunnel. Instead of defining
    what the book will be, I defined what I want to accomplish. You can think of this
    book as my recording of the journey. I will need to explore a lot. I will probably
    need to adopt some new tools and write some code myself. I don’t know, yet. Maybe
    it will turn out to be something completely different, and there will not be a
    self-adaptive and self-healing system. We’ll see. Think of this book as “Viktor’s
    diary while trying to do stuff.”

  zh: 我设定的目标是构建一个基于 Docker 的**自适应**和**自愈**系统。唯一的问题是，我还不知道怎么做。我使用过不同的实践和工具，但隧道尽头并没有明确可见的光亮。与其定义这本书会是什么，我更定义了我想要实现的目标。你可以把这本书看作是我记录旅程的日志。我将需要探索很多，可能还需要采用一些新的工具，自己写些代码。我现在还不知道，也许它最终会变成完全不同的东西，根本不会有自适应和自愈系统。我们拭目以待。把这本书当作是“Viktor在尝试做事时的日记”。
- en: So, for now, the objectives are to go beyond a simple setup of a cluster, services,
    continuous deployment, and all the other things you probably already know. If
    you don’t, read my older books. I do not yet know the scope, nor I know what will
    be the result. Typically, when you write a book, you start with an outline and
    an index, write your chapters one by one and, at the end of the process, write
    a preface. It makes us (authors) look intelligent and in control. That is not
    the case. I did not write the preface at the end of the process (as an editor
    would advise me). I’m trying to be honest with you. I don’t have a plan.

  zh: 所以，目前的目标是超越简单的集群设置、服务、持续部署以及你可能已经知道的其他内容。如果你不知道，可以读读我的旧书。我目前还不知道具体的范围，也不知道结果会是什么。通常，当你写一本书时，你会从大纲和索引开始，一章一章地写，最后才写前言。这让我们（作者）看起来聪明而且掌控全局。但情况并非如此。我并没有在过程结束时写前言（正如编辑所建议的那样）。我想对你们保持诚实。我没有计划。
- en: You’ve been warned! I don’t know where this book is going nor whether I will
    manage to fulfill my self-defined objectives. I’ll do my best to outline the steps
    towards a self-adapting and self-healing system in the same way as I am exploring
    them myself.

  zh: 你们已经被警告了！我不知道这本书会走向何方，也不知道我是否能完成我自定的目标。我会尽力以我探索自适应和自愈系统的方式，概述前进的步骤。
