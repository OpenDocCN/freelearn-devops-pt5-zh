- en: 'This book will not teach you DevOps practices. It will not show you how Docker
    works. It will not explore how to build images, deploy services, operate Swarm
    clusters, nor how to do continuous deployment. We will not develop microservices
    nor will we go through practices and tools that allow us to create and manage
    our infrastructure. This book assumes that you already know all that. If you do
    not, please read [The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment
    Pipeline with Containerized Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)
    for a general overview of DevOps tools and practices and [The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit:
    Docker Swarm: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker
    Swarm clusters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914) for an in depth examination
    of how Docker Swarm clusters work.'

  zh: '本书不会教你DevOps实践。它不会展示Docker是如何工作的，也不会探讨如何构建镜像、部署服务、操作Swarm集群，或者如何进行持续部署。我们不会开发微服务，也不会讨论允许我们创建和管理基础设施的实践和工具。本书假设你已经了解这些内容。如果你不了解，请阅读[The
    DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized
    Microservices](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)以获取DevOps工具和实践的概述，并阅读[The
    DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring
    services inside Docker Swarm clusters](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914)以深入了解Docker
    Swarm集群的工作原理。'
- en: Now that you know what this book is NOT about, you are probably wondering what
    it is. Well… I don’t know yet. I decided to skip the planning and just start coding
    and writing about solutions that go beyond a simple cluster management and deployment
    of services. The objective is to create a self-adapting and self-healing system.
    That’s all I know for now. I’m not sure how I will do it nor whether I will succeed.
    What I do know is that I will write down every step of the journey.

  zh: 既然你知道本书不涉及哪些内容，你可能会想知道它到底讲了什么。嗯……我现在还不知道。我决定跳过规划，直接开始编写代码和写下超越简单集群管理和服务部署的解决方案。目标是创建一个自适应和自愈的系统。就这些，我现在知道的就是这些。我不确定我将如何做到，也不确定是否能够成功。我所知道的是，我会记录下这段旅程的每一步。
- en: While there will be a lot of theory, this is a hands-on book. You won’t be able
    to complete it by reading it in a metro on the way to work. You’ll have to read
    this book while in front of a computer getting your hands dirty. Eventually, you
    might get stuck and in need of help. Or you might want to write a review or comment
    on the book’s content. Please join the [DevOps20](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/)
    Slack channel and post your thoughts, ask questions, or simply participate in
    a discussion. If you prefer a more one-on-one communication, you can use Slack
    to send me a private message or send an email to viktor@farcic.com. All the books
    I wrote are very dear to me, and I want you to have a good experience reading
    them. Part of that experience is the option to reach out to me. Don’t be shy.

  zh: 尽管本书中有大量理论内容，但它是一本实践书籍。你无法通过在地铁上阅读它来完成。你必须在电脑前动手操作，才能阅读这本书。最终，你可能会卡住，需要帮助。或者，你可能想写一篇评论或对书中的内容发表评论。请加入[DevOps20](http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/)
    Slack频道，发布你的想法，提问，或者简单地参与讨论。如果你更喜欢一对一的交流，可以使用Slack给我发私信，或发送邮件至viktor@farcic.com。所有我写的书对我来说都非常重要，我希望你在阅读它们时有一个愉快的体验。体验的一部分是你可以联系我。不要害羞。
- en: Please note that this, just as the previous book, is self-published. I believe
    that having no intermediaries between the writer and the reader is the best way
    to go. It allows me to write faster, update the book more frequently, and have
    a more direct communication with you. Your feedback is part of the process. No
    matter whether you purchased the book while only a few or all chapters were written,
    the idea is that it will never be truly finished. As time passes, it will require
    updates so that it is aligned with the change in technology or processes. When
    possible, I will try to keep it up to date and release updates whenever that makes
    sense. Eventually, things might change so much that updates are not a good option
    anymore, and that will be a sign that a whole new book is required. **I will keep
    writing as long as I continue getting your support.**

  zh: 请注意，这本书和之前的书一样，是自出版的。我相信，作者和读者之间没有中介是最好的方式。这让我能够更快地写作、更频繁地更新书籍，并与您进行更直接的沟通。你的反馈是过程的一部分。无论你是在书籍只有几章或是全部章节完成时购买的，理念是这本书永远不会真正完成。随着时间的推移，它将需要更新，以便与技术或流程的变化保持一致。当可能时，我会尽力保持其最新，并在合适的时候发布更新。最终，事情可能会发生变化，更新不再是一个好的选择，那时就意味着需要一本全新的书了。**只要你继续支持我，我将继续写作。**
