<html><head></head><body><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>Docker is an open source project with a high-level API that provides software containers to run processes in isolation. Packaging an app in a container that can run on any Linux server (as well as on OS X and Windows) helps developers focus on developing the app instead of server setups and other DevOps operations.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for those who want to learn how to take full advantage of separating services into module containers and connecting them to form a complete platform. You may have, perhaps, heard of Docker but never installed or used it; or, you may have installed it and run a full stack container, not separating services in module containers that connect. In either case, this book will give you all the insights and knowledge required to run your own PaaS.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec05"/>Conventions</h1></div></div></div><p>In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information.
