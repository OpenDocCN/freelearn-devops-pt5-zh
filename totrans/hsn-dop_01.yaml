    stakeholders, departments, groups, and vendors are involved in the overall **software
    development life cycle** (**SDLC**). Most of us are familiar with the stages of
    application life cycle management: the business requirements are gathered by a
    business analyst, then developed by the development team (or could have been outsourced),
    and tested by QA teams (also could have been outsourced) for functionality and
    fitness for purpose. Performance and stress testing were also performed in applicable
    scenarios, by appropriate groups with relevant tools. Then the production deployment
    process, with a checklist and approvals, was managed by the IT teams at the organization,
    followed by monitoring and support by maintenance teams. And we notice that each
    stage of the maturity cycle, from functionality development to usability and maintenance,
    is managed in silos, by independent teams, departments, processes, and tools.
    This approach is often fragmented by techniques, frameworks, processes, people,
    and tools impacting the final product in terms of features, cost, schedule, quality,
    performance, and other administrative overheads such as interfacing and integration
    between vendors. Also, in this method the maintenance, support costs, and skill
    needs are often overlooked. However, both from application life cycle and business
    points of view, maintenance and support activities are key and important to assess,
    evaluate, and estimate well in advance.'

    method of IT management in almost every segment. The technological advances and
    changes are quite profound, rapid, and often intermingled, encompassing multiple
    fields such as agile methodology, DevOps, big data, cloud, and so on. A comprehensive

    organizations. Many institutions have already embarked on this journey towards

    many forms such as, for example, customer data, product data, employee data, and
    so on. Not having the right data on your employees, customers, or products could
    be devastating. It's basic knowledge and common sense that the correct data is
    key to running a business effectively. There is hardly any business today that
    doesn't depend on data-driven decisions; CEOs these days are relying more on data
    for business decisions than ever before, such as which product is more successful
    in the market, how much demand exists area-wise, which price is more competitive,

    operations, such as in a bank, adding new customers or customer transactions with
    the bank through multiple channels such as ATM, online payments, purchases, and
    so on. External sources could be procuring gold exchange rates and foreign exchange
    rates from RBI. These days, social media data is widely used for marketing and
    customer feedback on products. Harnessing the data from all avenues and using

    volumes, velocity, and variety, and delivering value for the business. Data comes
    from multiple sources, such as structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
    The data velocity could be a batch mode, real-time from a machine sensor or online
    server logs, and streaming data in real time. The volumes of data could be terabytes
    or petabytes, which are typically stored on Hadoop-based storage and other open
    source platforms. Big data analytics extends to building social media analytics
    such as market sentiment analysis based on social media data from Twitter, LinkedIn,
    Facebook, and so on; this data is useful to understand customer sentiment and
    support marketing and customer service activities.

    that result in formulating reusable and established formulas. In a similar way,
    data can also be investigated to understand the behavior patterns and meaningful
    insights, through engineering and statistical methods. Hence it can be viewed
    as data + science, or the science of data. Machine learning is a combination of
    data extraction, **extract, transform, load** (**ETL**) or **extract, load, transform**
    (**ELT**) preparation, and using prediction algorithms to derive meaningful patterns
    from data to generate business value. These projects have a development life cycle
    in line with a project or product development. Aligning with DevOps methodologies
    will provide a valuable benefit for the program evolution.
