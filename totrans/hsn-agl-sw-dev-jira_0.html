<p class="calibre2">JIRA software is an Agile project management tool that supports any Agile methodology. From Agile boards to reports, you can plan, track, and manage all your Agile software development projects with a single tool. With this book, you will learn to explore critical Agile terminologies and concepts in the context of JIRA Software.</p>

<p class="calibre2">If you want to get started with JIRA software and learn how to run your JIRA projects the Agile way, this is the perfect book for you.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">What this book covers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2"><a target="_blank" href="part0019.html#I3QM0-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd" class="calibre10">Chapter 1</a>, <em class="calibre8">Get Started with Creating Your Project</em>, is about getting started with creating your project. We'll talk about how projects help you to keep your work organized and learn why JIRA is so popular and where it came from. We'll also talk about creating an account with Atlassian so that you can get started using JIRA on the cloud. We'll look into the projects themselves and how we use a project to organize all work items. We'll then look into the screens, workflows, and permissions, which will allow us to customize our project, and the views, notifications, and permissions that go along with it.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a target="_blank" href="part0032.html#UGI00-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd" class="calibre10">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre8">Managing Work Items</em>, is all about the difference between epics, stories, bugs, and tasks, learning what the different types of issues are, and why we would use each one. We'll talk about the attributes for those issues, learning what these different work item attributes are and how to customize them to fit your needs. We'll also cover managing items in the work, in the backlog, so that all that stuff will be a backlog in JIRA, and we'll talk about how to define, prioritize, and refine it. Then, we'll talk about creating and configuring a board, and how you would do that. If you're familiar with Scrum, you know what I mean by a Scrum board.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a target="_blank" href="part0039.html#1565U0-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd" class="calibre10">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre8">Running Your Project in JIRA</em>, is about running the project. We'll create and start a Sprint. We'll use our backlog to refine the work and then plan and begin the Sprint iteration. We'll also look at the daily Scrum and how we use JIRA to keep the team aligned, and how to know whether we're on track to meet our commitments. We'll focus on the differences between smaller stories or tasks, and when do we use each one, and then we'll talk about how to close a Sprint, and learn how to end that Sprint, and what to do with any work that hasn't been completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a target="_blank" href="part0045.html#1AT9A0-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd" class="calibre10">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre8">Working with Reports</em>, explores all about versions and releases—what they are and how they're different from each other. We'll talk about burndowns, about Sprint reports, and how to read those to determine whether or not your team is doing well. We'll also take a look at velocity charts, which we can use to determine the performance of the team. We will take a look at releasing epic burndowns, as well as versions and epic reports, which give you the ability to do forecasting, which is very powerful.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a target="_blank" href="part0059.html#1O8H60-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd" class="calibre10">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre8">Searching and Filtering on Issues</em>, is about JQL, what it is, how to write queries in JIRA using simple and advanced editors, and how to export your results. We'll talk about saving and managing filters, and then executing bulk changes, and then how to use those filters to create new boards. This will give you new views of your work items in JIRA.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><a target="_blank" href="part0066.html#1UU540-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd" class="calibre10">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre8">Dashboards and Widgets</em>, teaches us what a dashboard is, how you would use it, the different things you can put on a dashboard, the different layouts you can have for it, and then how to share it so that you can ensure that you're able to broadcast the results of the team and how things are going. Hence, there aren't a lot of prerequisites for this course, just a couple of things that I thought would be helpful—one is to have a basic knowledge of Scrum. We'll reference Scrum a fair amount as we're running an Agile project in JIRA, so that would be helpful for you to know. Still, it would be nice to have at least one team of people that are looking to work together, because that's what JIRA is really great for, having a team of people work together, not necessarily just one person working on something. Although it can work for that, having a team that you can apply these concepts to once you've learned them will be really helpful.</p>
