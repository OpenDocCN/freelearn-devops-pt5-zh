- en: Jira Align is purpose-built to connect strategy with execution and provide visibility
    and alignment. Often, connecting strategy with execution is a top-down, bottom-up,
    meet-in-the-middle approach. We've covered the basics from a bottom-up perspective
    in [*Chapter 2*](B16328_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025), *Implementing
    Jira Align*, beginning with connecting to Jira Software, where the tactical execution
    of team-level work items happens. Stories connect to features (Jira epics), then
    to capabilities, portfolio epics, and themes in Jira Align. Once these work item
    levels are connected, you can then harness the power of Jira Align's vast reporting
    capability. For example, you can view spend by theme with the help of the Investment
    vs. Actuals report or track budgets with financial status reports. We'll now examine
    the top-down perspective, beginning with the strategy room.

    model your organization's mission, vision, and values, and specify the long-term
    goals toward which the various work item levels and their associated outcomes
    align. It enables executives to ensure that execution aligns with corporate strategy
    while simultaneously empowering team members with an understanding of the value
    of their work and how it contributes to the enterprise goals.

    to the outcomes shown on the left. For example, there are 10 themes connected

    SAFe defines a value stream as a long-lived series of steps used to create value,
    from concept to the delivery of a tangible result for the customer. Within this
    general definition, there are two kinds of value streams – operational and development.
    Operational value streams deliver end customer value, while development value
    streams build the systems and capabilities that enable operational value streams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    is to bring the music to market using traditional and digital marketing methods.
    We thus identified a development value stream for digital marketing aligned with
    a single program team that delivered systems for online fan engagement contests,
    social media marketing campaigns, delivery of digital marketing assets to business
    partners, and so on.

- en: A word of caution about the phrase *value stream* – it can be ambiguous, as
    it is used in different ways in different contexts. Hereinafter, when we use the
    phrase, we are referring to development value streams. SAFe itself has complicated
    the issue by calling what is now the large solution level the "value stream" level
    in SAFe 4.0\. Jira Align, too, adds to the confusion by referring to the process
    steps that drive kanban boards as a "value stream." Therefore, we have changed
    **Value stream** to **Process steps** in our platform terminology.

    In this sense, they are akin to themes, although they are not objective-based,
    like SAFe themes, nor are they work items, like Jira Align themes. Even so, since
    a value stream object doesn't exist, at least currently, in Jira Align, reporting
    based on themes, such as the Investment by Theme report, could serve as a reasonable
    substitute for value stream budgeting in Jira Align. It's admittedly a workaround,
    but it allows you to capture broad budget allocations and apportion budget by
    percentage across multiple items. We will examine this report shortly.

    context for the portfolio vision and lean budgeting. According to SAFe, they are
    best described in the form of OKRs, with the objective being the theme, and the
    key results being the quantifiable measures of the theme's progress. While SAFe
    considers themes a type of objective, we follow the approach supported by Jira
    Align, where the theme represents a large work item and the OKR represents its
    corresponding business outcomes. This provides a consistent approach, documented
    in [*Chapter 2*](B16328_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025), *Implementing

    the ability to respond to change. The practice of big, upfront planning and budgeting
    of portfolio epics is ineffective, often causing work items to become irrelevant
    by the time they're delivered.

    response to change. One aspect of this approach is to budget only the portion
    of a portfolio epic required to validate a hypothesis. For example, the hypothesis
    that epic delivery will result in enhanced security can be proven by fewer security
    breaches. We will discuss this aspect further in the next section.

    (2011), have gained credibility and popularity over the years. For example, SAFe
    has incorporated them into its LPM approach. Simply put, the lean startup cycle
    of build-measure-learn fosters innovation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    epic and hypothesis statement. A **minimum viable product** (**MVP**) is then
    defined for the epic. The MVP represents the smallest portion of the portfolio
    epic needed to understand whether or not the hypothesis statement is validated.
    The MVP flows through the portfolio kanban to the **Implementing** state. Based
    on whether or not the MVP has proven the hypothesis, the portfolio team then decides
    to either pivot to a new portfolio epic and hypothesis or persevere and continue
    developing the portfolio epic. When the portfolio team's oversight is no longer
    required, they move the portfolio epic to the **Done** state.
