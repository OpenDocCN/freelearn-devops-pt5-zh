<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we'll understand how to get start started with using Jira for your project. We'll start by spending time on planning our Jira installation by asking ourselves relevant questions. We'll set up a Jira cloud instance and a project of the Jira Core type. We'll, of course, start by understanding how to work on a project as a user and we'll cover various aspects of the project interface.</p>
<p class="mce-root">We'll also learn how a new project is created by a Jira Administrator and, as a project manager, how you can ensure that the scheme used in the project is correct and relevant for your requirements. We'll spend some time understanding how to create an issue, work on it, and close it.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Topics covered in this chapter include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting started with Jira</li>
<li>Using Jira Core for business teams</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting started with Jira</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this section, we'll set up a Jira instance that will be used for the rest of this book to learn various aspects of the tool; however, just like when using any tool, we need to ask ourselves some questions regarding its usage and that is why planning is a very important phase that we need to discuss first. We'll quickly set up a Jira instance on Atlassian Cloud to get started on our journey.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Planning your Jira installation</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the beginning, even before starting your journey with Jira, you need to think about your expectations of the tool and ask some questions. Let's discuss these questions that will help you make a wise decision about implementing Jira in your organization.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How many users will be using Jira?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Are you a team of 10 people that need a tool quickly to manage their day-to-day activity or do you work in a company of 10,000 employees, where a tool needs to be rolled our across your organization in several locations?</p>
<p>The number of existing users and the projected number of new users who might join your company need to be clear. This number is extremely important because, based on how many people want to have access to the tool, the right license needs to be bought. Jira licensing is quite straightforward and is based on the number of users. This number will help you in understanding how much Jira will cost you.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What problems are you trying to solve with Jira?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira has various advantages; in <a href="40cf5a29-0d75-4c6c-a7ae-5d0c07c2d024.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introducing Jira</em>, we discussed in detail the benefits that Jira will bring, but whether you want to use Jira for your business or development teams and whatever processes you want to implement in Jira, such as Scrum or Kanban, need to be clear from the beginning.</p>
<p>Jira can be customized for different use cases such as Defect Tracking, Test Management, Change Management, Requirement Management, and Helpdesk. Based on these expectations, your choice of application will be different. More importantly, you should have convincing justification about the benefits that Jira will bring to improve your current efficiency and productivity in the team.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Which application and what apps would you need?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We just discussed that Jira can be customized for a variety of use cases and your expectations from these customizations will help you decide what Jira application you need.</p>
<p>Let's go through some examples of common requirements and possible solutions using the right application and app:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60.3774%"><strong>Your requirements</strong></td>
<td style="width: 38.814%"><strong>Application and apps you would need</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60.3774%">For instance, if your Agile development team is currently struggling with managing their sprints and is looking for a tool for time sheet management.</td>
<td style="width: 38.814%">Jira Software and Tempo Timesheets</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60.3774%">Your legal team of four people currently uses a shared Excel sheet to keep track of all of the cases along with the person handling them and the current status of case.</td>
<td style="width: 38.814%">Jira Core</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="width: 60.3774%">You help desk team is currently receiving around 10-15 tickets from various customers everyday but it's getting difficult for them to effectively manage the support requests.</td>
<td style="width: 38.814%">Jira Service Desk</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p> </p>
<p>Apart from using one of the applications individually, you can also have one instance of Jira running more than one application or all of them. Since these applications are licensed separately, it's better for you to spend time in the beginning identifying which applications you would need.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How many projects do you want to create in Jira?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When using Jira, there's no limit on the number of projects you can create; however, how many projects will use a specific type of application is important. For instance, your Jira instance can have the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two projects using Jira Core</li>
<li>Ten projects using Jira Software</li>
<li>One project using Jira Service Desk</li>
</ul>
<p>In this scenario, you'll have a total of 13 projects but each project can have its own set of configurations that will define how the project will behave. Documenting possible use cases and configurations is invaluable for maintaining your instance. In the future, whenever a new project is created in Jira, it's advisable to use an existing set of configurations and follow a standard across your organization. The number of projects and the type of application it would need is important to also optimize the licenses.</p>
<p>Also, a higher number of projects would mean that there will be lot of issues in your instance and this can be key information in deciding on a deployment option as well; for example, if your Jira is to be used by thousands of users working on millions of issues or tickets, then data center deployment is what you would need.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What will be the projected usage in six months and one year from now?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We just discussed how the number of projects and users in your instances will help you decide on the type of applications and the deployment option, but if you also have plans to scale up the usage of the tool, then buying a sufficient number of licenses in the beginning of the deployment would actually save you more money than upgrading your license tier after six months.</p>
<p>So always do some projects about the projected usage of the tool in the next few years.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integration with other tools</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>One of the best things about Jira is its ability to integrate with other tools, not just from Atlassian but from other third-party vendors as well.</p>
<p>Do you need to integrate with your active directory in the company or do you want Jira to integrate with Confluence, which is an online collaboration tool from Atlassian? Or is there a legacy tool in the company that needs to be pushing data into Jira? There are some integrations such as Jira with Bitbucket or Jira with Confluence that can happen out of the box, but for some integrations; you will need an app or a custom development. Answering these questions will help you decide early on about the apps that you need to buy from the market place or your approach towards using Jira with other tools using development.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Choosing a deployment</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We discussed in detail various deployment options in <a href="40cf5a29-0d75-4c6c-a7ae-5d0c07c2d024.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Introducing Jira</em>, namely, Cloud, Server, and Data Center. To identify which option is more suitable and the best for you, answering the following questions will help you:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Questions</strong></td>
<td><strong>Answer</strong></td>
<td><strong>Suitable deployment</strong></td>

<tr>
<td>
<p>How quickly do you want to get started with Jira?</p>
</td>

<p> </p>
<p>Bear in mind that it's possible to move from the Cloud to the Server model and vice versa later on but it's still better if you answer these questions and evaluate the best deployment for your organization.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up a Cloud instance</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This book is a quick start guide on Jira and that's why we'll be using a Cloud instance of Jira till the end of this guide.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to sign up for Atlassian Jira Cloud:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Open the following link to evaluate Jira Core: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/core/try">https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/core/try</a>.</li>
<li>Click on the Try it free button at the bottom-left as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>

<p>Figure 1: Evaluate Jira Core</p>
<ol start="3">
<li> On the new screen, sign up for an evaluation on Atlassian Cloud. Complete Claim your site, Full name, Email, and Password and click on the Sign up button.</li>
<li>Your Jira instance on Atlassian Cloud will then be set up for you.</li>
<li>On the next screen, select your preferred language and click on the Continue button.</li>
<li>On the next set of screens, you'll be asked to upload your avatar picture.</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations, you now have a new Jira instance set up on Atlassian Cloud. You can evaluate this instance free of cost for one week. After that, you will need to buy the license. If you're evaluating Jira for the very first time, using the Atlassian Cloud version is a great way to get familiar with its features.</p>
<p>If you want to evaluate Jira further, then you can either purchase a starter license that will cost $10 per month for 10 users or you can evaluate Jira Server-on-premise for one month and then pay a $10 one-time fee for 10 users.</p>
<p>If you're purely evaluating Jira and you need more time, then you always sign up for a new account free of cost.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Jira Core for business teams</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Great work, you have a Cloud instance of Jira ready. Now let's first get familiar with the basic features of the tool. Let's quickly create a project in Jira Core.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a new project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's now create a new project in Jira:</p>
<ol>
<li>On the Welcome screen, click on the Create sample project button, as shown in the following:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/61a14f45-b812-47f4-9557-526861230ce7.png" style="width:45.75em;height:19.50em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>On the Create project with sample data screen, you'll be asked to select a template, which in this case would just be Project management, as we just have the Jira Core application in our instance. When we install Jira Software and Jira Service Desk, then more templates will appear in this screen. Click on the Next button:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d3944845-7da5-480e-be1d-de851c3f9d3b.png" style="width:33.67em;height:13.00em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>The next screen will ask you to provide some information. Enter the Name as Human Resource; the Key will automatically be set to HR but you can change it if you want; and Project lead will be your name but, when you add more people in your instance, you'll select their names. Finally, click on the Submit button to create the project.</li>
<li>Your first project will be created for you, similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/6859fa54-507f-4a23-b0ef-09ba1f7515c6.png" style="width:57.33em;height:44.00em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 4</p>
<p>Let's now explore various features in a Jira Core project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Working on a Jira Core project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We now have a new project called Human Resource in our Jira instance. Each project in Jira also has a Project Key, which in our case is HR. A project in Jira is a container of issues, which are just nothing but tickets or different activities.</p>
<p>The project sidebar shown on the left side of the project has links to sections related to the current project. In a Jira Core project, there are links to Summary, Board, Issues and filters, and Reports.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As you might have guessed already, this section contains a summary of what's happening in your project. The purpose of this section is to give you a bird's-eye view of what's happening in the project.</p>
<p>There are two tabs on this screen—Activity and Statistics.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Activity</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A project in Jira is always evolving and things are changing in it. New issues are added to the project, people are adding comments on them, and issues are being resolved as well, as shown in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7c2c492f-7a43-4e84-91c7-8db28512f63b.png" style="width:61.08em;height:33.58em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, the latest comments are displayed in the center of the page and, on the right-hand side, there's information about the Project lead, a count of Issue Status per workflow status, and a similar count based on Priority.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Statistics</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are various fields in a Jira issue that help us identify problems better and plan them accordingly, such as Priority, Status, and Component.</p>
<p>This page will display a breakdown of issues with counts and percentages of issues for various issue attributes, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/333e4103-823f-4e9c-b916-bab6c6e0b88d.png" style="width:41.33em;height:50.58em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>As more issues are added in the project, this section will become more useful with handy links to take you directly to a list of issues.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This section has three columns—To Do, In Progress, and Done. It's a great way to visualize the work happening in the project. As people in the project start working, they can drag the issue from one column to another. This board here will help all of the team members by displaying the most up-to-date status.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Issues and filters</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A project can have hundreds or thousands of issues and searching these issues or finding them easily could become a challenge; that's why this section in the project will help you to quickly search for the issues.</p>
<p>Click on Issues and filters | All issues as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/024e402f-2254-46da-b458-26b424a72468.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 7</p>
<p>On the sidebar on the left-hand side, you can see all of the ready-made filters for your project such as My open issues, Reported by me, and All issues. Clicking on these will take you to a list of all of the issues that fulfill the criteria in that filter.</p>
<p>All of the issues in a specific filter are listed here; click on any of the issues and its details will open up on the right-hand side. You can do lot of things here such as change the status of the issue, add a comment, create more sub-tasks, and attach files.</p>
<p>There are other ways to find issues relevant to you but if you are inside a project then the scope of the issues in the Issues and filters section is limited to that project only.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once you start using a project in Jira, you also want to know the progress of your work and you want to analyze the information in the project. Jira comes with ready-made reports out of the box to help you look at your data in a graphical way.</p>
<p>In the project sidebar, click on the reports and you'll be taken to the All reports section as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>

<p>Most of these reports are self explanatory and I highly recommend you click on any of these reports to understand what it offers; however, in <a href="bc4fa2c2-d2fd-4942-9b9b-e289cffe6f9e.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Reports and Dashboards</em>, we'll take an in-depth look at these reports that come with a project and we'll spend time understanding how these reports can be displayed on a dashboard so that you can mix-and match the reports that are important for you or your team on your own custom dashboard.</p>

<p>After getting familiar with the interface of a Jira Core project, let's now create an issue in our project, understand how to work on that issue, and finally close that issue once it's complete.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to create a new issue and work on it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the Create issue icon on the sidebar on left-hand side as shown:</li>
</ol>

<p>Figure 9</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>You'll be presented with a <strong>Create issue</strong> screen. Please fill in the relevant fields on this form such as Issue Type as Task, Summary, Attachment, Due date, Description, Assignee, Priority, Labels, Original Estimate, and Remaining Estimate and then click on the Create button. Apart from these system fields, more custom fields can also be created in Jira. The fields, their order, and whether they are mandatory or not can be customized as shown:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>The new issue will be created and listed in both your Summary and Board sections. Click on the issue link and you'll then be taken to the Issue View screen, as shown in the following screenshot, where you can work on the issue:</li>
</ol>

<p>Figure 11</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>On the Issue View screen, you can look at all of the available details of an issue. For instance, on top you have some buttons such as Edit, Comment, Assign, Start Progress, Done, and Admin. In the main section of the issue, you can view various fields by user such as the Type of an issue, which is in this case a Task; the Status of the issue; Priority; Resolution; and Labels. On the right side, you have information about Assignee and Reporter. This view basically displays all of the fields and lets you work on the issue.</li>
<li>Click on the Start Progress button on top, which is nothing but a workflow transition. The Status will now be changed from TO DO to  IN PROGRESS as shown in the following:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="6">
<li>If you click on the Done button then the Status of the issues will be changed to Done and the Resolution will be changed to Done as well.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root">Congratulations, you've just learned how to work on a Jira issue from start to finish. Instead of going to the Issue View screen, you could also have worked on this issue from your Board as well by simply dragging the issue from one column to another.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we first asked ourselves some important questions that helped us to plan our Jira installation, then we learned how to quickly get started with using Jira Core on Cloud by first signing up for a Cloud instance and then creating a project in our application. We finally spent time understanding how to work on an issue from start to finish.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we'll understand how Jira Software works; we'll first quickly go through Agile concepts and then we'll learn to create both Scrum and Kanban boards. Finally, we'll take a look at key Agile reports.</p>
