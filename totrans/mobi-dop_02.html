<p>In the last chapter, we learned what DevOps means for the application development life cycle, and the key differences between DevOps and mobile DevOps, while also exploring the challenges faced in applying DevOps to the mobile app development cycle.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will be exploring code repository systems, as the title of the chapter suggests. We will discuss various versioning tools available and focus mainly on Git to get into detailed steps for source versioning and we'll be using that as our code repository in examples throughout the book.</p>
<p>Some of the topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Varieties of version control</li>
<li>Source code management</li>
<li>Using Git to create a repository for your project</li>
<li>Creating an account with GitHub</li>
<li>Managing users and groups</li>
<li>Configuring SSH keys</li>
</ul>

<p>In the mobile DevOps life cycle, one of the first phases is application development. Coding is one of the most important parts of the development life cycle, and managing that code is even more important in the long term.</p>
<p>When developers are continuously coding an application, managing that code becomes troublesome if not done properly. As the development progresses, code merges are more frequent and, with time, the development team grows quickly and more people need to integrate code with other developers.</p>
<p>Source code management becomes tricky and a very important part to focus on in order to ensure seamless development and code integration.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Need for source code management</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Let's take a real-world example of application development in a small company. The team is of two people initially. The team starts coding the application and keeps their code in their local machines.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, both the developers share their changes and integrate their code.</p>
<p>Everything goes fine at this point, because it is easy for two developers to check the files, merge their code, and copy files. After some time, two more people join the development team and now they need to manage and merge their code and make changes every day.</p>
<p>These are the challenges the team now face:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Code merge issues</strong>: Whenever new developers make changes in the code files, they'll have to share their files with five different developers. This could create a lot of unmanaged code changes that are not properly synced. In this manual process of code merging, it is possible that some changes might be missed.</li>
<li><strong>Time wasted in manual checks</strong>: There is a lot of time wasted in the manual process of checking the code changes and making sure all the changes are merged, manual copy-pasting, and again verifying that everything is properly integrated, making sure no changes are missed, and then building again manually to ensure the changes do not fail the build.</li>
<li><strong>No record of code changes</strong>: In the manual process of code merging, there is no record of the changes made by developers. There is a very high chance that a code change might break some functionality and it will not be discovered until late in the development process. There is no track of who made which change in the code, and this makes troubleshooting much more time-consuming and difficult.</li>
<li><strong>No one place for the latest code</strong>: Because code is not regularly checked in to any central repository, it creates dependency over developers and makes it difficult to transfer codebases to new systems and teams.</li>
<li><strong>Distributed development</strong>: When the team expands and becomes a distributed team working from different locations, which is quite normal in today's world, code merging and change tracking become a big challenge if you don't have a source code management solution. Developers make code changes from different places and need to merge them; this gets challenging since now they need to merge the code every day with all team members and it cannot be done by simple file sharing systems. A lot of tracking and merging is required in such a process.</li>
<li><strong>Source versioning:</strong> Source versioning is another issue when talking about source code management. Without a SCM tool, developers would have to manually maintain folders of different versions of code and make sure everybody uses the same structure, and the integrations must be done in the same way. SCM tools solve this problem by providing options to make branches and tags for different releases and features, thus making the source versioning process simple, easy to follow, and seamless.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many such issues that require a code repository system to ensure code quality, track changes, seamlessly merge code, and integrate development between developers. This is where source code management and code repository systems come into play.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>These are some common terms used in source code management and version control systems. They are usually widespread and standard terms used by most control systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Branch</strong>: It is a revision of the main code where developers can make a change and then can merge it with the main code later. Branches can be used to maintain different features and to keep different releases and versions. Tags also come in the same category and have a similar use.</li>
<li><strong>Change</strong>: Change represents a modification in the source code files and is tracked by the source version control system.</li>
<li><strong>Checkout</strong>: Checking out source code means to make a local copy of the repository code on your machine. It can also mean to get the latest code.</li>
<li><strong>Clone</strong>: Cloning is similar to checking out, except it is mostly used when you are cloning the remote repository into an empty local repository.</li>
<li><strong>Commit</strong>: Commit is the same as in other systems; it is basically pushing your local copy or working copy changes to the remote repository.</li>
<li><strong>Conflict</strong>: Conflict occurs when different developers make changes to the same source file and mostly at the same place in the file. Some difference checking tools, such as KDiff, can be used to compare documents and make sure conflicts are not overridden.</li>
<li><strong>Merge</strong>: Merging is typically done when a developer makes changes to a file that has been changed by other developers as well, and then he has to check his code into the repository. In these kinds of scenario, SCM tools usually give warnings that the code file has some changes by other developers and your changes will be merged into theirs. Other times, a similar situation can be resolved by merging changes manually to avoid conflicts, or taking the latest changes from the repository and then merging locally before checking in the code.</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Since there are different requirements for different projects, and whether your project is centralized or distributed, different types of source code management might be required for different teams and organizations. Some organizations might require it to be in one place, while others want their code base to be distributed and not maintained in a single place.</p>
<p>Keeping all those scenarios in mind, there are two types of source code management tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Centralized version control</li>
<li>Distributed version control</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As the name suggests, centralized version control means there is a single central copy of our project code on the server and developers commit their changes to this central repository. In this kind of version control system, developers can check out their required source code files, but never have an entire local copy. One of the most common and well-known examples of this is <strong>SVN</strong>.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Distributed version control is the opposite of centralized version control systems. In distributed version control systems, developers don't depend upon a central repository server to store all the version-related information and project files. They clone the repository onto their local machine, which contains all the versioning and branching information for the project source code. One of the most commonly used distributed systems is <strong>Git</strong>, and we'll be going deep into using Git as a source versioning tool in this chapter.</p>

<p>As we described earlier, repositories are a place to manage and share your project code. Git allows you to create public or private repositories. Public repositories are open for everybody, but you can include a license file that explains how you want the project to be shared with others.</p>
<p>Follow these steps to create a repository on GitHub:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open a web browser, go to <a href="https://github.com/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://github.com/</span></a>, and sign up for a new account by providing a username for your account and your email and password. You can skip this step if you already have an account on GitHub:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7cfacea7-6ab3-45cb-ae33-b87db757e8c9.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Once the signup is done, go to <a href="https://github.com/login"><span class="URLPACKT">https://github.com/login</span></a> and sign in to your newly created account on GitHub:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/93455d3d-4ed2-43e8-8887-d917d3bad14a.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Once signed in, in the upper-right corner of the page, click <span class="packt_screen">+</span> and then click <span class="packt_screen">New repository</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ab0c73b6-35be-4bfa-b508-e6eeb8f37589.png"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>On the next screen, give a name for your repository and optionally add a description. Also, check <span class="packt_screen">Initialize this repository with a README</span> and then click on the <span class="packt_screen">Create repository</span> button:</li>
</ol>

<p>Installing Git on Windows is as simple as installing any GUI-based application. Follow the steps to install Git on Windows:</p>
<ol>
<li>To download the latest Git for Windows installer, go to <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"><span class="URLPACKT">https://git-scm.com/downloads</span></a>. Select <span class="packt_screen">Windows</span> and the download will start:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/cb4c0d1f-fc1a-45a6-b08a-582ee8841415.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Once downloaded, start the installer file.</li>
<li>The next screen will ask you to accept the license. Click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>.</li>
<li>Provide the path for the Git installation; you can leave the default path as-is if you like and click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>The next screen is where you select how you would like to use Git on your system. There are multiple options provided. The first option lets you use Git from Git Bash, which is a command line for Git. The second option lets you user Git commands from both Git Bash and the Windows Command Prompt, which is great and adds flexibility to your use of Git. It is best to select the second option and click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/62f4754a-67b1-4796-93d7-3ba283c7e67d.png"/></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>Next, we'll be choosing the OpenSSH client for remote connection, which is the default for Git:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/034d00ac-9c7a-4752-9216-548dca699c2f.png"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Select the SSL library to be used for HTTPS connections. You can leave the default as-is, or change it according to your needs; click <span class="packt_screen">Next</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/c1431cfa-8a40-4912-b9de-4dcbee1a0c15.png"/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Select line ending styles to be used by Git while checking out your code and committing. You have to make a choice, because developers could be using different systems, such as Windows and Linux, for development purposes and line ending styles vary in different systems. So, keeping the same line ending style for commits is always recommended:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/ef1d6270-15a3-4db5-a320-95d63a0de479.png"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Select the terminal emulator to be used for Git Bash to run commands; MinTTY is more flexible and is the default option:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/bee740ea-d753-4fa7-afe1-04407389e749.png"/></div>
<ol start="10">
<li>In the final step, select all the features you would like to enable and click <span class="packt_screen">Install</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f3f15edb-21f6-4899-83c2-4ba1ee5e2d21.png"/></div>
<ol start="11">
<li>Once the files are extracted into the <kbd>path</kbd> folder and installation is complete, click <span class="packt_screen">Finish</span>:</li>
<li>Now, open a command prompt or Git Bash and run the following commands to set your username and email to be configured:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7318c09e-7211-48c3-abca-9d6e92bed089.png"/></div>
<p>Git installation is now completed, and the user's identity is configured to be used for commits.</p>

<li>From your shell, install Git using the <kbd>apt-get</kbd> command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ sudo apt-get update</strong>
<strong>$ sudo apt-get install git</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>Verify the installation was successful by typing <kbd>git --version</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git --version</strong>
<strong>git version 2.9.2</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Configure your Git username and email for a single repository:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ git config --global user.name "firstname lastname"</strong>
<strong>$ git config --global user.email "email@gmail.com"</strong>  </pre>
<ol start="4">
<li>Install the necessary dependencies using the <kbd>apt-get</kbd> command:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext libz-dev libssl-dev asciidoc xmlto docbook2x</strong>  </pre>

<p>To configure and set up SSH keys for your GitHub account, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Check whether you already have an <kbd>ssh</kbd> key pair.</li>
<li>Open Git Bash and enter <kbd>ls -al ~/.ssh</kbd> to see whether existing SSH keys are present:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px"><strong>$ ls -al ~/.ssh</strong>  </pre>

<ol start="3">
<li>The public key consists of the <kbd>.pub</kbd> extension. Create a new key pair (skip this step if you already have a key pair).</li>
<li>Open Git Bash and paste in the following text, substituting your GitHub email address for the one shown:</li>
