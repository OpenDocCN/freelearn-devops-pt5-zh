Most of us are familiar with the stages of application life cycle management: the business requirements are gathered by a business analyst, then developed by the development team (or could have been outsourced), and tested by QA teams (also could have been outsourced) for functionality and fitness for purpose. Performance and stress testing were also performed in applicable scenarios, by appropriate groups with relevant tools. Then the production deployment process, with a checklist and approvals, was managed by the IT teams at the organization, followed by monitoring and support by maintenance teams. And we notice that each stage of the maturity cycle, from functionality development to usability and maintenance, is managed in silos, by independent teams, departments, processes, and tools. This approach is often fragmented by techniques, frameworks, processes, people, and tools impacting the final product in terms of features, cost, schedule, quality, performance, and other administrative overheads such as interfacing and integration between vendors. Also, in this method the maintenance, support costs, and skill needs are often overlooked. However, both from application life cycle and business points of view, maintenance and support activities are key and important to assess, evaluate, and estimate well in advance.</p><p class="calibre8">In this lesson, we will cover the following topics:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Introduction to DevOps</li><li class="listitem">Business application of DevOps.</li><li class="listitem">Business drivers/market trends</li><li class="listitem">DevOps strategy</li><li class="listitem">Benefits of DevOps</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">Many technological innovations have taken place to challenge the traditional method of IT management in almost every segment. The technological advances and changes are quite profound, rapid, and often intermingled, encompassing multiple fields such as agile methodology, DevOps, big data, cloud, and so on. A comprehensive and holistic approach will undoubtedly be rewarding and derive maximum value for organizations. Many institutions have already embarked on this journey towards the future, adopting these technologies.</p><p class="calibre8">The pre-DevOps software development challenges are reluctant to change in systems; deployments fraught with risk, lack of consistency across environments (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">it works on my machine</strong></span> syndrome), the impact of silos--toss problems across <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">the wall</strong></span> such as teams resulting in duplication of effort, skill sets, and in-fighting. To mitigate the mentioned issues and bridge this gap DevOps emerged as a popular choice.</p><p class="calibre8">DevOps (Development plus Operations) has recently taken center stage in the SDLC. DevOps offers process frameworks augmented with open source tools to integrate all the phases of the application life cycle, and ensure they function as a cohesive unit. It helps to align and automate the process across the phases of development, testing, deployment, and support. It includes best practices such as code repositories, build automation, continuous deployment, and others.</p><p class="calibre8">DevOps adoption for systems including big data systems and projects is a cultural shift compared to traditional development cycles. The purpose of this book is to put forth the concepts and adoption strategy for an organization, covering the technology areas of DevOps, big data, cloud, data science, in-memory technology, and others. Adopting and adhering to DevOps practices will be rewarding for any organization and allow it to improve on its performance and efficiency.</p><p class="calibre8">Acceptance of open source tools for each segment of IT functionality, their popularity, and versatility, is increasing day by day, across the world. As a matter of fact, many new tool variants have been introduced to the market for each segment. The open source tools for DevOps are major contributors to the success of DevOps' adoption in the market by institutions, which is discussed in detail in coming sections.</p><p class="calibre8">As we can see, across industries DevOps adoption has seen steady growth year on year:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00001.jpeg" alt="Introduction to DevOps" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre8">DevOps penetration in enterprises shows a healthy trend, as per the following figure:</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00002.jpeg" alt="Introduction to DevOps" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div>

We lack a single version of the truth. Code review feedback is through emails and not recorded, leading to confusion and rework.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Consistent configuration management</strong></span>: We develop, test, and build source code on different systems. Validating the platforms and compatibility versions of dependencies is manual and error-prone. It's really challenging to ensure all the systems speak the same language, and have the same versions of the tools, compilers, and so on. Our code works fine on build systems but doesn't when moved to production systems, causing embarrassment regarding business deliverables, and cost overheads to react.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Product readiness to markets</strong></span>: We have a process to develop code, test, and build through defined timelines. There are many manual checks and validations in the process; the integrations between different groups cause our commitments and delivery dates to be unpredictable. We wish to know how close our product is to delivery and its quality periodically, to plan in advance rather than being reactive.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Automation of manual processes</strong></span>: We are following manual processes, which are often error prone, and wish to enhance efficiency by following an automation process wherever applicable. Testing cycle automation, incremental testing, and integrating with the build cycle will expedite product quality, the release cycle, and infrastructure service automation such as creating, starting, stopping, deleting, terminating, and restarting virtual or bare-metal machines.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Containers</strong></span>: Portability of code is the primary challenge. The code works in development and QA environments, but moving to production systems causes multiple challenges such as code not compiling due to dependency issues, build break down, and so on. Building platform agnostic code is a challenge, and maintaining multiple platform versions of development and QA platforms is a huge overhead. Portable container code would alleviate these kinds of issues.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">On-premise challenges</strong></span>: We have many on-premise systems. There are multiple challenges, from capacity planning to turnaround time. The Capex and operational expenses are unpredictable. Cloud migration seems to have multiple choices and vendors, so there needs to be an efficient adoption method to ensure results.</li></ul></div></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Business drivers for DevOps adoption to big data">
<div class="book" title="Data explosion"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch01lvl2sec01" class="calibre1"/>Data explosion</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Data is the new form of currency</strong></span>--yes you read right, it's as much a valuable asset as oil and gold. In the past decade, many companies realized the potential of data as an invaluable asset to their growth and performance.</p><p class="calibre8">Let's understand how data is valuable. For any organization, data could be in many forms such as, for example, customer data, product data, employee data, and so on. Not having the right data on your employees, customers, or products could be devastating. Its basic knowledge and common sense that the correct data is key to running a business effectively. There is hardly any business today that doesn't depend on data-driven decisions; CEOs these days are relying more on data for business decisions than ever before, such as which product is more successful in the market, how much demand exists area-wise, which price is more competitive, and so on.</p><p class="calibre8">Data can be generated through multiple sources, internal, external, and even social media. Internal data is the data generated through internal systems and operations, such as in a bank, adding new customers or customer transactions with the bank through multiple channels such as ATM, online payments, purchases, and so on. External sources could be procuring gold exchange rates and foreign exchange rates from RBI. These days, social media data is widely used for marketing and customer feedback on products. Harnessing the data from all avenues and using it intelligently is key for business success.</p><p class="calibre8">Going a step further, a few companies even monetize data, for example, Healthcare IQ, Owens &amp; Minor, State Street Global Corporation, Ad Juggler, comScore, Verisk Analytics, Nielsen, and LexisNexis. These organizations buy raw data such as web analytics on online product sales, or online search records for each brand, reprocess the data into an organized format, and sell it to research analysts or organizations looking for competitor intelligence data to reposition their products in markets.</p><p class="calibre8">Let's analyze the factors fueling the growth of data and business. Fundamental changes in market and customer behavior have had a significant impact on the data explosion. Some of the key drivers of change are:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Customer preference</strong></span>: Today, customers have many means of interacting with businesses; for example, a bank provides multiple channels such as ATM withdrawals, online banking, mobile banking, card payments, on-premise banking, and so on. The same is true for purchases; these can be in the shop, online, mobile-based, and so on, which organizations have to maintain for business operations. So, these multiple channels contribute to increased data management.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Social media</strong></span>: Data is flooding in from social media such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter. On the one hand, they are social interaction sites between individuals; on the other hand, companies also rely on social media to socialize their products. The data posted in terabytes/petabytes, in turn, is used by many organizations for data mining too. This is contributing to the huge data explosion.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Regulations</strong></span>: Companies are required to maintain data in proper formats for a stipulated time, as required by regulatory bodies. For example, to combat money laundering, each organization dealing with finance is required to have clear customer records and credentials to share with regulatory authorities over extended periods of time, such as 10 to 15 years.</li><li class="listitem"><span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Digital world</strong></span>: As we move towards the paperless digital world, we keep adding more digital data, such as e-books and ERP applications to automate many tasks and avoid paperwork. These innovations are generating much of the digital data growth as well.</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">The next generation will be more data intensive, with the Internet of Things and data science at the forefront, driving business and customer priorities.</p></div></div>

<div class="book" title="Cloud computing"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h2 class="title1" id="calibre_pb_2"><a id="ch01lvl2sec02" class="calibre1"/>Cloud computing</h2></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Acceptance of cloud platforms as the de facto service line has brought many changes to procuring and managing infrastructure. Provisioning hardware and other types of commodity work on the cloud is also important for improving efficiency, as moving these IT functions to the cloud enhances the efficiency of services, and allows IT departments to shift their focus away from patching operating systems. DevOps with cloud adoption is the most widely implemented popular option. With cloud penetration, addition of infrastructure/servers is just a click away. This, along with credible open source tools, has paved the way for DevOps.</p><p class="calibre8">In a fraction of time, build, QA, and pre-prod machines can be added as exact replicas and configurations as required, using open source tools.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00003.jpeg" alt="Cloud computing" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div></div>

Data comes from multiple sources, such as structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. The data velocity could be a batch mode, real-time from a machine sensor or online server logs, and streaming data in real time. The volumes of data could be terabytes or petabytes, which are typically stored on Hadoop-based storage and other open source platforms. Big data analytics extends to building social media analytics such as market sentiment analysis based on social media data from Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook, and so on; this data is useful to understand customer sentiment and support marketing and customer service activities.</p></div></div>

We are familiar with science; we understand the features, behavior patterns, and meaningful insights that result in formulating reusable and established formulas. In a similar way, data can also be investigated to understand the behavior patterns and meaningful insights, through engineering and statistical methods. Hence it can be viewed as data + science, or the science of data. Machine learning is a combination of data extraction, <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">extract, transform, load</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">ETL</strong></span>) or <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">extract, load, transform</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">ELT</strong></span>) preparation, and using prediction algorithms to derive meaningful patterns from data to generate business value. These projects have a development life cycle in line with a project or product development. Aligning with DevOps methodologies will provide a valuable benefit for the program evolution.</p></div></div>
