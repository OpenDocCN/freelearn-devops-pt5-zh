    your project. We'll start by spending time on planning our Jira installation by
    asking ourselves relevant questions. We'll set up a Jira cloud instance and a
    project of the Jira Core type. We'll, of course, start by understanding how to
    work on a project as a user and we'll cover various aspects of the project interface.

    a project manager, how you can ensure that the scheme used in the project is correct
    and relevant for your requirements. We'll spend some time understanding how to
    create an issue, work on it, and close it.

    of this book to learn various aspects of the tool; however, just like when using
    any tool, we need to ask ourselves some questions regarding its usage and that
    is why planning is a very important phase that we need to discuss first. We'll
    quickly set up a Jira instance on Atlassian Cloud to get started on our journey.

    about your expectations of the tool and ask some questions. Let's discuss these
    questions that will help you make a wise decision about implementing Jira in your
    organization.

    be rolled our across your organization in several locations?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The number of existing users and the projected number of new users who might
    join your company need to be clear. This number is extremely important because,
    based on how many people want to have access to the tool, the right license needs
    to be bought. Jira licensing is quite straightforward and is based on the number
    of users. This number will help you in understanding how much Jira will cost you.

    Jira*, we discussed in detail the benefits that Jira will bring, but whether you
    want to use Jira for your business or development teams and whatever processes
    you want to implement in Jira, such as Scrum or Kanban, need to be clear from
    the beginning.

    Management, Change Management, Requirement Management, and Helpdesk. Based on
    these expectations, your choice of application will be different. More importantly,

    however, how many projects will use a specific type of application is important.
    For instance, your Jira instance can have the following scenarios:'

- en: In this scenario, you'll have a total of 13 projects but each project can have
    its own set of configurations that will define how the project will behave. Documenting
    possible use cases and configurations is invaluable for maintaining your instance.
    In the future, whenever a new project is created in Jira, it's advisable to use
    an existing set of configurations and follow a standard across your organization.
    The number of projects and the type of application it would need is important
    to also optimize the licenses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, a higher number of projects would mean that there will be lot of issues
    in your instance and this can be key information in deciding on a deployment option
    as well; for example, if your Jira is to be used by thousands of users working
    on millions of issues or tickets, then data center deployment is what you would
    need.

    help you decide on the type of applications and the deployment option, but if
    you also have plans to scale up the usage of the tool, then buying a sufficient
    number of licenses in the beginning of the deployment would actually save you
    more money than upgrading your license tier after six months.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    want Jira to integrate with Confluence, which is an online collaboration tool
    from Atlassian? Or is there a legacy tool in the company that needs to be pushing
    data into Jira? There are some integrations such as Jira with Bitbucket or Jira
    with Confluence that can happen out of the box, but for some integrations; you
    will need an app or a custom development. Answering these questions will help
    you decide early on about the apps that you need to buy from the market place
    or your approach towards using Jira with other tools using development.
