- en: DevOps and big data are most sought-after technology trends bringing multifold
    benefits to business, industries, and R and D centers. Their widespread adoption
    is associated with the popularity and acceptance of Open source tools along with
    other technology advancements, such as cloud computing, containers, and the Internet
    of Things.

- en: In this book, we will discuss the business drivers and market trends contributing
    to the evolution of technology. We will explore the key technological concepts,
    such as NoSQL databases,  microservices, data science, and data visualization.
    We will build big data enterprise applications, using core architectural principles,
    based on the Spark in-memory engine. We will discuss DevOps practices and frameworks,
    and their application with popular tools, to prepare for continuous integration,
    continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. We will dive deeper into the popular
    open source tools, such as Chef, Ansible, Jenkins, Git, and Stack, which assist
    in the automation of the development to deployment cycle.

    offerings with the key components and differences. This will provide the reader
    with information to aid their decision making. The technology choices discussed
    are for Hadoop platforms, cloud offerings, container and orchestration services,
    Internet of Things platforms, and NoSQL databases. The choice of popular tools
    for continuous integration, delivery, deployment, and monitoring is also thoroughly
    discussed. There are topics on capacity planning for Hadoop cluster, and security
    models for data and cloud based, discussed to provide reader with comprehensive
    knowledge on these subjects.
