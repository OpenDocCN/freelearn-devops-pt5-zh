It is used to track bugs, resolve issues, and manage project functions. There are many such tools available in the market, but the best thing about JIRA is that it can be easily configured and it offers a wide range of customizations. Out of the box, JIRA offers defect/bug tracking functionalities, but it can also be customized to act like a helpdesk system, a simple test management suite, or a project management system with end-to-end traceability.</p><p>This chapter offers a brief introduction to JIRA and the new features of JIRA 7, mainly the three variants <strong>JIRA Core</strong>, <strong>JIRA</strong> <strong>Software</strong>, and <strong>JIRA Service Desk</strong>. Emphasis is given to planning, installing, and setting up JIRA. After reading this chapter, you should understand how to plan your JIRA installation and ensure the longevity of its installation so that it can accommodate more users and data in the future. We will begin with a questionnaire that needs to be answered before you can deploy a JIRA instance in your company. You will learn about the system and hardware requirements to run JIRA for an enterprise. The installation procedure for Windows and Linux operating systems is discussed briefly and the setup wizard is explained in detail in this chapter.</p><p>Topics covered in this chapter include:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What is new in JIRA 7?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Planning your JIRA installation</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">System requirements</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Setting up the MySQL database</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The JIRA setup wizard</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">JIRA directory structure, startup/shutdown scripts, and log files</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Planning your upgrade</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Updating JIRA add-ons</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Applications, uses, and examples</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">JIRA core concepts</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec7"/>What is new in JIRA 7?</h1></div></div></div><p>The much awaited JIRA 7 was released in October 2015 and it is now offered in three different application variants:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">JIRA Core</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">JIRA Software</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">JIRA Service Desk</li></ul></div><p>Let us discuss each one of them separately.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec8"/>JIRA Core</h2></div></div></div><p>This comprises of the base application of JIRA that you might be familiar with, of course with some new features. JIRA Core is a simplified version of JIRA features that we have been using up until the 6.x versions.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec9"/>JIRA Software</h2></div></div></div><p>This comprises of all the features of JIRA Core and JIRA Agile. From JIRA 7 onwards, JIRA Agile will no longer be offered as an add-on. You will not be able to install JIRA Agile from the marketplace.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec10"/>JIRA Service Desk</h2></div></div></div><p>This comprises of all the features of JIRA Core and JIRA Service Desk. Just like JIRA Software, JIRA Service Desk will no longer be offered as an add-on and you cannot install it from the marketplace.</p><p>This split of applications was done by Atlassian, keeping in mind the usage of JIRA in various organizations across the globe, and it makes it very simple for the companies to choose the right application suitable for their needs. However, it doesn't mean that all three applications (JIRA Core, JIRA Agile, and JIRA Service Desk) can't be used on the same instance. You can certainly buy JIRA Software and later install the JIRA Service Desk application on it.</p><p>Apart from this split, JIRA 7 brings new features such as <strong>Release Hub</strong>, with real-time status of the versions, an improved sidebar where you can add your own shortcuts, better reporting, and visibility of development tools. We will discuss and highlight these improvements in the relevant chapters in this book.</p><p>In this book, we will install JIRA Software that comes in-built with JIRA Agile, and later we will install JIRA Service Desk on top of it.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec8"/>Planning your JIRA installation</h1></div></div></div><p>There are certain points to be kept in mind before you install JIRA in the production phase and deploy it. The points that are discussed here should ideally be a part of your JIRA questionnaire, which you will prepare and fill in after discussion with the product owners and project managers. This will not only help you to plan your installation for now, but it will also give you a good idea about the future usage of the tool.</p><p>From the very beginning, start preparing the documents to store all the following information:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Number of users</strong>: This is the most important thing that the JIRA administrator should worry about. If you are using a limited user license in JIRA, then you should know the number of users who are using JIRA currently and who will be using it a few months down the line. In enterprise systems, there is no limit defined in the license on the number of active users accessing the system, but it's important to worry about various aspects that are discussed here:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Are users part of a single team or several teams? It's also possible to give limited access of your JIRA instance to clients and third-party vendors.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">If users are part of several teams working with different groups, then is there a need to limit the visibility of projects within these groups?</li></ul></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Number of projects</strong>: The JIRA license will not put any limit on the number of projects. You can create any number of projects irrespective of whether you use 10 users' licenses or 100 users' licenses. The more the number of projects means a lot of issues will be stored in the database and a lot of schemes will have to be managed by administrators. It's good to know the tentative number of projects that will be stored in JIRA.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>JIRA server hardware recommendation</strong>: The hardware required to run JIRA depends on the number of variables, such as the number of users, number of projects, traffic, and number of schemes used in JIRA:<div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For approximately 50 projects and 100 users, with less than 5,000 issues—16 GB RAM and a multicore CPU.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">For approximately 100 projects and 3,000 users, with less than 100,000 issues—32 GB RAM, 2 Intel (R) Xeon (R), and CPU E5520 @ 2.27 GHz (16 logical cores) processors.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Atlassian has a recommended sizing guide. Refer to the following URL for more information: <a class="ulink" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/jira-sizing-guide-461504623.html">https://confluence.atlassian.com/enterprise/jira-sizing-guide-461504623.html</a>.</li></ul></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Will you need mail notifications in JIRA?</strong>: Do you want e-mail notifications sent to users? JIRA has the capability to send e-mails to users on various events, such as issue creating, updating, and resolving. In order to send e-mails, an SMTP server is required. JIRA can also be configured with Google Apps for Work; just enter your username and password to enable notifications. It's also possible to create issues and post comments using a dedicated e-mail. This functionality can be configured using e-mail handlers in JIRA so that users won't need to launch JIRA to post a comment on the ticket they are assigned to; they can just reply to the e-mail received from JIRA.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Authentication</strong>: JIRA has its own internal directory user management system where the information of a user is stored in an internal database. By default, it's enabled when you install JIRA. It's also possible to use directory servers such as LDAP for authentication, user, and group management. In huge organizations where a lot of tools are used, it's important to have such integrated authentication mechanisms so that end users don't have to remember multiple passwords.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Can JIRA be used from multiple locations?</strong>: It's important to know the geographical location of the user and from where they will be accessing the JIRA instance. The choice of a JIRA server becomes important here; latency checks should be done from all such locations and the server location should be in such a way that it offers the best performance to everyone accessing it. As a JIRA administrator, your responsibility will be to do performance routine maintenance activities, such as indexing in JIRA. You should know the time window when there are a less number of users connected to the system.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>How many concurrent users will access the system?</strong>:<strong> </strong>If you have thousands of users in a geographical location, they may access the system simultaneously. This will result in a degraded performance. Although it's important to know the peak usage during the day beforehand, there are various performance improvement measures that can be worked on.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Tentatively, how many issues per project can be stored?</strong>: Discuss with all the product stakeholders about the usage of the tool. You should have plenty of storage to accommodate the huge amount of data. Of course, as an administrator, you will have a fair understanding of the usage. A project can have thousands of issues and these can have file attachments. From time to time, keep a check on the free disk space.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Tentatively, how many total issues can be stored?</strong>:<strong> </strong>JIRA indexing helps in improved search results. However, it can take several minutes to finish and it should ideally be done when there is less usage of the tool. A JIRA instance with less than 100,000 issues may take 10-15 minutes to finish and you should keep this in mind before announcing a downtime. Knowing how many issues will be present in the system will help you to make better decisions.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Will users also upload attachments in their projects?</strong>: The out-of-the-box concept of JIRA has a provision to attach files along with issues. Of course, it's a desirable feature and everyone wants this. All the attachments are stored on the disk. Maybe, for some good reason, there is no need to have this feature and it's always good to discuss this first with the product stakeholders.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>How many custom fields do you intend to create?</strong>: Ideally, all the schemes and configurations should be documented before implementing it, but it's always good to have a clear understanding of the number of custom fields that you need to create in the system.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Choice of platform and database</strong>: JIRA (being a pure Java-based application) can be installed either on the Windows or Linux operating system. It needs a JDK or JRE environment to run. If your IT team is more comfortable with Windows and SQL, then use it. Linux has some advantages (such as SSH) and is more suitable for open source tools (such as Postgres or MySQL).</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Integration with other tools</strong>: JIRA can be integrated into a lot of other tools from Atlassian and other commonly used tools in software development. Will you need integration with Confluence, FishEye/Crucible, Bamboo, Git, or SVN? Keep these possible integrations in mind at the beginning.<p>Generally, for best performance, most people prefer Linux-RedHat or CentOS as the first choice of distribution. The preferred database is MySQL and Postgres.</p></li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip3"/>Tip</h3><p>For further information on supported platforms, visit the following documentation on Atlassian at <a class="ulink" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Supported+Platforms">https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Supported+Platforms</a>.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec11"/>Installation of JIRA on Windows</h2></div></div></div><p>JIRA can be easily installed using the automated Windows Installer.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec10"/>Setting up the MySQL database</h1></div></div></div><p>JIRA needs to store its data in a database. For this, we will set up a MySQL database. JIRA 7 requires MySQL 5.1 up until 5.6 to run smoothly. You should refer to the preferred MySQL server configurations as described on the following page: <a class="ulink" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/connecting-jira-to-mysql-185729489.html">https://confluence.atlassian.com/jira/connecting-jira-to-mysql-185729489.html</a>.</p><p>It's also possible to use PostgreSQL, Oracle, or Microsoft SQL Server with JIRA, but here we will discuss how to set up the MySQL database:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Log in to your MySQL Server with the following command:<pre class="programlisting">

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec14"/>Updating JIRA add-ons</h1></div></div></div><p>JIRA has a lot of add-ons that can be installed from the marketplace. Add-ons extend the functionalities of JIRA. There are a lot of good add-ons available from Atlassian and other providers. Due to the rapid development in JIRA, this could be a new feature development. To fix bugs, these providers keep on releasing version updates of their add-ons. It's a good idea to update these add-ons from time to time. However, it's recommended to test the upgrades first on your staging environment.</p><p>Go to the <strong>Manage Add-ons</strong> section to check for the updates that are available for your add-ons. The built-in notifications in JIRA will also let you know whenever there is an update available for an add-on. However, these updates should ideally be performed on a test environment first, that is, ideally a staging server identical to your production environment.</p><p>Only if the new version of the add-on works on your staging environment will you be able to update it on your production environment. Try using one of the following methods to update the add-ons described:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Updating an add-on to a new version</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Updating all add-ons</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Updating an add-on by uploading a file</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Enabling automatic add-on updates</li></ul></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip12"/>Tip</h3><p>The detailed steps to update the add-ons can be found at <a class="ulink" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Updating+add-ons">https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/UPM/Updating+add-ons</a>.</p></div></div><p>We recommend updating the add-ons one by one. There might be an issue in updating all the add-ons simultaneously. Also, you might not know which add-on update caused this problem.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl2sec21"/>The JIRA add-ons compatibility matrix</h2></div></div></div><p>As a good practice, always keep track of all the add-ons currently installed, their current version, their compatibility with currently installed JIRA, and any known issues.</p><p>Before you plan to update any add-on, always update the compatibility matrix:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Project Categories</strong>: When there are too many projects in JIRA, it becomes important to segregate them into various categories. JIRA will let you create several categories that could represent the business units, clients, or teams in your company.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Projects</strong>: A JIRA project is a collection of issues. Your team can use a JIRA project to coordinate the development of a product, track a project, manage a help desk, and so on, depending on your requirements.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Components</strong>: Components are subsections of a project. They are used to group issues within a project to smaller parts.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Versions</strong>: Versions are a point-in-time for a project. They help you schedule and organize your releases.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Issue Types</strong>: JIRA will let you create several issue types that are different from each other in terms of what kind of information they store. JIRA comes with default issue types, such as bug, task, and subtask, but you can create more issue types that can follow their own workflow as well as have different sets of fields.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Sub-Tasks</strong>: Issue types are of two types—standard and subtasks, which are children of a standard task. For instance, you can have test campaign as a standard issue type and test cases as subtasks.</li></ul></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch01lvl1sec17"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we discussed things that you plan before implementing JIRA in your company, understood how JIRA is intended to be used in the future, and how it helps JIRA administrators to choose the right hardware. We also discussed the JIRA installation in detail and various ways to upgrade it. Finally, we briefly discussed some possible use cases of JIRA.</p><p>In the next chapter, we will understand how to search the issues. JIRA comes with a powerful search mechanism that helps users to easily find the information they are looking for. JIRA has a query language called <strong>JIRA Query Language</strong> (<strong>JQL</strong>), which is used for advanced searching. We will also discuss how to save your search queries as filters, which can be referred to again in the future.</p></div></body></html>
