<p>The following is one of the high-profile adoptions of the ERP system (SAP) for the DevOps process at each stage of its cycle:</p>

<p>As we can see from the preceding process, on mature DevOps adoption, replacing even the traditional SAP life cycle manager for the following activities involves:</p>
<ul>
<li>Eclipse i<span>ntegrated development environment (</span>IDE)-based l<span>ocal development</span></li>
<li>Git/Gerrit is used for code repository</li>
<li>Nexus is used for artifact repository</li>
<li>Jenkins for <span>Release Build Server for continuous integration and deployment</span></li>
<li>SAP Cloud platform is adopted for production deployments</li>
</ul>
<p>Users benefit from the agility and customization of features by adopting the open source tools and DevOps process. The procurement and maintenance costs of the SAP life cycle manager are saved for the organizations.</p>
