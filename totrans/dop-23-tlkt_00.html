<p>If you read one of the other books in <em>The DevOps Toolkit Series</em> (<a href="http://www.devopstoolkitseries.com/" target="_blank">http://www.devopstoolkitseries.com/</a>), you already know that I am a huge fan of containers, schedulers, and orchestrators. <em>The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit: Automating the Continuous Deployment Pipeline with Containerized Microservices</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M">https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M</a>) started as an overview of many different DevOps tools and practices, with containers having an important, but not a decisive role. In the meantime, I fell in utter and complete love with Docker and Swarm, so I chose to write <em>The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit: Docker Swarm: Building, testing, deploying, and monitoring services inside Docker Swarm clusters</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914" target="_blank">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1542468914</a>). By the time I finished it, I felt that some advanced topics were not explored and deserve a book on its own. <em>The DevOps 2.2 Toolkit: Self-Sufficient Docker Clusters: Building Self-Adaptive And Self-Healing Docker Clusters</em> (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1979347190">https://www.amazon.com/dp/1979347190</a>) was born.</p>
<p>All those books were (directly or indirectly) focused on Docker Swarm, and I felt that Kubernetes deserves its own space. Truth be told, I was negative about it a few years ago. It was too complicated for most use cases. It was enough to try installing it and, after days of struggle, give up. However, Kubernetes has come a long way since then. Even though its founding principles are the same, with time, it became more mature, more straightforward, and much bigger. Today, it is the biggest and the most adopted container orchestration platform. Some of the most prominent software companies rallied around it. Many startups emerged with new solutions. The open source community behind Kubernetes is one of the biggest in the history of software development. The community is vibrant, fast moving, and with a lot of vested interest in seeing Kubernetes succeed. Even Docker chose to support it and join the community. Kubernetes has a bright future ahead, and no one should ignore it.</p>
<p>If you already chose a different container scheduler (for example, Docker Swarm, Mesos, Nomad, or something else), you might wonder whether it makes sense for you to invest time learning Kubernetes. I think it does. We should always be on a lookout for different solutions. Otherwise, we’re being forced to choose one blindly. No matter whether you decide to adopt Kubernetes or to stick with something else, I’ll argue that you should know how it works and what it offers. It’s all about making an educated decision.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Overview</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The goal of this book is not to convince you to adopt Kubernetes but to provide a detailed overview of its features. I want you to become confident in your Kubernetes knowledge and only then choose whether to embrace it. That is, unless you already made up your mind and stumbled upon this book in search of Kubernetes guidance.</p>
<p>The plan is to cover all aspects behind Kubernetes, from basic to advanced features. We’ll go not only through the tools behind the official project but also third-party add-ons. I hope that, by the time you finish reading this book, you will be able to call yourself “Kubernetes ninja”. I cannot say that you will know everything there is to know about the Kubernetes ecosystem. That would be impossible to accomplish since its growing faster than any single person could follow. What I can say is that you will be very confident in running a Kubernetes cluster of any scale in production.</p>
<p>Like all my other books, this one is very hands-on. There will be just enough theory for you to understand the principles behind each topic. The book is packed with examples, so I need to give you a heads up. Do not buy this book if you’re planning to read it on a bus or in bed before going to sleep. You will need to be in front of your computer. A terminal will be your best friend. <kbd>kubectl</kbd> will be your lover.</p>
<p>The book assumes that you feel comfortable with containers, especially Docker. We won’t go into details how to build an image, what is container registry, and how to write Dockerfile. I hope you already know all that. If that’s not the case, you might want to postpone reading this and learn at least basic container operations. This book is about things that happen after you built your images and stored them in a registry.</p>
<p>This book is about running containers at scale and not panicking when problems arise. It is about the present and the future of software deployment and monitoring. It’s about embracing the challenges and staying ahead of the curve.</p>
<p>Eventually, you might get stuck and will be in need of help. Or you might want to write a review or comment on the book’s content. Please join the DevOps20 (<a href="http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/" target="_blank">http://slack.devops20toolkit.com/</a>) Slack channel and post your thoughts, ask questions, or participate in a discussion. If you prefer a more one-on-one communication, you can use Slack to send me a private message or send an email to <kbd>viktor@farcic.com</kbd>. All the books I wrote are very dear to me, and I want you to have a good experience reading them. Part of that experience is the option to reach out to me. Don’t be shy.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Please note that this one, just as the previous books, is self-published. I believe that having no intermediaries between the writer and the reader is the best way to go.  It allows me to write faster, update the book more frequently, and have a more direct communication with you. Your feedback is part of the process. No matter whether you purchased the book while only a few or all chapters were written, the idea is that it will never be truly finished. As time passes, it will require updates so that it is aligned with the change in technology or processes. When possible, I will try to keep it up to date and release updates whenever that makes sense. Eventually, things might change so much that updates are not a good option anymore, and that will be a sign that a whole new book is required. I will keep writing as long as I continue getting your support<strong>.</strong></p>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "E<span>ven though we executed the </span><kbd>docker</kbd><span> command inside a container, the output clearly shows the images from the host.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>global: 
  scrape_interval:     15s 
 
scrape_configs: 
  - job_name: Prometheus 
    metrics_path: /prometheus/metrics 
    static_configs: 
      - targets: 
        - localhost:9090 </pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>global: 
  scrape_interval:     15s 
 
scrape_configs: 
  <strong>- job_name: Prometheus</strong> 
    metrics_path: /prometheus/metrics 
    static_configs: 
      - targets: 
        - localhost:9090 </pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><span><strong>docker container exec -it $ID \</strong><br/><strong>    curl node-exporter:9100/metrics</strong><br/></span></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "Please type <kbd>test</kbd> in the <span class="packt_screen">item name</span> field, select <kbd>Pipeline</kbd> as the <span class="packt_screen">type</span>, and click the <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> button.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
