- en: Over the years, Jira has grown from a simple bug-tracking system designed for
    engineers to manage their projects to an all-purpose issue-tracking solution.
    The term Jira now refers to a suite of products, including Jira Software, Jira
    Service Management, Jira Core, and others. With this change, each product is more
    focused on what it does and the value it provides. It is now easier than ever
    for customers to choose the product best suited to their needs, whether they are
    running an Agile software development project, a customer support portal, or simply
    a generic task management system.
