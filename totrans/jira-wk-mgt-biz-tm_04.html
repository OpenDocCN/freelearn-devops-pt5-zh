		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-48"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor047"/>Chapter 3</em>: Creating Your First Project</h1>
			<p>Now that we have a lot of the preliminaries out of the way, let's get down to some real work. As you might have already guessed, the first step will be to create a project. We will walk through an example using the project management template, as it is the one that is most widely used.</p>
			<p>This will begin our hands-on experience with the tool and we will follow the same process, in terms of how objects are created, as we progress from chapter to chapter. We will follow that up by creating our first issues and discovering how they are displayed on the board. Then, we will take a look at some of the administrative aspects of the tool that are automatically created when you build a project.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The process of creating a new project</li>
				<li>What's next after creating a project?</li>
				<li>The administration components of Jira Work Management projects</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have created your first Jira Work Management project and seen some initial issues. Additionally, you will be able to interact with the various administrative functions that are associated with the project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-49"><a id="_idTextAnchor048"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As Jira Work Management is only available in the Jira Cloud environment, the requirement for this chapter is simple: <em class="italic">access to a Jira Cloud environment</em>.</p>
			<p>If you already have access to Jira Cloud, that is great – you are ready to go! If not, Atlassian provides a free Jira Work Management account for up to 10 users. You can create your account by navigating to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free">https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free</a> and following the instructions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-50"><a id="_idTextAnchor049"/>Let's create a project!</h1>
			<p>We will <a id="_idIndexMarker115"/>begin by selecting the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> option in the top navigation bar and then selecting <strong class="bold">Create project</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.1_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.1 – The creating a project menu option&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.1 – The creating a project menu option</p>
			<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>previously discussed in <a href="B17952_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Project Templates</em>, there will immediately be a list of project templates displayed for Jira Work Management. At the time of writing, there are approximately 20 templates available. <em class="italic">Figure 3.2</em> shows just a subset of what is available:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.2_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.2 – Project template selection&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.2 – Project template selection</p>
			<p>For our first<a id="_idIndexMarker117"/> project, we will click on the first option, that is, <strong class="bold">Project management</strong>. Next, we will view the template details for our selection:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.3_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.3 – Project management template details&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.3 – Project management template details</p>
			<p>There is <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>a lot of information available on this details page, including the issue types used by the project and the steps in the workflow. Additionally, there are some general descriptions regarding how the template applies to the work you are doing, the components that will be available for the project (such as a list, calendar, or board), and how it aids with collaboration. This is intended to be more of a guide to ensure it is the right project template that you wish to create.</p>
			<p>After your review, simply click on the <strong class="bold">Use template</strong> button. That will bring you to <em class="italic">Figure 3.4</em>, where you will give your project a name:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.4_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.4 – Naming the project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.4 – Naming the project</p>
			<p>Initially, when this window is displayed, each of the fields will be empty. I have added some text as an example of the type of information that can be entered. Here's a rundown of each field:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker119"/>name of the project is your choosing. This value can easily be updated at any time if you change your mind. You should not spend too much time trying to create the perfect name right now – your priority is to get the project created. For our test project, I have chosen to create one based on recurring company staff meeting presentations.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key</strong>: The key is a<a id="_idIndexMarker120"/> short descriptor for the project and will probably be the most known part of an issue's ID. The key is required to be at least two characters in length, no more than 10 characters, and must start with a letter. All values for the key will be in uppercase by default, so do take that into consideration when creating the value. Changing the value of the key after it has been created can cause potential disconnects or other problems, so be careful when assigning.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Template</strong>: This is just a <a id="_idIndexMarker121"/>final check that this is the template you want to use. You still have the option to change it at this point by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Change template</strong> button.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">What team is this for?</strong>: This is used by the internal Atlassian Jira Work Management product team to get a good feel for the types of teams using JWM projects. You will not be able<a id="_idIndexMarker122"/> to use the value in any other place in Jira. This field is optional.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>For your first project, feel free to use whatever name and key you would like.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Only project administrators or Jira administrators will be able to create new projects if you are not also subscribed to Jira Software or Jira Service Management. If you have either of those in addition to JWM, you must be a Jira administrator to create a project.</p>
			<p class="callout">Additionally, the project key will not be reusable for other projects in the future unless the entire original project using that key has been deleted.</p>
			<p>Finally, click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button to finish the new setup of your project. That's it! Your first project has been created! Let's take a closer look at what it produces.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-51"><a id="_idTextAnchor050"/>The project board</h2>
			<p>When the project creation <a id="_idIndexMarker123"/>process is complete, you most likely will be directed to the project board. Notice, in the menu on the left-hand side, that you can easily navigate back to the board at any time by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Board</strong> option.</p>
			<p>The board will initially be created with columns that match the statuses of the workflow. Please refer back to the project template details in <em class="italic">Figure 3.3</em>, which shows the statuses that have been created in the workflow – in this case, <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong>, <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong>, and <strong class="bold">DONE</strong>.</p>
			<p>We will go into more depth about <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>how the board operates and how to make changes in <a href="B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.5_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.5 – The project board&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.5 – The project board</p>
			<p>We have explored the basics of project creation and gotten familiar with some of the tools. Where do we go from here?</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor051"/>The project has been created – now what?</h2>
			<p>Now that the project has processed and created the initial toolset based on the template used, what should our next steps be? While still on the board, there is a button available with a light bulb icon and the word <strong class="bold">Quickstart</strong>. Let's explore it by clicking on the button.</p>
			<p>Doing so will display a popup on the right-hand side, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.6</em>. The purpose of the quickstart window<a id="_idIndexMarker125"/> is to offer more information and guidance about each of the components available with a Jira Work Management project. As you explore each of these components, they will be checked off to give you visibility as to which items you have reviewed.</p>
			<p>The downward-pointing caret will open additional information about the component. You can then click on the <strong class="bold">Guide me</strong> button to receive more in-depth information about the tool. We will explore each <a id="_idIndexMarker126"/>component, in additional detail, in <em class="italic">Chapters 5</em>, <em class="italic">JWM Toolset – Summary, Lists, Timelines, and the Calendar</em>, and <a href="B17952_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Forms, Dashboards, and Reports</em>. To collapse the detailed information, just click on the upward-pointing arrow for that section:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.6_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.6 – Quickstart&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.6 – Quickstart</p>
			<p>The quickstart button<a id="_idIndexMarker127"/> will be available on the board until you click on the <strong class="bold">Dismiss Quickstart</strong> option at the bottom of the popup. If you simply want to close the popup for the time being but still have it available, click on the two arrows to minimize the window in the upper-right corner of the popup. However, even when you have dismissed the quickstart option, you can still get it back. Simply click on your avatar in the upper-right corner of the top navigation bar and select <strong class="bold">Open Quickstart</strong>.</p>
			<p>In the next few sections, we will explore the various ways in which to create an issue/work item and see how it is displayed on the board.</p>
			<h3>Creating your first issue</h3>
			<p>There are at least three different places where you can begin creating your first issue. This is also a good time to discuss some terminology. Within the Jira product family, the term used to represent a piece of work to be done is <strong class="bold">Issue</strong>.</p>
			<p>However, note that there are<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> other words that you will come across that carry out the same work. In <em class="italic">Figure 3.5</em>, you can see the word <strong class="bold">Item</strong> in the bottom-center box. Once the issue/item has been created and appears on the board, it is often referred to as a <strong class="bold">Card</strong>. Regardless of which term<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> is used, please understand that they all refer to the same piece of work. However, for clarity, we will refer to it as an issue, as the standard term for the remainder of this book.</p>
			<p>Additionally, just as you can refer to the work in different ways, there is no one preferred method to create an issue. We will walk through each option as follows: options 1 and 2 are the most basic, while option 3 provides the opportunity to enter the most information. Later, in <a href="B17952_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Forms, Issues, Dashboards, and Reports</em>, we will learn how to use forms to create an issue.</p>
			<h4>Creating option 1</h4>
			<p>Let's begin with the first creation method. As observed under the <strong class="bold">Visualize your work with a board</strong> section in <em class="italic">Figure 3.5</em>, there is a button at the bottom of the screen for <strong class="bold">Create your first item</strong>. When you click on that button, you will see something similar to <em class="italic">Figure 3.7</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.7_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.7 – Creating an issue&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.7 – Creating an issue</p>
			<p>Clicking on the button will open a<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> textbox in the first column on the board and will display a <strong class="bold">Start typing…</strong> phrase. It is really that simple – you just type a very short description of the work to be done and click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.8_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.8 – Issue creation directly on board&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.8 – Issue creation directly on board</p>
			<p>Now let's look at another function to create issues.</p>
			<h4>Creating option 2</h4>
			<p>Alternatively, you<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> can create a new item of work by clicking on the <strong class="bold">+ Create new issue</strong> button at the bottom of the first column (<strong class="bold">TO DO</strong>) on the board. This will display the same view as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.5</em>, where you can begin typing the name of your first issue. Both options will bring you to the same spot on the card.</p>
			<h4>Creating option 3</h4>
			<p>Finally, you can create an<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> issue by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button in the top navigation bar:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.9_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.9 – Create an issue via the top navigation bar&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.9 – Create an issue via the top navigation bar</p>
			<p>Clicking on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button will display the <strong class="bold">issue Create</strong> screen for this project. As we discovered in the first two options for creating a new issue, the user is only able to type in the name of the issue. Informally, this is also known as the card title or issue name. However, more formally, it is referred to, in Jira, as the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong>.</p>
			<p>Options 1 and 2 are<a id="_idIndexMarker133"/> intended to be very quick methods of creating a new issue or card. The issue will use the default issue type for the project (that is, the issue type at the top of the list of issue types in the issue type scheme. Please refer to <a href="B17952_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring Permissions and Simple Administration</em>, for details regarding how to change the default issue type).</p>
			<p>As you can see, in <em class="italic">Figure 3.10</em>, using the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button in the top navigation bar will provide the user with the most flexibility when creating a new issue. One advantage to this option is that you can use a different issue type other than the default. Another advantage is that you can insert information into additional fields at the same time you create the issue. Please refer to <a href="B17952_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Fields, Screens, and Issue Layouts</em>, for more information on how to control the fields used by the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.10_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.10 – Creating a screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.10 – Creating a screen</p>
			<p>This is a great time to add values for <a id="_idIndexMarker134"/>fields such as the due date, priority, description, and more. The <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> field will appear in the card view on the board (as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.12</em>) as well as be visible in the calendar view. The start date will be used to properly visualize the work on the timeline view.</p>
			<p>Of course, you can always update the details of the card later, even if you are using one of the quick methods for creating a new issue.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Back to the board</h2>
			<p>With Jira Software projects, the <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>board is the primary way for users to interact with the issues that have been created. While Jira Work Management gives you new components to view and work with issues, the board remains a key visual method for viewing your work.</p>
			<p>Let's take a look at some functions of the board. To move a card to the next step in the workflow (for instance, to the next column or any other available column), simply click on the card and drag it to the desired available column.</p>
			<p>As you can see in the following screenshot, the card can go to two different columns – either the <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> column or the <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> column, as noted by the columns being highlighted with different colors. It is confusing sometimes as to which status the card will settle into when released, particularly if the card is straddling both columns. All the available columns/statuses will be highlighted in a light shade of blue (as indicated by the <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> column in the following screenshot). However, one column/status will be highlighted a light shade of green. When the mouse is released, the card will fall into the status with the light green color (as indicated by the <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> column in the following screenshot):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.11_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.11 – Moving a card&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.11 – Moving a card</p>
			<p>Additional information will also be displayed on the card while on the board if those fields are populated. By default, the <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> option will appear on the card. You can view this in <em class="italic">Figure 3.12</em> represented by the January dates. If the field has not been populated, there will simply be no value displayed – as shown in the card in <em class="italic">Figure 3.11</em>.</p>
			<p>Also, by default, the card will be assigned to the user who pulls the card into a new status or column. In the following example, we see that no cards are assigned in the first column (<strong class="bold">TO DO</strong>). However, we see an avatar for the user assigned to the cards in both the middle and last columns. If the user does not have an avatar linked to their profile, or for security reasons is not <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>making their image available, the user's initials will be displayed:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.12_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.12 – Multiple cards on a board&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.12 – Multiple cards on a board</p>
			<p>We have now created issues/cards and seen how they appear on boards. At this point we can create and use projects to accomplish our work. Next, let's look at how we can tweak the administration to get more flexibility and function.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Accessing the Jira Work Management Administration components</h1>
			<p>Although we will go into the administration details more fully <a href="B17952_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Fields, Screens, and Issue Layouts</em>, and <a href="B17952_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring Permissions and Simple Administration</em>, at this point, it is helpful to be able to find simple administration information. However, to do that, you need to know where to look and what to look for.</p>
			<p>To gain access to <a id="_idIndexMarker137"/>administrative tools and information, you must be a project administrator. This means that the user must have an administrator project role and that role should be linked to the administer projects permission in the permission scheme attached to the project. We will discuss this in more detail in <a href="B17952_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring Permissions and Simple Administration</em>. As a side note, just because the user is a Jira administrator or <em class="italic">system</em> administrator, that does not automatically give the user access to administer projects.</p>
			<p>Click on the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> option on the left-hand side menu to enter the project administration area. If you do not see the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> option, then you do not have project administrator permissions:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.13_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.13 – Project settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.13 – Project settings</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Project details</h2>
			<p>Selecting <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> will advance you to the <a id="_idIndexMarker138"/>project details window, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.15</em>. This is where you can change a variety of settings for the project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.14_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.14 – Project details&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.14 – Project details</p>
			<p>The following options are available:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: This is<a id="_idIndexMarker139"/> the location where you<a id="_idIndexMarker140"/> can change the name of the project that was populated during the project creation process. You can change the name at any time. It is a required field.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key</strong>: As with the <a id="_idIndexMarker141"/>name, this is where the key can be changed. Again, you should use caution when changing it. It is a required field.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">URL</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> provides a link to a user-provided external site that contains more details about the project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project Type</strong>: This is used to<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> set to a value of <strong class="bold">Business</strong> for Jira Work Management projects and cannot be changed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project Category</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker144"/> field will be blank for your first project as no project categories exist. You need to click on the information icon to create your first category. After at least one category has been created, you can add the value to the <strong class="bold">Project Category</strong> field.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Avatar</strong>: There is a built-in <a id="_idIndexMarker145"/>set of images available for all projects. An initial avatar will be randomly defaulted to for your project when it is created. You can click on the <strong class="bold">select image</strong> link to change the avatar. On the ensuing screen, you can also upload a custom image from your computer. It is a required field.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: The description<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> provides users in our Jira instance with more information about the project. This field is optional.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project Lead</strong>: This is associated with the project lead<a id="_idIndexMarker147"/> role within the project. Typically, it refers to the main project administrator. This role can be used for additional permissions and notifications within the system. It is a required field.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Default Assignee</strong>: All new<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> issues created will be assigned to the default assignee if the field is populated. The only valid values are <strong class="bold">Unassigned</strong> or <strong class="bold">Project Lead</strong>. Individual<a id="_idIndexMarker149"/> users cannot be submitted for the field. If you want someone other than the project lead to be automatically assigned to new issues, you will need to change the value for the project lead.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can change the values of the project's details at any time. After the changes are made, make sure that you click the <strong class="bold">Save details</strong> button.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>People</h2>
			<p>For security reasons, you<a id="_idIndexMarker150"/> can change who has access to the project and what permissions they have by clicking on the <strong class="bold">People</strong> option on the left-hand menu, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.15</em>. For instance, with the free subscription, all users automatically have access to all projects and are project administrators. For paid subscriptions, you can add multiple roles and users:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.15_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.15 – Assigning access&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.15 – Assigning access</p>
			<p>For these paid <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>subscription instances, the user should click on the <strong class="bold">Add people</strong> button in the upper-right corner. From there, you will be able to add users to the project and assign them to project roles.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Issue types</h2>
			<p>As <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>demonstrated in the project template details, Jira Work Management projects are created with a predefined set of <strong class="bold">issue types</strong>. As we navigate to the issue types scheme, we can observe those issue types displayed in <em class="italic">Figure 3.16</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.16_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.16 – Issue types&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.16 – Issue types</p>
			<p>You can make <a id="_idIndexMarker153"/>changes to the list of issue types available for the project by clicking the <strong class="bold">Issue types</strong> option from the left-hand side menu. We will discuss this function in more detail in <a href="B17952_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring Permissions and Simple Administration</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Screen and issue layout</h2>
			<p>The options to create, view, and edit <strong class="bold">Screens</strong> are<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> available to enable users to control fields for issues on a project. They are a fascinating function in Jira with lots of caveats and complexities. They are the most common and effective way to view lots of information about a single issue in one place. Prior to the helpful inclusion of inline editable lists in Jira Work Management projects, screens were the only real way to update issues in Jira.</p>
			<p>We will discuss how to create new custom fields in <a href="B17952_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Fields, Screens, and Issue Layouts</em>. However, if you would like to change the order of fields on a screen, you can do so in the following manner:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Issue layout</strong> from the menu on the left-hand side. It will display a screen that is similar to <em class="italic">Figure 3.17</em>.</li>
				<li>Select the link for one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker155"/>screens in the middle of the display. In our preceding example, we have a single screen available for all the edit, view, and create functions:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.17_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.17 – Issue screens&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.17 – Issue screens</p>
			<p>The preceding <strong class="bold">Issue layout</strong> screen will <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>actually show multiple screens by issue type if different screens have been created for different issue types.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">We will discuss how to create separate screens for the edit, view, and create functions in <a href="B17952_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring Permissions and Simple Administration</em>. Part of that discussion will be that you can have multiple screens per issue type. In other words, you can have a screen with certain fields on it for the <strong class="bold">Task</strong> issue type and a different screen with different fields for the <strong class="bold">Sub-task</strong> issue type. If that is the case, you will be able to observe separate rows for the screens and the issue type they are associated with on the view, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.17.</em></p>
			<p>Again, to edit the screen, simply<a id="_idIndexMarker157"/> click on the link for the screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.18_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.18 – Configuring the screen&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.18 – Configuring the screen</p>
			<p>At this point, the <a id="_idIndexMarker158"/>user can add existing fields to a screen or rearrange the order of the fields on the screen. This applies at an overall level for the screen, meaning that it will apply to all projects and issues that use this screen. When fields are added or rearranged, the screen is immediately saved.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can make changes to the screen layout that only affect the project. While on the <strong class="bold">Issue layout</strong> screen, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 3.17</em>, the user can select the issue layout link on the<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> right-hand side of the issue types listing.</p>
			<p>The issue layout functionality provides a mechanism to override the order and placement of fields for the attached screen, but just for this project. Remember how we mentioned any changes to the actual screen will be organization-wide? However, here, we can rearrange things a bit for just our project. Changing the order and placement of the fields here will not change the order of the fields on the screen for any other project:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.19_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.19 – Issue layout&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.19 – Issue layout</p>
			<p>There are three major sections to the layout: <strong class="bold">Description fields</strong>, <strong class="bold">Context fields</strong>, and <strong class="bold">HIDE WHEN EMPTY</strong>. Fields can be dragged easily from one section to another, as desired, for better viewing. It should be noted that the changes applied to the issue layout will apply to all the user's views of the screen for that project. And again, this change can only be made by a project administrator.</p>
			<p>Sometimes, there are fields present on the screen that are associated with the combination of project and issue type but are no longer desired to be seen. You can remove the fields from being visible for just this project by dragging the fields to the far-right section labeled <strong class="bold">Hidden fields</strong>. This can either be a temporary solution or a more permanent solution. Note that any changes you make to the issue layout must be saved by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Save changes</strong> button at the bottom of the screen.</p>
			<p>When a new project is<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> created, the default placement for fields in the issue layout is that paragraph or multiline fields will land in the <strong class="bold">Description fields</strong> section, while most other fields will be placed in the <strong class="bold">Context fields</strong> section. Finally, some system-level fields will be designated to the <strong class="bold">HIDE WHEN EMPTY</strong> section. These are hidden when empty fields include the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Labels</li>
				<li>Original estimate</li>
				<li>Time tracking</li>
				<li>Components</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If no separate view screen has been created, all the fields will be considered to be in <em class="italic">edit mode</em> when you enter the screen. Field values can be changed directly by entering values in the field. Less commonly used fields can be dragged to the bottom <strong class="bold">HIDE WHEN EMPTY</strong> section to not take up real estate on the screen. To access these fields while on the screen, click on the <strong class="bold">More fields</strong> drop-down menu in the bottom-right corner to display the fields:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.20_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.20 – More fields&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.20 – More fields</p>
			<p>Often, we would like to apply this new issue layout for multiple projects. This could be for only some projects or perhaps even all projects. Making all the changes for several projects would be very cumbersome and frustrating. However, the issue layout feature has gone through several enhancements in the past few years that address that concern.</p>
			<p>One of the best of <a id="_idIndexMarker161"/>these improvements is the ability to copy the issue layout and apply the layout to other projects. While this is still not ideal, it provides for a great interim step on the way to the issue layout functionality being implemented more like schemes in the future.</p>
			<p>For now, simply click on the <strong class="bold">Copy issue layout</strong> button in the upper-right corner of the screen and then follow the prompts. It should be noted that you can only copy the layout to other projects that use the same screen.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Schemes</h2>
			<p>The concept of<a id="_idIndexMarker162"/> schemes is one of the most powerful features<a id="_idIndexMarker163"/> in Jira. It provides increased functionality and flexibility. However, it also brings increased complexity and frustration for new administrators. We will discuss this more fully in <a href="B17952_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring Permissions and Simple Administration</em>, but some mention of it needs to take place here.</p>
			<p>You can think of a scheme as a bucket holding multiple items. So, a screen scheme can hold multiple screens in it – each performing different functions, such as edit, create, or view. A workflow scheme can hold multiple workflows – each associated with a different issue type and providing for varied paths across the board for each type.</p>
			<p>Finally, it is the scheme that is attached to the project and not the individual items in the bucket. The bucket is attached to the project and, therefore, all the contents within the bucket apply to the project.</p>
			<h3>Workflows</h3>
			<p>Normally, workflows<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> are a great example of the scheme concept. However, with Jira Work Management projects, only one workflow is allowed to be attached to the project for the built-in board to work. JWM projects still follow the scheme approach, even though only one workflow will probably be contained within the scheme bucket.</p>
			<p>For the project administrator to view and/or make changes to the workflow for the Jira Work Management project, we begin by selecting the <strong class="bold">Workflows</strong> option from the left-hand side menu:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.21_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.21 – Workflow scheme&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.21 – Workflow scheme</p>
			<p>The resulting<a id="_idIndexMarker165"/> page shows the contents of the bucket. In this case, the single project management workflow for the project. To edit the workflow, click on the pencil icon (<strong class="bold">Edit</strong>) on the far-right side. This leads us to the actual workflow. If the view of the workflow lands on the <strong class="bold">Text</strong> display of the workflow, it is best to click on the <strong class="bold">Diagram</strong> button to observe it in a visual rendering:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_3.22_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 3.22 – Workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 3.22 – Workflow</p>
			<p>We will discover how to modify the workflow, and therefore the board, in <a href="B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>New terms learned in this chapter</h1>
			<p>Let's conclude this chapter by going through the list of new terms we have learned:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key</strong>: This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker166"/>unique code to identify an issue or project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quickstart</strong>: This is a <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>guide within Jira Work Management that contains more in-depth information about the project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue</strong>: This is the<a id="_idIndexMarker168"/> Jira term for a unit of work to be done. It is also known as a card or a ticket.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project settings</strong>: This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>administration section that controls the functions of a project. You must be a project administrator to access this section of the project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Screens</strong>: This is the <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>most used interface between a user and the information related to the work being performed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue layout</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>the administrative function of a project, which controls the order and sections of a screen in which the fields appear.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Schemes</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>a collection of components used to administer various functions of a project. Schemes can be shared across projects.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Congratulations! You have now created your first Jira Work Management project. Hopefully, you have also discovered a few new issues/cards to go along with it.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned how easy it is to follow the template process to create a Jira Work Management project. We answered the question of what's next after project creation with our equally simple trip down the project settings path to the world of JWM project administration.</p>
			<p>Armed with this new ability, you can now feel confident about accessing simple administration components that will give you more insight into your project and the work you are performing.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will jump into the details of how to modify the board and underlying workflow, how to create new boards, and how to interact with various schemes to give us real power over our Jira Work Management projects.</p>
