These reports help management take wise decisions at the right time. JIRA offers a lot of built-in project reports, which will be explained in this chapter. Dashboards will also be explained here to help you understand how you can share project statistics with other users.</p><p>The topics covered in this chapter are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Project reports</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Configuring and sharing dashboards</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Gadgets for reporting purposes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using add-on charts to visualize data</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec26"/>Project reports</h1></div></div></div><p>Once you start using JIRA to track issues of any type, it becomes imperative to derive useful information from it. JIRA comes with built-in reports that show real-time statistics for projects, users, and other fields. At the time of running the project, reports will always display the most up-to-date information.</p><p>Let's take a look at each of these reports.</p><p>Open any project in JIRA that contains a lot of issues and has around 5 to 10 users, which are either assignees or reporters. When you open any project page, the default view is the summary view, which contains an <strong>Activity Stream</strong> that shows whatever is happening in the project, such as the creation of new issues, status updates, comments, and, basically, any change in the project.</p><p>On the left-hand side of the project summary page, there is a link for <strong>Reports</strong> under the project navigation sidebar. All the project-related reports can be found here.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec29"/>Issues</h2></div></div></div><p>When the <strong>Summary</strong> page is open, click on the <strong>Switch view</strong> drop-down list right next to <strong>Activity</strong> and select <strong>Statistics</strong>. On this page, you will find a lot of ready-made filters that will help you find the issues in the project. There are links to filter these issues by <strong>Status</strong>, <strong>Priority</strong>, <strong>Assignee</strong>, <strong>Component</strong>, and <strong>Issue Type</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_001.jpg" alt="Issues"/></div><p>
</p><p>Click on any of these links and the relevant issue will open in the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong>.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec30"/>Reports</h2></div></div></div><p>On this page, you will find the list of reports that come along with JIRA. These reports will always display real-time data of the project. There are some reporting add-ons that can be installed to bring additional reports in JIRA. In this chapter, we will take a look at one such add-on called Barcharts for JIRA.</p><p>The first set of reports are <strong>Agile</strong> reports:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_002.jpg" alt="Reports"/></div><p>
</p><p>The next set of reports are <strong>Issue analysis</strong> and <strong>Forecast &amp; management:</strong>
</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_003.jpg" alt="Reports"/></div><p>
</p><p>Under <strong>Reports</strong>, there are primarily three types of reports—<strong>Agile</strong>, <strong>Issue analysis</strong>, and <strong>Forecast &amp; management</strong>. We will discuss the <strong>Agile</strong> reports in <a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Working with Agile Boards in JIRA Software">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Working with JIRA Agile Boards in JIRA Software</em>. We will discuss the latter two types of reports here.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec3"/>The Average Age Report</h3></div></div></div><p>This report displays the average number of days for which issues are in an unresolved state on a given date.</p><p>Click on <strong>Average Age Report</strong> and, on a new page, specify <strong>Period</strong> and <strong>Days Previously</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_004.jpg" alt="The Average Age Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>By default, <strong>Days Previously</strong> is <code class="literal">30</code>, but we will generate the report for <code class="literal">60</code> days. Then, click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec0"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>This report has two sections:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">One is the bar chart that shows that average age of unresolved issues for a selected period</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Second is the table in the following screenshot that displays the actual number of unresolved issues on a specific date and their average age for a specific period of time</li></ul></div><p>Reading this chart is easy; if you see the bars increasing over a period of time, then it means that issues are not being resolved and action should be taken:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_005.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec4"/>The Created vs. Resolved Issues Report</h3></div></div></div><p>This report displays the number of issues that were created over a period of time versus the number of issues that were resolved in that period:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_006.jpg" alt="The Created vs. Resolved Issues Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>Enter the number of days for which you want to generate this report and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec1"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>In the following chart, you can see two lines; one line shows the number of issues created and the other line shows the number of issues resolved. Both these lines give a good indication of the overall progress. The following data table shows the issues created and resolved on a specific day in the selected period:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_007.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec5"/>The Pie Chart Report</h3></div></div></div><p>This chart shows the breakup of data. For instance, in your project, if you are interested to find out the issue count for all your issue types, then this report can be used to fetch this information:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_008.jpg" alt="The Pie Chart Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select <strong>Issue Type</strong> as the <strong>Statistic Type</strong> from the drop-down menu and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec2"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>The following pie chart shows the breakup of issue types and the <strong>Data Table</strong> shows the percentage of this distribution. A similar pie chart can also be generated for other fields (such as <strong>Assignee</strong>, <strong>Reporter</strong>, <strong>Components</strong>, <strong>Status</strong>, and so on):</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_009.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec6"/>The Recently Created Issues Report</h3></div></div></div><p>This report displays the statistical information for a number of issues recently created for <strong>Period</strong> and <strong>Days Previously</strong>. The report also displays the status of these issues:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_010.jpg" alt="The Recently Created Issues Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select <strong>Quarterly</strong> as the<strong> Period</strong>, enter <strong>Days Previously</strong> as <code class="literal">365</code>, and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec3"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>The following report displays the number of issues that were created versus resolved in past quarters. In this stacked bar chart, the unresolved issues are displayed at the bottom, whereas the resolved issues are displayed at the top. Looking at this report, you can easily find out about the project's overall progress in a particular quarter. The <strong>Data Table</strong> in the following figure shows the actual numbers that are depicted on the chart:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_011.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec7"/>The Resolution Time Report</h3></div></div></div><p>There are times when you are interested in understanding the speed of your team every month. How soon can your team resolve issues? This report displays the average resolution time of the issues in a given month:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_012.jpg" alt="The Resolution Time Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select <strong>Quarterly </strong>as the<strong> Period</strong>, enter <strong>Days Previously</strong> as <code class="literal">365</code>, and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec4"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>Looking at the following report, you can easily tell that in <strong>May-2014</strong>, the team took a lot of time to resolve issues. Keeping an eye on such information is crucial for managers to identify any challenges faced by the team and appropriate action can be taken to improve it:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_013.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec8"/>The Single Level Group By Report</h3></div></div></div><p>This is a simple report that just lists the issues grouped by a particular field (such as <strong>Assignee</strong>, <strong>Issue Type</strong>, <strong>Resolution</strong>, <strong>Status</strong>, <strong>Priority</strong>, and so on).</p><p>This report requires you to first create a filter. So, let's create a simple filter with the following JQL:</p><pre class="programlisting">project = cursor &#13;
</pre><p>Save this filter as <code class="literal">cursor_issues</code>. In <a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Searching in JIRA">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Searching in JIRA</em>, we discussed how to create a filter.</p><p>The name of the project for which we need to generate this report is <code class="literal">cursor</code>.</p><p>Now, when you click on the report link, you will be prompted to select the filter first and then select <strong>Statistic Type</strong>, that is, the field on which <code class="literal">group by</code> will be applied:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_014.jpg" alt="The Single Level Group By Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select <code class="literal">cursor_issues</code> as the <strong>Filter</strong>, select <strong>Assignee</strong> as the <strong>Statistic Type</strong>, and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec5"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>The following report displays all the issues of a particular filter, but grouped by <strong>Assignee</strong> name:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_015.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec9"/>The Time Since Issues Report</h3></div></div></div><p>This report is useful to find out how many issues were created in a specific quarter over the past year. Also, there are various date-based fields supported by this report; let's generate the report based on the resolved date:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_016.jpg" alt="The Time Since Issues Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select <strong>Resolved</strong> as the <strong>Date Field</strong> (you could also select other date-based fields), select <strong>Quarterly </strong>as the<strong> Period</strong>, and enter <code class="literal">365</code> in <strong>Days Previously</strong>. This will generate the report for the past year. Let <strong>Cumulative Totals?</strong> be <strong>Yes</strong>. Click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec6"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>This following report displays the information similar to the previous section, <em>The Resolution Time Report</em>, but this report can also be generated for other date fields in the issue, such as <strong>Created</strong>, <strong>Due Date</strong>, <strong>Last Viewed</strong>, <strong>Resolved</strong>, and <strong>Updated</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_017.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec10"/>The Time Tracking Report</h3></div></div></div><p>This comprehensive report displays the estimated effort and remaining effort of all the issues. The report will also give you an indication of the overall progress of the project:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_018.jpg" alt="The Time Tracking Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select <strong>Fix Version</strong> if you want to generate the report only for a specific version and <strong>Incomplete Issues only</strong> for <strong>Issues</strong>. Click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec7"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>In <strong>Issues</strong>, there are fields such as <strong>Time Estimates</strong>, <strong>Remaining Time</strong>, and <strong>Work Log</strong>. When users start working on an issue, they can update the work log with the amount of work they have done so far. In your project, if most of the issues have <strong>Time Estimates</strong> filled, then it will become important to find out the status of all such issues. This is a detailed report that will display the estimated time, the remaining time, and the total time for all the issues. This is a useful report for time-tracking and costing purposes:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_019.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p><p>The report also displays the <strong>Total</strong> at the end:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_020.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec11"/>The User Workload Report</h3></div></div></div><p>This report can tell us about the occupancy of various resources in all the projects. It really helps in distributing the tasks among users:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_021.jpg" alt="The User Workload Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select the <strong>User</strong> for which you want to generate this report, select <strong>Only including sub-tasks assigned to the selected user </strong>for <strong>Sub-task Inclusion</strong> so that no other subtasks which are assigned to other users within a parent issue will be considered when calculating the workload, and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_022.jpg" alt="The User Workload Report"/></div><p>
</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec8"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>Usually, in any company, users work on multiple projects simultaneously. In JIRA, there can be several projects, and users might be assigned to issues of more than one project, which can be managed by other project managers. You can assign a task to any user and also expect the task to be resolved by the given date, but this user might be over allocated. This report can tell you the workload of a particular user on all projects.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl3sec12"/>The Version Workload Report</h3></div></div></div><p>If your project has various versions that are related to the actual releases or fixes, then it becomes important to understand the status of all such issues:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_023.jpg" alt="The Version Workload Report"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select the <strong>Version</strong> for which you want to generate the report and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl4sec9"/>Report interpretation</h4></div></div></div><p>This report will give you a summary for a particular version, where you can see all the users assigned to it along with the breakup type and time estimate for every issue. You can also find information such as how much time is remaining to release a fix and who the responsible person is:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_024.jpg" alt="Report interpretation"/></div><p>
</p></div></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec27"/>Configuring and sharing dashboards</h1></div></div></div><p>The moment you log in to your JIRA instance, you will be presented with JIRA's <strong>System Dashboard</strong>, which displays a lot of relevant information. This dashboard has boxes, known as gadgets, which contain the information; there are various gadgets to display the issues assigned to you: <strong>Activity Stream</strong>, <strong>Created vs. Resolved Chart</strong>, <strong>Pie Chart</strong>, and many more.</p><p>Apart from the default system dashboard, it's possible to create more dashboards, which can be customized and shared with other users. For instance, you can create a dashboard for your project and share it with other users who can also access it.</p><p>On the <strong>System Dashboard</strong>, click on the <strong>Tools</strong> option at the top-right corner and select <strong>Create Dashboard</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_025.jpg" alt="Configuring and sharing dashboards"/></div><p>
</p><p>Enter the name of the dashboard, a <strong>Description</strong>, and select whom you want to share it with:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_026.jpg" alt="Configuring and sharing dashboards"/></div><p>
</p><p>In our case, we want to share it with everyone, but it's also possible to share it with the JIRA group. Now click on the <strong>Add</strong> button.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip19"/>Tip</h3><p>The <strong>System Dashboard</strong> can only be modified by JIRA administrators; however, user-created dashboards can only be modified by their respective owners.</p></div></div><p>You will now get a blank dashboard with a two-column layout. You can now add gadgets of your choice in these two columns:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_027.jpg" alt="Configuring and sharing dashboards"/></div><p>
</p><p>It's also possible to change the layout of this dashboard. Click on the <strong>Edit Layout</strong> option in the top-right corner:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_029.jpg" alt="Configuring and sharing dashboards"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the overlay, we can choose different layouts. For instance, we can select a three-column layout and click on the <strong>Close</strong> button.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec28"/>Gadgets for reporting purposes</h1></div></div></div><p>JIRA comes with a lot of useful gadgets that you can add in the dashboard and use for reporting purposes. Additional gadgets can be added in JIRA by installing add-ons. Let's take a look at some of these gadgets.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec31"/>Activity Stream</h2></div></div></div><p>This gadget will display all the latest updates in your JIRA instance. It's also possible to limit this stream to a particular filter. This gadget is quite useful because it displays up-to-date information on the dashboard:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_030.jpg" alt="Activity Stream"/></div><p>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec32"/>Created vs. Resolved Chart</h2></div></div></div><p>The project <strong>Summary</strong> page has a chart to display all the issues that were created and resolved in the past 30 days. There is a similar gadget to display this information.</p><p>You can also change the duration from 30 days to whatever you like. This gadget can be created for a specific project:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_031.jpg" alt="Created vs. Resolved Chart"/></div><p>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec33"/>Pie Chart</h2></div></div></div><p>Just like the <strong>Pie Chart</strong>, which is there in project reports, there is a similar gadget that you can add in the dashboard. For instance, for a particular project, you can generate a <strong>Pie Chart</strong> based on <strong>Priority</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_032.jpg" alt="Pie Chart"/></div><p>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec34"/>Issue Statistics</h2></div></div></div><p>This gadget is quite useful in generating simple statistics for various fields. Here, we are interested in finding out the breakup of the project in terms of <strong>Issue Statistics</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_033.jpg" alt="Issue Statistics"/></div><p>
</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec35"/>Two Dimensional Filter Statistics</h2></div></div></div><p>The <strong>Issue Statistics</strong> gadget can display the breakup of project issues for every <strong>Status</strong>. What if you want to further segregate this information? For instance, how many issues are open and to which <strong>Issue Type</strong> they belong to? In such scenarios, <strong>Two Dimensional Filter Statistics</strong> can be used.</p><p>You just need to select two fields that will be used to generate this report, one for the <em>x</em> axis and another for the <em>y</em> axis:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_034.jpg" alt="Two Dimensional Filter Statistics"/></div><p>
</p><p>These are certain common gadgets that can be used in the dashboard; however, there are many more gadgets. Click on the <strong>Add Gadget</strong> option in the top-right corner to see all such gadgets in your JIRA instance. Some gadgets come out of the box with JIRA and others are part of add-ons that you can install.</p><p>After you select all these gadgets in your dashboard, this is how it looks:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_035.jpg" alt="Two Dimensional Filter Statistics"/></div><p>
</p><p>This is the new dashboard that we have just created and configured for a specific project, but it's also possible to create more than one dashboard. Just click on the <strong>Create Dashboard</strong> option under <strong>Tools</strong> in the top-right corner to add another dashboard.</p><p>If you have more than one dashboard, then you can switch between them using the links in the top-left corner of the screen, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_036.jpg" alt="Two Dimensional Filter Statistics"/></div><p>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl1sec29"/>Using add-on charts to visualize data</h1></div></div></div><p>Apart from the standard charts and gadgets that come with JIRA out of the box, there are certain free add-ons that can be installed to have more such useful charts. Let's take a look at these free plugins and the additional features that they offer.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec36"/>Barcharts for JIRA</h2></div></div></div><p>Just install this add-on and you will get the option to add a <strong>Barchart</strong> gadget in your instance. The bar chart that comes with this add-on offers a few additional features which are not available in standard charts.</p><p>We will generate a report similar to one we generated earlier in this chapter. We want to generate a 2D report on <strong>Issue Type</strong> and <strong>Status</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_037.jpg" alt="Barcharts for JIRA"/></div><p>
</p><p>As you can see, this is a stacked bar chart. Also, there is a detailed table just following the chart that displays the actual numbers.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch03lvl2sec37"/>Building advanced reports using eazyBI</h2></div></div></div><p>The default reports that come built-in with JIRA are quite good and useful. These gadgets can be configured to display a variety of statistics based on different fields associated with a particular project or filter. Although they are good, these reports and gadgets sometimes do not provide the exact consolidated information. One can also query the JIRA database directly to fetch the data and look for reports that are not available through the user interface, but not everyone can do that easily as it requires very good knowledge of the JIRA database. In <a class="link" href="ch13.html" title="Chapter 13. Database Access">Chapter 13</a>, <em>Database Access</em>, we will take a look at some queries that you can use to fetch data directly from the database. However, if you are looking for a better way to generate advanced reports then <strong>eazyBI</strong> is one of the best JIRA add-ons for reporting purposes.</p><p>In this section, we quickly want to walk you through this add-on and how you can use it to generate comprehensive reports:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to JIRA <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Add-ons</strong> | <strong>Find new add-ons</strong> under <strong>ATLASSIAN MARKETPLACE</strong> and search for <code class="literal">eazyBI</code> in the search box.</li><li class="listitem"><strong>eazyBI Reports and Charts for JIRA</strong> will appear.

</p><div><img src="img/image_03_041.jpg" alt="Building advanced reports using eazyBI"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">A new source will be added under <strong>Source Applications</strong>. You can also check the <strong>Status</strong> column, where it displays when the last import was performed. The import will happen as per the schedule, usually once a day but you can also click on the <strong>Import</strong> button to pull data from JIRA:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_03_042.jpg" alt="Building advanced reports using eazyBI"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Analyze</strong> link in the <strong>eazyBI</strong> menu on top and you will find three sample reports. Click on <strong>Sample created vs resolved issues</strong>:<p>

</p></li><li class="listitem">The <strong>Dimensions</strong> section on top contains all the fields that are available to us; the <strong>Pages</strong> section contains the fields that act as a filter on the current report. The <strong>Rows</strong> and <strong>Columns</strong> sections contain the two fields based on which the report will be generated. You can drag more fields from <strong>Dimensions</strong> to any of these three sections. The following sample report is based on <strong>Line</strong> but you can select <strong>Bar</strong>, <strong>Pie</strong>, and several other types of graphs. The best thing about eazyBI is that these reports are drill-through reports, in other words, you can click on the specific section of the report and analyze that portion separately. You can add more reports based on any field of your choice.</li><li class="listitem">To view the reports, go to <strong>Dashboards</strong> in the <strong>eazyBI</strong> menu and add a new dashboard.
