    Scrum agile methodology. Jira Software also supports another agile methodology
    called Kanban, which many agile teams have chosen to use instead of Scrum. In
    this chapter, we will look at how to use Jira Software for Kanban.

    Scrum (which was introduced in [Chapter 2](part0033.html#VF2I0-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11),
    *Jira Software for Scrum*), which revolves around the notion of running your project
    in planned iterations called sprints, Kanban does not run in iterations, or rather,
    the use of iteration is optional with Kanban.

  prefs:
  - PREF_UL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While Scrum requires the team to plan iterative sprints with managed scopes,
    and focuses on team velocity, Kanban is more flexible, as its focus is more around
    **cycle time**. Cycle time is the measurement of the amount of time it takes for
    an issue, or unit of work, to transition through the team's workflow from end
    to end. The goal is to reduce the cycle time, identify any problems and bottlenecks
    in the workflow, and address them to get the process to flow smoothly again. As
    we will see, Jira provides a number of tools to help with this.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So, let's take a closer look at the Kanban board and see why we have these differences.
    First of all, as explained in the earlier section, Kanban does not use discrete
    time periods, such as iterations, to plan work in advance. Instead, work is being
    done constantly, going from the backlog to the finish line to be released. Therefore,
    the Kanban board does not have separate views for the backlog (or a Plan mode,
    in older versions of Jira Software) and the current active sprints (or Work mode);
    everything is combined into this single Kanban board view, which shows you everything
    in your backlog and the current progress as your team works through the issues.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The first column on the board will be your backlog, and it is called Backlog
    by default if you are not using a customized board and/or workflow. Any new issues
    created will be automatically placed into that column. However, if you have a
    big project, you may find this hard to maintain as the number of issues grows.
    In this case, Jira provides an option to have a backlog view like a Scrum board
    by using what is known as **Kanplan**. We will cover Kanplan in [Chapter 4](part0074.html#26I9K0-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11),

    understand what the team is currently working on, what the workload is like, and
    where in the workflow a given task is. So the first step is to set up your board
    columns to visually represent what your workflow looks like.

    or right on the list so that it is in the correct position in your workflow.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When adding a column this way, a corresponding new status with the same name
    will also be created for you, if one does not already exist. So you do not have
    to create both the column and status separately.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Generally speaking, your board should reflect how work progresses through your
    workflow, so you should have a column for each major step that members of your
    team will be working on. For example, if you have the steps In Development, Development
    Completed, and In Testing in your workflow, you should have two columns, one for
    In Development and one for In Testing. The reason why you should not have a column
    for Development Completed is because nobody will be working on the issues that
    are in the step.

- en: Setting up column constraints
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As stated earlier, one of the key differences between Scrum and Kanban is that
    Scrum limits the amount of work per iteration and Kanban limits the amount of
    work per workflow status. This is done by setting **column constraints**. Column
    constraints tell Jira the maximum and/or the minimum number of issues that should
    be in a column at any given time.

    see that too many issues are in the In Progress column, and at the same time,
    we don''t have enough issues in the QA column. What this tells us is that we have
    a bottleneck in our development phase of the workflow. This results in work being
    piled up in development while the QA engineers are waiting around and not being
    productive:'

- en: So in order to address this, as a team you will need to take a close look at
    the bottleneck—in this case, the In Progress column—and figure out why this is
    happening. For example, perhaps you do not have enough developers to handle the
    workload and people are multitasking in order to try to complete as much work
    as possible. This will often cause unnecessary context switching, which in turn
    causes inefficiency, or perhaps the tasks are too complicated and need to be broken
    down.

    to visually identify whether there are any bottlenecks in a particular status

    the key concept with Kanban. We also looked at some of the charts that are available
