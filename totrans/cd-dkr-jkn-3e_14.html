			<h1 id="_idParaDest-279"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/></em><a href="B18223_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>: Introducing Continuous Delivery</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>Development, quality assurance, operations.</li>
				<li>Continuous integration, automated acceptance testing, configuration management.</li>
				<li>Fast delivery, fast feedback cycle, low-risk releases, flexible release options.</li>
				<li>Unit tests, integration tests, acceptance tests, non-functional tests (performance, security, scalability, and so on).</li>
				<li>Unit tests, because they are cheap to create/maintain and quick to execute.</li>
				<li>DevOps is the idea of combining the areas of development, quality assurance, and operations into one team (or person). Thanks to automation, it's possible to provide the product from A to Z.</li>
				<li>Docker, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform, Git, Java, Spring Boot, Gradle, Cucumber, Kubernetes.</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">Containerization does not emulate the whole operating system; it uses the host operating system instead. </li>
				<li>The benefits of providing an application as a Docker image are as follows:<ol><li><strong class="bold">No issues with dependencies</strong>: The application is provided together with its dependencies.</li><li><strong class="bold">Isolation</strong>: The application is isolated from the other applications running on the same machine.</li><li><strong class="bold">Portability</strong>: The application runs everywhere, no matter which environment dependencies are present.</li></ol></li>
				<li>No, the Docker daemon can run natively only on Linux machines. However, there are well-integrated virtual environments for both Windows and Mac.</li>
				<li>A Docker image is a stateless, serialized collection of files and the recipe of how to use them; a Docker container is a running instance of the Docker image.</li>
				<li>A Docker image is built on top of another Docker image, which makes the layered structure. This mechanism is user-friendly and saves bandwidth and storage.</li>
				<li>Docker Commit and Dockerfile.</li>
				<li><code>docker build</code>.</li>
				<li><code>docker run</code>.</li>
				<li>Publishing a port means that the host's port is forwarded to the container's port.</li>
				<li>A Docker volume is the Docker host's directory mounted inside the container.</li>
			</ol>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">Yes, and the image name is <code>jenkins/jenkins</code>.</li>
				<li>A Jenkins master is the main instance that schedules tasks and provides the web interface, while a Jenkins agent (slave) is the additional instance that's only dedicated to executing jobs.</li>
				<li>Vertical scaling means adding more resources to the machine while the load increases. Horizontal scaling means adding more machines while the load increases.</li>
				<li>SSH and Java Web Start.</li>
				<li>A permanent agent is the simplest solution, and it means creating a static server with all the environments prepared to execute a Jenkins job. On the other hand, a permanent Docker agent is more flexible; it provides the Docker daemon, and all the jobs are executed inside Docker containers.</li>
				<li>In case you use dynamically provisioned Docker agents and the standard ones (available on the internet) do not provide the execution environment you need.</li>
				<li>When your organization needs some templated Jenkins to be used by different teams.</li>
				<li>Blue Ocean is a Jenkins plugin that provides a more modern Jenkins web interface.</li>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">A pipeline is a sequence of automated operations that usually represents a part of the software delivery and quality assurance process.</li>
				<li>A step is a single automated operation, while a stage is a logical grouping of steps used to visualize the Jenkins pipeline process.</li>
				<li>The <code>post</code> section defines a series of one or more step instructions that are run at the end of the pipeline build.</li>
				<li>Checkout, compile, and unit test.</li>
				<li>Jenkinsfile is a file with the Jenkins pipeline definition (usually stored together with the source code in the repository).</li>
				<li>The code coverage stage is responsible for checking whether the source code is well covered with (unit) tests.</li>
				<li>An external trigger is a call from an external repository (such as GitHub) to the Jenkins master, while Polling SCM is a periodic call from the Jenkins master to the external repository.</li>
				<li>Email, group chat, build radiators, sms, rss feed.</li>
				<li>Trunk-based workflow, branching workflow, and forking workflow.</li>
				<li>A feature toggle is a technique that is used to disable the feature for users but enable it for developers while testing. Feature toggles are essentially variables used in conditional statements.</li>
			</ol>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">Docker Registry is a stateless application server that stores Docker images.</li>
				<li>Docker Hub is the best-known public Docker registry.</li>
				<li>The convention is <code>&lt;registry_address&gt;/&lt;image_name&gt;:&lt;tag&gt;</code>.</li>
				<li>The staging environment is the preproduction environment dedicated to integration and acceptance testing.</li>
				<li>The following commands: <code>docker build</code>, <code>docker login</code>, and <code>docker push</code>.</li>
				<li>They allow us to specify tests in a human-readable format, which helps with collaboration between businesses and developers.</li>
				<li>Acceptance criteria (feature scenario specification), step definitions, test runner.</li>
				<li>Acceptance test-driven development is a development methodology (seen as an extension of TDD) that says to always start the development process from the (failing) acceptance tests.</li>
			</ol>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">A server cluster is a set of connected computers that work together in such a way that they can be used similarly within a single system.</li>
				<li>Kubernetes Node is just a worker, that is, a host that runs containers. Kubernetes Control Plane Master is responsible for everything else (providing the Kubernetes API, Pod orchestration, and more).</li>
				<li>Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services.</li>
				<li>Deployment is a Kubernetes resource that's responsible for Pod orchestration (creating, terminating, and more). Service is an (internal) load balancer that provides a way to expose Pods.</li>
				<li><code>kubectl scale</code>.</li>
				<li>Docker Swarm and Mesos.</li>
			</ol>

			<ol>
				<li value="1">Configuration management is the process of controlling the configuration changes in a way such that the system maintains integrity over time.</li>
				<li>Agentless means that you don't need to install any special tool (an agent or daemon) in the server that is being managed.</li>
				<li>Ansible, Chef, and Puppet.</li>
				<li>An inventory is a file that contains a list of servers that are managed by Ansible.</li>
				<li>An ad hoc command is a single command that is executed on servers, and playbooks are the entire configurations (sets of scripts) that are executed on servers.</li>
				<li>An Ansible role is a well-structured playbook prepared to be included in the playbooks.</li>
				<li>Ansible Galaxy is a store (repository) for Ansible roles.</li>
				<li>Infrastructure as code is the process of managing and provisioning computing resources instead of physical hardware configurations.</li>
				<li>Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, Azure Resource Manager, Google Cloud Deployment Manager, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Pulumi, Vagrant.</li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-286"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/></em><a href="B18223_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor218"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>: Continuous Delivery Pipeline</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Production, staging, QA, development.</li>
				<li>Staging is the preproduction environment used to test software before the release; QA is a separate environment used by the QA team and the dependent applications.</li>
				<li>Performance, load, stress, scalability, endurance, security, maintainability, recovery.</li>
				<li>No, but it should be explicit which are part of the pipeline, and which are not (and for those that are not, there should still be some automation and monitoring around).</li>
				<li>Semantic versioning, timestamp-based, hash-based.</li>
				<li>A smoke test is a very small subset of acceptance tests whose only purpose is to check that the release process is completed successfully.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-287"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/></em><a href="B18223_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor242"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>: Advanced Continuous Delivery</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Database schema migration is a process of incremental changes to the relational database structure.</li>
				<li>Flyway, Liquibase, Rail migrations (from Ruby on Rails), Redgate, Optima database administrator.</li>
				<li>Backward-compatible and non-backward-compatible.</li>
				<li>If one database is shared between multiple services, then each database change must be compatible with all services, which makes changes very difficult to initiate.</li>
				<li>Unit tests do not require the preparation of any special data; data is in memory and prepared by developers; integration/acceptance tests require the preparation of special data that is similar to production data.</li>
				<li>Parallel.</li>
				<li>Build parameters and shared libraries.</li>
				<li>Input.</li>
				<li>Rolling updates, blue-green deployment, and canary release.</li>
