    repository. What is on the remote repository may or may not be the same for any
    given branch depending on whether you've pushed all your commits. In *Chapter
    6*, *Interactive Rebasing*, we'll review why you might want to hold on to a number
    of commits before pushing them (in short, you will have the ability to combine
    commits to reduce the number of commits a reviewer must slog through).

    to the appropriate directory, and then double-click on `ProGitForProgrammers.sln`.

    so. Be careful with the `restore` command, however. If you use it as shown with
    the `--staged` flag you will unstage your file, but if you leave out the flag
    you will restore your file to your last commit, **losing all the work you've done
