- en: Such an answer was usually followed with disappointment. Docker Compose showed
    us the advantages of specifying everything in a YAML file as opposed to trying
    to remember all the arguments we have to pass to docker commands. It allowed us
    to store service definitions in a repository thus providing a reproducible and
    well-documented process for managing them. Docker Compose replaced bash scripts,
    and we loved it. Then, Docker v1.12 came along and put a difficult choice in front
    of us. Should we adopt Swarm and discard Compose? Since summer 2016, Swarm and
    Compose were not in love anymore. It was a painful divorce.

    arguments. In this case, we are specifying that the `proxy` service should have
    two replicas while the `swarm-listener` service should be constrained to manager
    roles. Everything else defined for those two services is using the same format
    as in earlier Compose versions.

    within services. If a service does not specify any, the default network will be
    created automatically. In this case, we opted for manual creation of a network
    since services from other stacks should be able to communicate with the `proxy`.
    Therefore, we created a network manually and defined it as external in the YAML
    file.

    each other through the default network that will be created automatically by the
    stack (no need for `docker network create` command). Since the main service is
    an API, it should be accessible through the `proxy`, so we're attaching `proxy`
    network as well.

  zh: 这个 stack 定义了两个服务（`main` 和 `db`）。它们将通过 stack 自动创建的默认网络进行通信（无需使用 `docker network
    create` 命令）。由于主服务是 API，因此它应该能够通过 `proxy` 访问，所以我们也将 `proxy` 网络附加上。
- en: The important thing to note is that we used the deploy section to define `Swarm-specific`
    arguments. In this case, the main service defines that there should be three replicas
    and a few labels. As with the previous stack, we won't go into details of each
    service. If you'd like to go into more depth of the labels used with the main
    service, please visit the *Running Docker Flow Proxy In Swarm Mode With Automatic

    to pull it, resulting in a few failures. The `go-demo` service is designed to
    fail if it cannot connect to its database. Once the `db` service is running, the
    main service should stop failing, and we'll see three replicas with the current
    state `Running`.

- en: Docker stack is a great addition to the Swarm Mode. We do not have to deal with
    `docker service create` commands that tend to have a never ending list of arguments.
    With services specified in Compose YAML files, we can replace those long commands
    with a simple `docker stack deploy`. If those YAML files are stored in code repositories,
    we can apply the same practices to service deployments as to any other area of
    software engineering. We can track changes, do code reviews, share with others,
    and so on.

  zh: Docker stack 是 Swarm 模式的一个重要补充。我们不再需要处理那些通常有着无穷参数列表的 `docker service create`
    命令。通过在 Compose YAML 文件中指定服务，我们可以用一个简单的 `docker stack deploy` 来替代这些长长的命令。如果这些 YAML
    文件存储在代码仓库中，我们可以将相同的实践应用到服务部署中，就像处理其他软件工程领域一样。我们可以追踪更改，进行代码审查，与他人共享等等。
