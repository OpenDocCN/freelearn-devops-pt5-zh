			<p>Every good agilist knows that individuals and interactions are valued over processes and tools. This first tenet of the manifesto endures two decades since its formation. Yet in today's world of digital disruption, the right practices and tools can mean the difference between surviving and thriving.</p>
			<p>What if we told you about a tool that was built by agilists for agilists, supports all leading frameworks, enables you to scale agility from the team to the enterprise, and visualizes all key dimensions including people, work, time, and outcomes? Well, that tool is here, and it's called Jira Align.</p>
			<p>This book serves as a foundation for those who are looking to begin their journey with Jira Align and a companion to those who already use Jira Align. Starting with an introduction to the platform and its features, you'll learn how to implement and leverage Jira Align to maximize outcomes and mitigate common team, program, and portfolio-level challenges in enterprises.</p>
			<p>Get ready for a wealth of knowledge on this leading <strong class="bold">enterprise agile planning</strong> (<strong class="bold">EAP</strong>) platform. From running remote agile ceremonies, to generating live product roadmaps, to tracking <strong class="bold">objectives and key results</strong> (<strong class="bold">OKRs</strong>), you'll learn all the key features of Jira Align and how they support agility at every level of scale.</p>
			<p>Thank you for joining us and may you find much success in your journey!</p>
