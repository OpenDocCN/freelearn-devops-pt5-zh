<p class="calibre3">In the previous chapters, we created both Scrum and Kanban projects using Jira's agile project templates. With these templates, a default set of configurations is automatically created and applied to our projects, such as the types of issue we can create and fields that we need to fill in when creating new issues. As your projects become more complex and new requirements come up, you will quickly find you need to be able to have more control over your project settings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of the chapter, you will have learned how to:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Create your own issue types and make them available to your projects</li>
<li class="calibre9">Add new custom fields to collect more relevant data from users</li>
<li class="calibre9">Customize workflows to better mimic your processes</li>
<li class="calibre9">Secure your Jira with different levels of permission control</li>
<li class="calibre9">Manage email notifications sent out from Jira to notify users of changes to issues</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Customizing issue types</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Each issue has a type (therefore, the name "issue type"), which is represented by the issue type field. This lets you know what type of issue it is; for example, if the issue is a bug or a feature. Jira comes with a list of pre-defined issue types, such as Story, Epic, and Task.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The default issue types are great for simple software development projects, but they do not necessarily meet the needs of others. Since it is impossible to create a system that can address everyone's needs, Jira lets you create your own issue types and assigns them to projects. For example, for a help desk project, you might want to create a custom issue type called <strong class="calibre1">ticket</strong>. You can create this custom issue type and assign it to the Help Desk project and users will be able to log tickets, instead of bugs, in the system as shown here:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Log in to Jira as a Jira administrator.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>

<ol start="7" class="calibre14">
<li value="7" class="calibre9">Click on Add to create the new issue type.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">After you have created your new issue type, you will need to make it available to the project. You can do this by adding the new issue type to the <em class="calibre2">issue type scheme</em> used by the project. An issue type scheme contains a list of issue types, and is applied to one or more projects. This way, a project can have its own set of issue types, or have a shared set of issue types with other similar projects. To add your new issue type to an issue type scheme:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Adding new custom fields</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Just like issue types, Jira comes with a number of built-in fields. You have already seen a few of them in the previous chapters. For example, when creating new stories for your agile boards, there are fields such as summary, priority, and assignee. These fields make up the backbone of an issue, and you cannot remove them from the system. For this reason, they are referred to as <strong class="calibre1">system fields</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">While Jira's built-in fields are quite comprehensive for agile software development uses, most organizations soon find they have special requirements that cannot be addressed simply with the default fields available. To help you tailor Jira to your organization's needs, Jira lets you create and add your own fields to the system, called <strong class="calibre1">custom fields</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Jira comes with many types of custom fields, ranging from simple text fields, and select lists, to more complex ones, such as cascading select lists and user selectors. And if you find these are not sufficient enough, there are many more you can get from the Atlassian Marketplace, where you can find more specialized fields that talk to Salesforce.com, and many more. To start adding new custom fields to Jira:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the Issues tab and then the Custom fields option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click on the Add Custom Field button. This will bring you to step 1 of the process, where you can select the custom field type.</li>
<li class="calibre9" value="4">Search and select the custom field type you wish to add, and click on Next. This will bring you to step 2 of the process, where you can specify the custom field's name and options:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone72" src="img/00082.jpeg"/></div>
<p>If you do not see the field type you are looking for, select the All option from the left-hand side and then search again.</p>
<ol start="5" class="calibre14">
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Enter values for the Name and Description fields. If you are creating a selection-based custom field, such as a select list, you will need to add its select options too (you can update this list later):</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone73" src="img/00083.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="6" class="calibre14">
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on the Create button. This will bring you to the last step of the process, where you can specify the screen to which you would like to add the field.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre9">Select the screens and click on Update. The following screenshot shows that the newly created field has been added to both of the support screens:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone74" src="img/00084.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After you have created the custom field, you can always come back later and customize it. For example, with our origin select list field, we have added three options when creating the field. If more options are needed, we can edit the field and add more options to it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Customizing Jira workflows</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Up until now, all the Scrum and Kanban projects we have created have their own workflow, named <kbd class="calibre12">Software Simplified Workflow</kbd> for Project X, and this is what is called the <strong class="calibre1">Simplified Workflow</strong>. A simplified workflow is a type of workflow that is designed specifically to work with agile projects, by having minimum restrictions. This means:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">There is a pre-defined set of statuses/columns for both Scrum and Kanban</li>
<li class="calibre9">Board administrators can easily make changes, by simply adding and removing columns</li>
<li class="calibre9">Issues can be moved between the statuses/columns freely with no restrictions</li>
<li class="calibre9">There are no intermediate screens when an issue is being moved</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">This is great for most standard agile projects, where the goal is to have a straightforward workflow, and freedom for team members to move issues on the board as needed. However, sometimes you will have special requirements around your processes and your workflow will need to reflect those. For example, you might have a validation requirement that an issue can only be closed if a quality assurance engineer has signed off on it, or you might have a security requirement that only members of a certain group can move an issue to a target status.</p>
<p class="calibre3">These requirements may seem counter-intuitive in an agile environment, but remember that nothing is a one size fits all solution, and Jira lets you customize the workflow used by your project to best fulfill all your needs.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Jira comes with a very intuitive graphical tool to help you, as a Jira administrator, to create and customize your workflows. The following is a screenshot of how Jira visually represents a workflow in the tool:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone75" src="img/00085.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Each <strong class="calibre1">status</strong> is represented as a box. Each <strong class="calibre1">transition</strong> is represented as a line between two statuses. When clicking on either a status or a transition, a properties panel will appear on the right-hand side, allowing you to further customize it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Authoring a workflow</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">So, let's take a look at how to create and set up a new workflow in Jira. To create a new workflow, all you need is a name and description:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the Issues tab and then the Workflows option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click on the Add Workflow button.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Enter a name and description for the new workflow in the Add Workflow dialog.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to create the workflow.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">The newly created workflow will only contain the default create and open status, so you will need to configure it by adding new statuses and transitions to make it useful. Let's start with adding new statuses to the workflow using the following steps:</p>
<ol start="1" class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Add status button.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select an existing status from the drop-down list. If the status you need does not exist, you can create a new status by entering its name and pressing the <em class="calibre2">Enter</em> key on your keyboard.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Check the Allow all statuses to transition to this one option, if you want users to be able to move the issue into this status regardless of its current status. This will create a <strong class="calibre1">Global Transition</strong>, which is a convenient way to allow an issue to use this transition from any status to get to the target status.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="4" class="calibre14">
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to add the status to your workflow. You can repeat these steps to add as many statuses as you want to your workflow:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone76" src="img/00086.jpeg"/></div>
<p>Try to re-use existing statuses if possible, so you do not end up with many similar statuses to manage.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that the statuses are added to the workflow, they need to be linked with transitions, so issues can move from one status to the next. There are two ways to create a transition:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Click on the Add transition button or you can follow the next step</li>
<li class="calibre9">Select the originating status, then click and drag the arrow to the destination status</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Both options will bring up the Add transition dialog, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone77" src="img/00087.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">From the preceding screenshot, you can choose to either create a new transition with the New Transition tab or use an existing transition with the Reuse a transition tab.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When creating a new transition, you will need to configure the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">From status: The originating status. The transition will be available when the issue is in the selected status.</li>
<li class="calibre9">To status: The destination status. Once the transition is executed, the issue will be put into the selected status.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Name: Name of the transition. This is the text that will be displayed to users. It is usually a good idea to name your transitions starting with a verb, such as <kbd class="calibre12">Close Issue</kbd> or <kbd class="calibre12">Submit for Review</kbd>.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Description: An optional text description is the purpose of this transition. This will not be displayed to users.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Screen: An optional intermediate screen to be displayed when users execute the transition. For example, you display a screen to capture additional data as part of the transition. If you do not select a screen, the transition will be executed immediately. The following screenshot shows a workflow screen:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class="alignnone78" src="img/00088.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">If you want to reuse an existing transition, simply select the Reuse a transition tab, the From status and To status, and the transition to reuse, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone79" src="img/00089.jpeg"/></div>
<p>Jira will only list valid transitions based on the To status selection.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You might be wondering when you should create a new transition and when you should reuse an existing transition. The big difference between the two is that when you reuse a transition, all instances of the reused transition, also known as <strong class="calibre1">common transition</strong>, will share the same set of configurations, such as conditions and validators. Also, any changes made to the transition will be applied to all instances. A good use case for this is when you need to have multiple transitions with the same name and setup, such as Close Issue; instead of creating separate transitions each time, you can create one transition and reuse it whenever you need a transition to close an issue. Later on, if you need to add a new validator to the transition to validate additional user input, you will only need to make the change once, rather than multiple times for each Close Issue transition.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Another good practice to keep in mind is to not have a <em class="calibre2">dead end</em> state in your workflow, for example, allowing closed issues to be reopened. This will prevent users from accidentally closing an issue and not being able to correct the mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we have seen how to add new statuses and transitions to a workflow, let's look at adding conditions, validators, and post functions to a transition.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Adding a condition to transitions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">New transitions do not have any conditions by default. This means that anyone who has access to the issue will be able to execute the transition. By adding a condition to a workflow transition, you can control who or when an issue can be transitioned.</p>
<p>Conditions take place before a transition is executed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Jira allows you to add any number of conditions to the transition:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Select the transition you want to add conditions to.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Conditions link.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click on the Add condition link. This will bring you to the Add Condition To transition page, which lists all the available conditions you can add.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Select the condition you want to add.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to add the condition.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Depending on the condition, you may be presented with the Add Parameters To Condition page, where you can specify the configuration options for the condition. For example, the User Is In Group condition will ask you to select the group to check against.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Newly added conditions are appended to the end of the existing list of conditions, creating a <strong class="calibre1">condition group</strong>. By default, when there is more than one condition, a logical <kbd class="calibre12">AND</kbd> is used to group the conditions. This means that all conditions must pass for the entire condition group to pass. If one condition fails, the entire group fails, and the user will not be able to execute the transition. You can switch to use a logical <kbd class="calibre12">OR</kbd>, which means only one of the conditions in the group needs to pass for the entire group to pass. This is a very useful feature as it allows you to combine multiple conditions to form a more complex logical unit.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For example, the <strong class="calibre1">User Is In Group</strong> condition lets you specify a single group, but with the <kbd class="calibre12">AND</kbd> operator, you can add multiple <strong class="calibre1">User Is In Group</strong> conditions to ensure the user must exist in all the specific groups to be able to execute the transition. If you use the <kbd class="calibre12">OR</kbd> operator, then the user will only need to belong to one of the listed groups. The only restriction to this is that you cannot use both operators for the same condition group.</p>
<p>One transition can only have one condition group, and each condition group can only have one logical operator.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Adding a validator to transitions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Like conditions, transitions, by default, do not have any validators associated. This means transitions are completed as soon as they are executed. You can add validators to transitions to make sure that executions are only allowed to be completed when certain criteria are met. One good use case of validators is when a transition has a workflow screen to capture user input, and you need to validate the inputs, such as date format.</p>
<p>Validators take place during a transition execution.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perform the following steps to add a validator to a transition:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Select the transition you want to add validators to.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Validators link.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click on the Add validator link. This will bring you to the Add Validator To Transition page, which lists all the available validators you can add.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Select the validator you want to add.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to add the validator.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Depending on the validator, you may be presented with the Add Parameters To Validator page where you can specify configuration options for the validator. For example, the Permissions validator will ask you to select the permission to validate against.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Similar to conditions, when there are multiple validators added to a transition, they form a <strong class="calibre1">validator group</strong>. Unlike conditions, you can only use a logical <kbd class="calibre12">AND</kbd> for the group. This means that in order to complete a transition, every validator added to the transition must pass its validation criteria. Transitions cannot selectively pass validations using a logical <kbd class="calibre12">OR</kbd>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The following screenshot shows a validator being placed on the transition, validating if the user has entered a value for the Resolution Details field:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone80" src="img/00090.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Adding a post function to transitions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Transitions, by default, are created with several post functions. These post functions provide key services to Jira's internal operations, so they cannot be deleted from the transition. These post functions perform the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Set the issue status to the linked status of the destination workflow step</li>
<li class="calibre9">Add a comment to an issue if one is entered during a transition</li>
<li class="calibre9">Update the change history for an issue and store the issue in the database</li>
<li class="calibre9">Re-index an issue to keep indexes in sync with the database</li>
<li class="calibre9">Fire an event that can be processed by the listeners</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">As you can see, these post functions provide some of the basic functions such as updating a search index and setting an issue's status after transition execution, which are essential in Jira. Therefore, instead of users having to manually add them in and risk the possibility of leaving one or more out, Jira adds them for you automatically when you create a new transition.</p>
<p>Post functions take place after a transition has successfully executed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Perform the following steps to add a post function to a transition:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Select the transition you want to add post functions to.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Post Functions link.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click on the Add post function link and select the post function you want to add.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to add the post function.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Depending on the post function, you may be presented with the Add Parameters To Function page, where you can specify configuration options for the post function. The following screenshot shows an example from the Update Issue Field post function:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone81" src="img/00091.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Just like conditions and validators, multiple post functions form a post function group in a transition. After a transition is executed, each post function in the group is executed sequentially as it appears in the list, from top to bottom. If any post function in the group encounters an error during processing, you will receive an error, and the remaining post functions will not be executed.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since post functions are executed sequentially and some of them possess the abilities to modify values and perform other tasks, often, their sequence of execution becomes very important. For example, if you have a post function that changes the issue's assignee to the current user and another post function that updates an issue field's value with the issue's assignee, obviously the update assignee post function needs to occur first, so you need to make sure it is above the other post function.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can move the positions of post functions up and down along the list by clicking on the Move Up and Move Down links. Note that not all post functions can be repositioned.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Managing Jira permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Security is the top most important priority in today's digital world. Ensuring only authorized personnel will have access to the data stored in Jira to prevent any potential information leak is something every Jira administrator needs to keep track of. To ensure there are proper security controls in place, Jira provides a number of options to control access permissions to the data it stores.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Global permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Global permissions, as the name suggests, is the highest permission level in Jira. These are coarse-grained permissions applied globally across Jira, controlling broad security levels, such as the ability to administer various configuration settings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Global permissions can only be granted to groups. For this reason, you will need to organize your users into logical groups for global permissions to take effect. For example, you will want to have all your administrators belong to a single group, such as the <kbd class="calibre12">JIRA-administrators</kbd> group, so you can grant them administration permission:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">

<p>A user with Jira Administrators' global permission cannot grant himself/herself Jira System Administrators' global permission.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Project permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As you have seen, global permissions controls mostly administration-level accesses, and in most cases, you will need the ability to control access to projects, such as who will be able to view and create new issues. This is where <strong class="calibre1">permission schemes</strong> come in.</p>
<p class="calibre3">A permission scheme defines a list of permissions available in Jira, such as who can delete an issue, and who can add comments, and lets you grant each permission to different users. This mapping of permission types to user definitions make up the permission scheme. Once you have defined the mapping for your scheme, you can then apply it to one or more projects. This gives you the flexibility to define unique permission settings for each project, as well as share and apply the same permission settings to multiple projects. To start working with permission schemes, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the Issues tab and then the Permission schemes option. By default, there should be two permission schemes already defined:
<ul class="calibre20">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Default permission scheme:</strong> Default scheme used by non-agile projects.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Default software scheme:</strong> Default scheme used by all agile (Scrum and Kanban) projects.<br class="title-page-name"/>
You can update the permission settings for the existing schemes by clicking on the Permissions link, which will affect all existing projects using the scheme, or create a new scheme by clicking the Add permission scheme button.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Once you have either selected or created the permission scheme you wish to configure, you will be taken to the <strong class="calibre1">Edit Permissions</strong> page, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone83" src="img/00093.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">On this page, you will be presented with a list of project level permissions, along with short descriptions for each, and the users, groups, and roles that are linked to each of the permissions. You will notice that for the default permission scheme, most of the permission options have default users linked to them through project roles. If you are looking at a new permission scheme, there will be no users linked to any of the permissions. This is your one-page view of permission settings for projects, and you will also be able to add and delete users. To grant a permission to users:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Grant permission button or the Edit link for a specific permission.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the permissions you wish to grant the user.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select the user option to specify whom to grant the permission to. Click on the Show more link to see more options.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Click on the Grant button to grant the selected permission.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="5" class="calibre14">
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Repeat this process to grant more users to the permission:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone84" src="img/00094.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">A permission option such as <strong class="calibre1">User Custom Field Value</strong> is a very flexible way to allow end users to control access. For example, you can have a custom field called <strong class="calibre1">Editors</strong>, and set up your Edit Issues permission to allow only users specified in the custom field to be able to edit issues. The custom field does not have to be placed on the usual view/edit screens for the permission to be applied. For example, you can have the custom field appear on a workflow transition called Submit to Manager; once the user has selected the manager, only the manager will have permission to edit the issue.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Issue permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">A project level permission with a permission scheme is usually all you will need with your security requirements. However, sometimes you might need to take things one step further and control access permission on a per issue basis. One example of such a use case is when you have both internal and external users, such as customers working on the same project, and there are issues you do not want to share with your outside customers. In these cases, you can use <strong class="calibre1">issue security schemes</strong>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Issue security allows users to set view permissions (not edit) on issues by selecting one of the preconfigured issue security levels from the system Security Level field. On a high level, issue security works in a similar way to permission schemes. The Jira administrator will start by creating and configuring a set of issue security schemes with security levels set. Project administrators can then apply one of these schemes to their projects, which allows the users (with Set Issue Security project permission) to select the security levels within the scheme and apply them to individual issues.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The starting point of using issue security is the issue security scheme. It is the responsibility of the Jira administrator to create and design the security levels so they can be reused as much as possible:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the Issues tab and then the Issue security schemes option. Unlike permission schemes, there are no default issue security schemes available.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click on the Add Issue Security Scheme button.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Enter a name and description for the new scheme.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to create the new issue security scheme.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on the Security Levels link for the issue security scheme we just created. New issue security schemes do not contain any security levels, so we will need to add them manually.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre9">Enter a name and description for the new security level in the Add Security Level section and click on the Add Security Level button. Repeat this step to add more security levels. With the security levels in place, we can now assign users who will have a view permission for each of the security levels.</li>
<li value="8" class="calibre9">Click on the Add link for the security level you wish to assign users to.</li>
<li value="9" class="calibre9">Select the option you wish to assign to the security level.</li>
<li value="10" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to assign the users.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the following screenshot, we have two security levels defined, Internal Only and Public. So when an issue is set to have the Internal Only security level, only members of the demo-project-members group will be able to view the issue; anyone else will get a security error. When an issue is set to the Public security level, then anyone in Jira will be able to view the issue, provided they also meet the project level permissions set in the permission scheme used by the project:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Troubleshooting permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Getting permission settings right is very critical to secure data for your organization, especially for projects containing sensitive information that require very restricted permission control. And with the different levels of permission controls in Jira, it can be frustrating and confusing to figure out why a user cannot access an issue he or she is expected to have access to.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To help with this, Jira provides a permission helper to assist administrators with pinpointing settings that prevent users from accessing certain features. To use the permission helper:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the System tab and then the Permission helper option at the bottom.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Specify the user that is having access problems in the User field.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Specify the issue to test with.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Select the permission the user does not have (for example, Edit Issues).</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on Submit:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone86" src="img/00096.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the preceding screenshot, the user Patrick Li cannot edit issue DEMO-3 because he is not in the Internal Only issue security level, which is required as per the <strong class="calibre1">Default Permission Scheme</strong> used.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Managing Jira notifications</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As your team starts to use Jira to run their projects day to day, each member would need to be notified when changes happen to the tasks they are working on, such as a quality assurance officer rejecting a bug fix submitted by an engineer, or a comment logged by the product owner on a new feature. This is especially important for distributed teams in different time zones, where simply walking up to someone for a quick chat is not an option. To help with collaboration within the team, Jira uses email notifications to keep everyone up to date on changes that happen to issues in the project, and it has a very flexible way to allow you to define how and when these notifications should be sent out.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Enabling outgoing emails</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In order for Jira to send out outgoing email notifications, you need to be a Jira system administrator (for example, the user created during the initial setup is a system administrator) to configure mail server details. Perform the following steps to manage the outgoing mail server:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the System tab and then the Outgoing Mail option. This will bring up the Outgoing Mail page:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone87" src="img/00097.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="3" class="calibre14">
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click on the Configure new SMTP mail server button.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="4" class="calibre14">
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Enter the general details of your mail server, including the name, description, from address, and email prefix.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Select the type of mail server from the Service Provider field.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Enter the mail server's connection details.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre9">Click on the Test Connection button to verify configuration.</li>
<li value="8" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to register to the mail server:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone88" src="img/00098.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have set up the SMTP mail server for your Jira instance, you will be able to send test emails to verify connectivity, which will be very useful during troubleshooting situations, as we will see later in this chapter. You can also disable all outgoing email notifications with the Disable Outgoing Mail button, a useful option if you want to temporarily disable all email notifications while you perform other maintenance tasks.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Configuring notification schemes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">With the SMTP mail server setup, the next step is to configure rules for the following questions:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">When should Jira send out email notifications?</li>
<li class="calibre9">Who should receive these email notifications?</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Jira uses <strong class="calibre1">notification schemes</strong> to control the preceding two questions. In Jira, each user action, such as editing an issue, can trigger an event, and for each event, you can define a list of users that will receive notifications. This event to notification mapping is what makes up a notification scheme. Once you have defined your notification scheme, you can then apply the scheme to various projects. This way, each project can have its own unique notification settings, and multiple projects can share the same notification settings. To configure a notification scheme, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the Issues tab and then the Notification schemes option. This will bring up the Notification Schemes page. By default, there is only one notification scheme, called Default Notification Scheme, and all projects make use of it. You can choose to edit the default scheme by clicking on its Notifications link, which will affect all projects, or create a new scheme by clicking the Add notification scheme button.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Once you have the notification scheme ready, Jira will display the list of events available, and users (if any) that will receive notifications, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone89" src="img/00099.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre14">
<li value="4" class="calibre9">You can add new users to receive notifications by clicking the Add link for an event you want. Jira will then show you a list of all the options you can use to define the notification recipients. As you can see in the following screenshot, there are many options, ranging from static options, such as specific users in Jira or exact email addresses, to more dynamic options, such as all users in a group or in a custom field of the issue.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Select the notification recipient option and click Add. You can repeat the process to add more users to receive notifications for the event:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone90" src="img/00100.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Troubleshooting notifications</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Often, as an administrator, when people do not receive expected notifications from Jira, it can be difficult and frustrating to find the cause. There are two common causes for notification-related problems: outgoing mail server connectivity, or misconfiguration of the notification scheme.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Troubleshooting outgoing mail server problems is quite simple. All you need to do is try to send out a test email from the Send a Test Email option from the Outgoing Mail administration section. If you receive your test email, then there will be no problems with your outgoing mail server configuration, and you can focus on your notification configurations. As shown in the following screenshot, the test email delivery has failed, and the error is because Jira was unable to connect to the configured SMTP server:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone91" src="img/00101.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Troubleshooting notification settings is not as straightforward, since there are a number of things that you will need to consider. To help with this challenge, Jira has a new feature, called Notification helper. The notification helper can save the Jira administrators time by helping them to pinpoint why a given user does or does not receive notifications. All the administrator has to do is tell the helper who the user is, which issue (or an example issue from the target project) the user should be receiving notifications for, and the event that is triggering the notification:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the System tab and then the Notification helper option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Specify the user that should receive notifications in the User field.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Specify the issue to test with.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Select the type of notification event.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on Submit.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Notification helper will then process the input and report if the user is expected to receiving be notifications and why, based on notification scheme settings:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone92" src="img/00102.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As you can see from the preceding screenshot, the user Patrick Li is currently not receiving notifications for the DEMO-2 issue when it is updated because the notification is set up to have only the Current Assignee receive emails, and Patrick Li is not the assignee.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we looked at how to customize Jira beyond the default templates provided by its agile templates. We looked at how to create new issue types and custom fields, as well as authoring workflows with custom permission and validations. We also introduced Jira's permission hierarchy and the options you have to secure your system against unauthorized access. Lastly, we looked at how to manage email notifications in Jira, so team members can stay up to date on changes that happen in their projects.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we will look at some advanced topics, such as integrating Jira with other tools to go beyond what it can do with out-of-the box features.</p>
