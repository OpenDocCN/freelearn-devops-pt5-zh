    easy. Buy a server, install WebLogic (or whichever other monster application server
    you're using) and deploy your applications. Then wait for a few weeks until you
    discover that everything is so fast that you can click a button, have some coffee,
    and, by the time you get back to your desk, the result will be waiting for you.
    What do you do? You scale. You buy few more servers, install your monster applications
    servers and deploy your monster applications on top of them. Which part of the
    system was the bottleneck? Nobody knows. Why did you duplicate everything? Because
    you must. And then some more time passes, and you continue scaling until you run
    out of money and, simultaneously, people working for you go crazy. Today we do
    not approach scaling like that. Today we understand that scaling is about many
    other things. It's about elasticity. It's about being able to quickly and easily
    scale and de-scale depending on variations in your traffic and growth of your
    business, and that, during that process, you should not go bankrupt. It's about
    the need of almost every company to scale their business without thinking that
    IT department is a liability. It's about getting rid of those monsters.

    The main reason is *high availability*. Why do we want high availability? We want
    it because we want our business to be available under any load. The bigger the
    load, the better (unless you are under DDoS). It means that our business is booming.
    With high availability our users are happy. We all want speed, and many of us
    simply leave the site if it takes too long to load. We want to avoid having outages
    because every minute our business is not operational can be translated into a
    money loss. What would you do if an online store is not available? Probably go
    to another. Maybe not the first time, maybe not the second, but, sooner or later,
    you would get fed up and switch it for another. We are used to everything being
    fast and responsive, and there are so many alternatives that we do not think twice
    before trying something else. And if that something else turns up to be better...
    One man's loss is another man's gain. Do we solve all our problems with scalability?
    Not even close. Many other factors decide the availability of our applications.
    However, scalability is an important part of it, and it happens to be the subject
    of this chapter.

    on. Things are still relatively simple. We are faced with new challenges, but
    obstacles can be overcome in time. Even though the complexity is increasing, we
    can still handle it with relative ease. In other words, what we're doing is still
    more or less the same but bigger. Business is doing well, but it is still relatively

    Maybe that last feature was indeed a killer one. No matter the reasons, business
    got a big boost. After a short period of happiness due to this change, your pain
    increases tenfold. Adding more databases does not seem to be enough. Multiplying
    application servers does not appear to fulfill the needs. You start adding caching
    and what so not. You start getting the feeling that every time you multiply something,
    benefits are not equally big. Costs increase, and you are still not able to meet
    the demand. Database replications are too slow. New application servers do not
    make such a big difference anymore. Operational costs are increasing faster than
    you expected. The situation hurts the business and the team. You are starting
    to realize that the architecture you were so proud of cannot fulfill this increase
    in load. You can not split it. You cannot scale things that hurt the most. You
    cannot start over. All you can do is continue multiplying with ever decreasing
    benefits of such actions.

    is not necessarily right when the demand increases. We need to balance the need
    for **You ain't going to need it** (**YAGNI**) principle and the longer term vision.
    We cannot start with the system optimized for large companies because it is too
    expensive and does not provide enough benefits when business is small. On the
    other hand, we cannot lose the focus from one of the main objectives of any business.
    We cannot not think about scaling from the very first day. Designing scalable
    architecture does not mean that we need to start with a cluster of a hundred servers.
    It does not mean that we have to develop something big and complex from the start.
    It means that we should start small, but in the way that, when it becomes big,
    it is easy to scale. While microservices are not the only way to accomplish that
    goal, they are indeed a good way to approach this problem. The cost is not in
    development but operations. If operations are automated, that cost can be absorbed
    quickly and does not need to represent a massive investment. As you already saw
    (and will continue seeing throughout the rest of the book), there are excellent
    open source tools at our disposal. The best part of automation is that the investment
    tends to have lower maintenance cost than when things are done manually.

    of an application or a service. In most cases, there is a load balancer on top
    that makes sure that the traffic is shared among all those instances. The biggest
    advantage of x-axis scaling is simplicity. All we have to do is deploy the same
    application on multiple servers. For that reason, this is the most commonly used
    type of scaling. However, it comes with its set of disadvantages when applied
    to monolithic applications. Having a huge application usually requires big cache
    that demands heavy usage of memory. When such an application is multiplied, everything
    is multiplied by it, including the cache.

    Performance problems are almost never related to the whole application. Not all
    modules are equally affected, and, yet, we multiply everything. That means that
    even though we could be better of by scaling only part of the application that
    require such an action, we scale everything. Never the less, x-scaling is important
    no matter the architecture. The major difference is the effect that such a scaling
    has. By using microservices, we are not removing the need for x-axis scaling but
    making sure that due to their architecture such scaling has more effect than with
    alternative and more traditional approaches to architecture. With microservices
    we have the option to fine-tune scaling. We can have many instances of services
    that suffer a lot under heavy load and only a few instances of those that are
    used less often or require fewer resources. On top of that, since they are small,
    we might never reach a limit of a service. A small service in a big server would
    need to receive a truly massive amount of traffic before the need for scaling
    arises. Scaling microservices is more often related to fault tolerance than performance
    problems. We want to have multiple copies running so that, if one of them dies,
    the others can take over until recovery is performed:'

    Even though there are different ways to accomplish this decomposition, microservices
    are probably the best approach we can take. When they are combined with immutability
    and self-sufficiency, there is indeed no better alternative (at least from the
    prism of y-axis scaling). Unlike x-axis scaling, the y-axis is not accomplished
    by running multiple instances of the same application but by having multiple different
    services distributed across the cluster.

    most common usage is among databases. The idea behind this type of scaling is
    to distribute data among multiple servers thus reducing the amount of work that
    each of them needs to perform. Data is partitioned and distributed so that each
    server needs to deal only with a subset of the data. This type of the separation
    is often called sharding, and there are many databases specially designed for
    this purpose. Benefits of z-axis scaling are most noticeable in I/O and cache
    and memory utilization.

    servers and start thinking of a cluster; of all servers as one big entity. That
    can be better explained if we drop to a bit lower level. When we deploy an application,
    we tend to specify how much memory or CPU it might need. However, we do not decide
    which memory slots our application will use nor which CPUs it should utilize.
    For example, we don't specify that some application should use CPUs 4, 5 and 7\.
    That would be inefficient and potentially dangerous. We only decide that three
    CPUs are required. The same approach should be taken on a higher level. We should
    not care where an application or a service will be deployed but what it needs.
    We should be able to define that the service has certain requirements and tell
    some tool to deploy it to whichever server in our cluster, as long as it fulfills
    the needs we have. The best (if not the only) way to accomplish that is to consider
    the whole cluster as one entity. We can increase or decrease the capacity of that
    cluster by adding or removing servers but, no matter what we do, it should still
    be a single entity. We define a strategy and let our services be deployed somewhere
    inside the cluster. Those using cloud providers like **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**),

    4、5和7。这样做既低效又可能危险。我们只决定需要多少CPU。我们应该在更高的层次上采取相同的做法。我们不应该关心应用程序或服务将部署到哪里，而是关心它需要什么。我们应该能够定义该服务的具体需求，并告诉某个工具将它部署到集群中的任何服务器，只要它满足我们的需求。实现这一目标的最佳方法（如果不是唯一的方法）就是将整个集群视为一个整体。我们可以通过增加或移除服务器来增加或减少集群的容量，但无论我们做什么，集群仍然应该是一个单一的整体。我们定义一个策略，并让我们的服务在集群内的某个地方部署。像**Amazon

    containers. It is, in a way, a replica of what Google has been doing for a long
    time but, this time, adapted to Docker. That approach is great in many ways, most
    important being that they used their experience from the start. If you started
    using Kubernetes around Docker version 1.0 (or earlier), the experience with Kubernetes
    was great. It solved many of the problems that Docker itself had. We can mount
    persistent volumes that allow us to move containers without losing data, it uses
    flannel to create networking between containers, it has load balancer integrated,
    it uses etcd for service discovery, and so on. However, Kubernetes comes at a
    cost. When compared with Docker, it uses a different CLI, different API, and different
    YAML definitions. In other words, you cannot use Docker CLI, nor you can use Docker
    Compose to define containers. Everything needs to be done from scratch exclusively
    for Kubernetes. It's as if the tool was not written for Docker (which is partly
    true). Kubernetes brought clustering to a new level but at the expense of usability

    advantage and a disadvantage at the same time. Being able to use familiar tools
    of your choosing is great but for the same reasons we are bound by the limitations
    of Docker API. If the Docker API doesn't support something, there is no way around

    do is install one of the service discovery tools and run the `swarm` container
    on all nodes. Since the distribution itself is packed in a Docker container, it
    works in the same way no matter the operating system. We run the `swarm` container,
    expose a port and inform it about the address of the service discovery. It could
    hardly be easier than that. We can even start using it without any service discovery
    tool, see whether we like it and when our usage of it becomes more serious, add
    etcd, Consul or some of the other supported tools.

    differ from OS to OS and provider to provider. Each OS or a hosting provider comes
    with its set of instructions, each of them having a separate maintenance team
    with a different set of problems. As an example, if you choose to try it out with
    Vagrant, you are stuck with Fedora. That does not mean that you cannot run it
    with Vagrant and, let's say, Ubuntu or CoreOS. You can, but you need to start
    searching for instructions outside the official Kubernetes Getting Started page.
    Whatever your needs are, it's likely that the community has the solution, but
    you still need to spend some time searching for it and hoping that it works from
    the first attempt. The bigger problem is that the installation relies on a bash
    script. That would not be a big deal in itself if we would not live in the era
    where configuration management is a must. We might not want to run a script but
    make Kubernetes be part of our Puppet, Chef, or Ansible definitions. Again, this
    can be overcome as well. You can find Ansible playbooks for running Kubernetes,
    or you can write your own. None of those issues are a big problem but, when compared
    with Swarm, they are a bit painful. With Docker, we were supposed not to have
    installation instructions (aside from a few `docker run` arguments). We were supposed
    to run containers. Swarm fulfills that promise, and Kubernetes doesn't.

    Swarm, Kubernetes is an opinionated tool. You need to live with the choices it
    made for you. If you want to use Kubernetes, you have to use etcd. I'm not trying
    to say that etcd is bad (quite contrary), but if you prefer, for example, to use
    Consul, you're in a very complicated situation and would need to use one for Kubernetes
    and the other for the rest of your service discovery needs. Another thing I dislike
    about Kubernetes is its need to know things in advance, before the setup. You
    need to tell it the addresses of all your nodes, which role each of them has,
    how many minions there are in the cluster and so on. With Swarm, we just bring
    up a node and tell it to join the network. Nothing needs to be set in advance

    Swarm? You don't! Actually, you do, but not in any form or way different from
    the way you were defining them before Swarm. If you are used to running containers
    through Docker CLI, you can keep using it with (almost) the same commands. If
    you prefer to use Docker Compose to run containers, you can continue using it
    to run them inside the Swarm cluster. Whichever way you've used to run your containers,
    the chances are that you can continue doing the same with Swarm but on a much
    larger scale.

    you are already familiar with Docker. You are probably already used to Docker
    Compose as a way to define arguments for the containers you'll run. If you played
    with it for more than a few hours, you are using it as a substitute for Docker
    CLI. You run containers with it, tail their logs, scale them, and so on. On the
    other hand, you might be a hard-core Docker user who does not like Docker Compose
    and prefers running everything through Docker CLI or you might have your bash
    scripts that run containers for you. No matter what you choose, it should work
    with Docker Swarm.

    You have to use them one way or another. Once you start using Kubernetes you will
    discover that all your Docker Compose definitions (or whatever else you might
    be using) need to be translated to Kubernetes way of describing things and, from
    there on, you will have to maintain both. With Kubernetes, everything will have
    to be duplicated resulting in higher cost of maintenance. And it's not only about
    duplicated configurations. Commands you'll run outside the cluster will be different
    from those inside the cluster. All those Docker commands you learned and love
    will have to get their Kubernetes equivalents inside the cluster.

- en: Guys behind Kubernetes are not trying to make your life miserable by forcing
    you to do things "their way". The reason for such a big differences is in different
    approaches Swarm and Kubernetes are using to tackle the same problem. Swarm team
    decided to match their API with the one from Docker. As a result, we have (almost)
    full compatibility. Almost everything we can do with Docker we can do with Swarm
    as well only on a much larger scale. There's nothing new to do, no configurations
    to be duplicated and nothing new to learn. No matter whether you use Docker CLI
    directly or go through Swarm, API is (more or less) the same. The negative side
    of that story is that if there is something you'd like Swarm to do and that something
    is not part of the Docker API, you're in for a disappointment. Let us simplify
    this a bit. If you're looking for a tool for deploying containers in a cluster
    that will use Docker API, Swarm is the solution. On the other hand, if you want
    a tool that will overcome Docker limitations, you should go with Kubernetes. It
    is power (Kubernetes) against simplicity (Swarm). Or, at least, that's how it
    was until recently. But, I'm jumping ahead of myself.

    ones were networking, persistent volumes and automatic failover in case one or
    more containers or a whole node stopped working.
  id: totrans-65

- en: Until Docker Swarm release 1.0 we could not link containers running on different
    servers. We still cannot link them, but now we have `multi-host networking` to
    help us connect containers running on different servers. It is a very powerful
    feature. Kubernetes used `flannel` to accomplish networking and now, since the
    Docker release 1.9, that feature is available as part of Docker CLI.
  id: totrans-66
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another problem was persistent volumes. Docker introduced them in release 1.9\.
    Until recently, if you persist a volume, that container was tied to the server
    that volume resides. It could not be moved around without, again, resorting to
    some nasty tricks like copying volume directory from one server to another. That
    in itself is a slow operation that defies the goals of the tools like Swarm. Besides,
    even if you have time to copy a volume from one to the other server, you do not
    know where to copy since clustering tools tend to treat your whole datacenter
    as a single entity. Your containers will be deployed to a location most suitable
    for them (least number of containers running, most CPUs or memory available, and
    so on). Now we have persistent volumes supported by Docker natively.
  id: totrans-67
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, automatic failover is probably the only feature advantage Kubernetes
    has over Swarm. However, failover solution provided by Kuberentes is incomplete.
    If a container goes down, Kubernetes will detect that and start it again on a
    healthy node. The problem is that containers or whole nodes often do not fail
    for no reason. Much more needs to be done than a simple re-deployment. Someone
    needs to be notified, information before a failure needs to be evaluated, and
    so on. If re-deployment is all you need, Kubernetes is a good solution. If more
    is needed, Swarm, due to its "batteries included but removable" philosophy, allows
    you to build your solution. Regarding the failover, it's a question whether to
    aim for an out-of-the-box solution (Kubernetes) that is hard to extend or go for
    a solution that is built with the intention to be easily extended (Swarm).

    by Kubernetes for quite some time and the reason many were choosing it over Swarm.
    That advantage disappeared with Docker release 1.9\. Automatic fail-over remains
    an advantage Kubernetes has over Swarm when looking at out-of-the-box solutions.
    In the case of Swarm, we need to develop failover strategies ourselves.

    terms. Do you want to depend on Docker solving problems related to clustering.
    If you do, choose Swarm. If Docker does not support something, it will be unlikely
    that it will be supported by Swarm since it relies on Docker API. On the other
    hand, if you want a tool that works around Docker limitations, Kubernetes might
    be the right one for you. Kubernetes was not built around Docker but is based
    on Google's experience with containers. It is opinionated and tries to do things
    in its own way.
  id: totrans-71

- en: The real question is whether Kubernetes' way of doing things, which is quite
    different from how we use Docker, is overshadowed by advantages it gives. Or,
    should we place our bets into Docker itself and hope that it will solve those
    problems? Before you answer those questions, take a look at the Docker release
    1.9\. We got persistent volumes and software networking. We also got `unless-stopped`
    restart policy that will manage our unwanted failures. Now, there are three things
    less of a difference between Kubernetes and Swarm. Actually, these days there
    are very few advantages Kubernetes has over Swarm. Automatic failover featured
    by Kubernetes is a blessing and a curse at the same time. On the other hand, Swarm
    uses Docker API meaning that you get to keep all your commands and Docker Compose
    configurations. Personally, I'm placing my bets on Docker engine getting improvements
    and Docker Swarm running on top of it. The difference between the two is small.
    Both are production ready but Swarm is easier to set up, easier to use and we
    get to keep everything we built before moving to the cluster; there is no duplication
    between cluster and non-cluster configurations.
  id: totrans-72

- en: My recommendation is to go with Docker Swarm. Kubernetes is too opinionated,
    hard to set up, too different from Docker CLI/API and at the same time, besides
    automatic failover, it doesn't have real advantages over Swarm since the Docker
    release 1.9\. That doesn't mean that there are no features available in Kubernetes
    that are not supported by Swarm. There are feature differences in both directions.
    However, those differences are, in my opinion, not significant ones and the gap
    is getting smaller with each Docker release. Actually, for many use cases, there
    is no gap at all while Docker Swarm is easier to set up, learn and use.

    it could be `swarm-node-1`. We did not make the decision where to deploy the containers.
    Swarm did that for us. Since we are using the default strategy that, without specifying
    additional constraints, runs containers on a server that has the least number
    of them running. Since both `swarm-node-1` and `swarm-node-2` were equally empty
    (or full), Swarm had an easy choice and could have placed containers on either
    one of those servers. In this case, it chose `swarm-node-2`.

- en: The problem with the deployment we just performed is that the two targets (`app`
    and `db`) are linked. In such a case, Docker has no other option but to place
    both containers on the same server. That, in a way, defies the objective we're
    trying to accomplish. We want to deploy containers to the cluster and, as you'll
    soon discover, be able to scale them easily. If both containers need to be run
    on the same server, we are limiting Swarm's ability to distribute them properly.
    In this example, those two containers would be better of running on separate servers.
    If, before deploying those containers, both servers had the equal number of containers
    running, it would make more sense to run the `app` on one and the `db` on the
    other. That way we'd distribute resource usage much better. As it is now, the
    `swarm-node-2` needs to do all the work, and the `swarm-node-1` is empty. The
    first thing we should do is to get rid of the link.

    It is, without a doubt, the most significant release, since version 1.0\. It gave
    us two long awaited features; multi-host networking and persistent volumes. Networking
    makes linking deprecated and is the feature we need to connect containers across
    multiple hosts. There is no more need for proxy services to connect containers
    internally. That is not to say that proxy is not useful, but that we should use
    a proxy as a public interface towards our services and networking for connecting
    containers that form a logical group. The new Docker networking and proxy services
    have different advantages and should be used for different use cases. Proxy services
    provide load balancing and can control the access to our services. Docker networking
    is a convenient way to connect separate containers that form a single service
    and reside on the same network. A typical use case for Docker networking would
    be a service that requires a connection to a database. We can connect those two
    through networking. Furthermore, the service itself might need to be scaled and
    have multiple instances running. A proxy service with load balancer should fulfill
    that requirement. Finally, other services might need to access this service. Since
    we want to take advantage of load balancing, that access should also be through
    a proxy:'

    two instances running on `nodes-01` and `nodes-03`. All communication to those
    services is performed through a proxy service that takes care of load balancing
    and security. Any service (be it external or internal) that wants to access our
    service needs to go through the proxy. Internally, the service uses the database.
    The communication between the service instances and the database is internal and
    performed through the multi-host network. This setting allows us to scale easily
    within the cluster while keeping internal all communication between containers
    that compose a single service. In other words, all communication between containers
    that compose a single service is done through networking while the communication
    between services is performed through the proxy.

    node. This time, we are using two Ansible playbooks to provision the cluster.
    The `swarmPlaybook` variable holds the name of the playbook that configures the
    whole `Swarm` cluster while the `proxyPlaybook` variable references the playbook
    in charge of setting up the `nginx` proxy on the `swarm-master` node. In real
    world situations, Swarm master and the proxy service should be separated but,
    in this case, I opted against an additional VM to save a bit of resources on your
    laptop. Finally, the `instances` variable with the default value of `1` is added
    to the script. We'll explore its usage shortly.

    addition is the creation of a Docker network. Since it can be created only once,
    and all subsequent attempts will result in an error, the `sh` command is enclosed
    inside a `try/catch` block that will prevent the script from failing.
  id: totrans-284
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The creation of the network is followed by deployment of the `db` and `app`
    targets. Unlike DB that, in this scenario, is always deployed as a single instance,
    the `app` target might need to be scaled. For that reason, the first one is deployed
    through the `up` and the other through the `scale` command available through Docker
    Compose. The `scale` command utilizes the `instances` variable to determine how
    many copies of the release should be deployed. We can increase or decrease their
    number simply by changing the `instances` variable in the Jenkinsfile. Once such
    a change is committed to the repository, Jenkins will run a new build and deploy
    as many instances as we specified.
