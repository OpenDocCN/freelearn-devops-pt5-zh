  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To organize content in Confluence we use spaces, which come in two types. A
    space is an area within Confluence, containing your pages. Spaces can be thought
    of as a subsites or a containers, with their own page structure and home page.
  prefs: []

    you may want to separate areas based on team, department, or topic.'

    be kept private or open, for every user to see and edit. Personal spaces can be
    used for personal information such as blog posts, bookmarks, and attachments.
    Administrators can choose to disable personal spaces altogether.'

    every space, provided you have the permissions to do so. Blog posts are generally
    used for announcements, journal entries, reports, or any other time sensitive
    information. Blog posts are sometimes also referred to as news.

    an existing page or blog post, but are not necessarily part of the content of
    the page. Comments can be used to interact with other users on a topic. Comments
    can be added to every page or blog post, provided the user has permission to do
    so.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Comments are displayed at the bottom of the page, below the content, ordered
    in such a manner that the newest comment is at the bottom. Comments are normally
    displayed as a thread, showing hierarchy and context in the responses. Administrators
    can change the settings and choose to display all comments in a single flat list,
    removing the hierarchy and context.

    two or more columns. Some layouts also provide a horizontal header and footer
    to the page. The layout you select determines the position of the columns and
    the relative width of those columns on the page. If you use a page layout, the
    content of the page is confined within the border of that layout and it is not
    possible to add content before or after.

    Verify that all the headings are correct and that there is no Word Art (as Confluence
    doesn't support this) in your document. Make sure the images in your document
    are at 100 percent magnification; this will make sure Confluence imports the images
    in their full size.
