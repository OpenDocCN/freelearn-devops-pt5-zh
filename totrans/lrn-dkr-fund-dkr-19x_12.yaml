    into a single binary or a few very tightly coupled binaries that need to be co-located

    smaller subproblems that are more manageable. As an example, it would be insanely
    complex to build a house in one single step. It is much easier to build the house
    from simple parts that are then combined into the final result.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The same also applies to software development. It is much easier to develop
    a very complex application if we divide this application into smaller components
    that interoperate and make up the overall application. Now, it is much easier
    to develop these components individually if they are only loosely coupled to each
    other. What this means is that component A makes no assumptions about the inner
    workings of, say, components B and C, and is only interested in how it can communicate
    with those two components across a well-defined interface.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If each component has a well-defined and simple public interface through which
    communication with the other components in the system and the outside world happens,
    then this enables us to develop each component individually, without implicit
    dependencies to other components. During the development process, other components
    in the system can easily be replaced by stubs or mocks to allow us to test our
    components.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Every meaningful business application creates, modifies, or uses data. In IT,
    a synonym for data is *state*. An application service that creates or modifies
    persistent data is called a stateful component. Typical stateful components are
    database services or services that create files. On the other hand, application
    components that do not create or modify persistent data are called stateless components.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In a distributed application architecture, stateless components are much simpler
    to handle than stateful components. Stateless components can be easily scaled
    up and down. Furthermore, they can be quickly and painlessly torn down and restarted
    on a completely different node of the cluster – all of this because they have
    no persistent data associated with them.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Given that fact, it is helpful to design a system in a way that most of the
    application services are stateless. It is best to push all the stateful components
    to the boundary of the application and limit their number. Managing stateful components
    is hard.

    that you need to know on which node the target component is running and on which
    port it is listening for communication. Most often, nodes are identified by an
    IP address and a port, which is just a number in a well-defined range.

    runs on one or only a few well-known and curated servers, it totally falls apart
    in a distributed application architecture. First of all, in this scenario, we
    have many components, and keeping track of them manually becomes a nightmare.
    This is definitely not scalable. Furthermore, **Service A** typically should or
    will never know on which node of the cluster the other components run. Their location
    may not even be stable as component B could be moved from node X to another node
    Y, due to various reasons external to the application. Thus, we need another way
    in which **Service A** can locate **Service B**, or any other service, for that
    matter. What is most commonly used is an external authority that is aware of the
    topology of the system at any given time.

    with **Service B**, but it can't do this directly. First, it has to query the external authority,
    a registry service (here, called a **DNS Service**), about the whereabouts of
    **Service B**. The registry service will answer with the requested information
    and hand out the IP address and port number that **Service A** can use to reach
    **Service B**. **Service** **A** then uses this information and establishes a
    communication with **Service B**. Of course, this is a naive picture of what's
    really happening on a low level, but it is a good picture to help us understand
    the architectural pattern of service discovery.

    OSI model (see the reference to this in the *Further reading* section of this
    chapter for more information) is used to distinguish between different types of
    routing. In the context of containers and container orchestration, routing at
    layers 2, 3, 4, and 7 is relevant. We will dive into more detail about routing
    in subsequent chapters. Here, let's just say that layer 2 routing is the most
    low-level type of routing, which connects a MAC address to another MAC address,
    while layer 7 routing, which is also called application-level routing, is the
    most high-level one. The latter is, for example, used to route requests that have
    a target identifier, that is, a URL such as [https://acme.com/pets](https://acme.com/pets),

    amount of workload assigned to it. This task is a generic one, which means that we
    don't want the caller to have to do the load balancing, but rather an external
    service that intercepts the call and takes over the part of deciding which of
    the target service instances to forward the call to. This external service is
    called a load balancer. Load balancers can use different algorithms to decide
    how to distribute incoming calls to target service instances. The most common
    algorithm that's used is called round-robin. This algorithm just assigns requests
    in a repetitive way, starting with instance 1, then 2, until instance n. After
    the last instance has been served, the load balancer starts over with instance
    number 1.

    such as credit card validation services or stock information services, to just
    name two. All these other services are external to the service we are developing.
    We have no control over their correctness or their availability at any given time.

    the worst means that we have to deal with potential failures explicitly.

    or not responsive enough, then the following procedure can be used. When the call
    to the other service fails or times out, the calling code should be structured
    in such a way that the same call is repeated after a short wait time. If the call
    fails again, the wait should be a bit longer before the next trial. The calls
    should be repeated up until a maximum number of times, each time increasing the
    wait time. After that, the service should give up and provide a degraded service,
    which could mean returning some stale cached data or no data at all, depending
    on the situation.

    an individual node of the cluster. Aggregated logs are easy to parse and filter

    is dependent on other services. As developers, we should always expect the worst
    and have appropriate error handling in place. One of the most important best practices
    is to fail fast. Code the service in such a way that unrecoverable errors are
    discovered as early as possible and, if such an error is detected, have the service
    fail immediately. But don't forget to log meaningful information to `STDERR` or
    `STDOUT`, which can be used by developers or system operators later to track malfunctions
    of the system. Also, return a helpful error to the caller, indicating as precisely
    as possible why the call failed.

    365 days a year. Downtime is not acceptable since it might result in a huge loss
    of opportunities or reputation for the company. In a highly distributed application,
    the likelihood of a failure of at least one of the many involved components is
    non-neglectable. We can say that the question is not whether a component will
    fail, but rather when a failure will occur.
  prefs: []

    individual part of the system needs to be redundant. This includes the application
    components, as well as all infrastructure parts. What that means is that if we,
    say, have a payment service as part of our application, then we need to run this
    service redundantly. The easiest way to do that is to run multiple instances of
    this very service on different nodes of our cluster. The same applies, say, for
    an edge router or a load balancer. We cannot afford for this to ever go down.
    Thus, the router or load balancer must be redundant.

    single component of the system redundantly. Proxy services then load balance the
    traffic across the individual instances of a service.

    a certain service instance is available? It could have crashed or it could be
    unresponsive. To solve this problem, we can use so-called health checks. The proxy,
    or some other system service on behalf of the proxy, periodically polls all the
    service instances and checks their health. The questions are basically, Are you
    still there? Are you healthy? The answer to each service is either Yes or No,
    or the health check times out if the instance is not responsive anymore.
  prefs: []

    in place.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    can also be turned around. The components could be required to periodically send

    malfunctioning? The solution to this problem is that the application produces
    abundant and meaningful logging information while running. Developers need to
    instrument their application services in such a way that they output helpful information,
    such as when an error happens or a potentially unexpected or unwanted situation
    is encountered. Often, this information is output to `STDOUT` and `STDERR`, where
    it is then collected by system daemons that write the information to local files
    or forward it to a central log aggregation service.

    is even more important than in a monolithic application. The paths of execution
    of a single request through all the components of the application can be very
    complex. Also, remember that the components are distributed across a cluster of
    nodes. Thus, it makes sense to log everything of importance, and to add things
    to each log entry such as the exact time when it happened, the component in which
    it happened, and the node on which the component ran, to name just a few. Furthermore,
    the logging information should be aggregated in a central location so that it

- en: One way of updating an application or an application service is to use rolling
    updates. The assumption here is that the particular piece of software that has
    to be updated runs in multiple instances. Only then can we use this type of update.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What happens is that the system stops one instance of the current service and
    replaces it with an instance of the new service. As soon as the new instance is
    ready, it will be served traffic. Usually, the new instance is monitored for some
    time to see whether or not it works as expected and, if it does, the next instance
    of the current service is taken down and replaced with a new instance. This pattern
    is repeated until all the service instances have been replaced.

    new, the application is operational all the time. No downtime is needed.

- en: In blue-green deployments, the current version of the application service, called **blue**,
    handles all the application traffic. We then install the new version of the application
    service, called **green**, on the production system. The new service is not wired
    with the rest of the application yet.

- en: 'Once **green** is installed, we can execute **smoke tests** against this new
    service and, if those succeed, the router can be configured to funnel all traffic
    that previously went to **blue** to the new service, **green**. The behavior of
    **green** is then observed closely and, if all success criteria are met, **blue**
    can be decommissioned. But if, for some reason, **green** shows some unexpected
    or unwanted behavior, the router can be reconfigured to return all traffic to
    blue. Green can then be removed and fixed, and a new blue-green deployment can
    be executed with the corrected version:'

- en: Canary releases are releases where we have the current version of the application
    service and the new version installed on the system in parallel. As such, they
    resemble blue-green deployments. At first, all traffic is still routed through
    the current version. We then configure a router so that it funnels a small percentage,
    say 1%, of the overall traffic to the new version of the application service.
    Subsequently, the behavior of the new service is monitored closely to find out
    whether it works as expected. If all the criteria for success are met, then the
    router is configured to funnel more traffic, say 5% this time, through the new
    service. Again, the behavior of the new service is closely monitored and, if it
    is successful, more and more traffic is routed to it until we reach 100%. Once
    all the traffic has been routed to the new service and it has been stable for
    some time, the old version of the service can be decommissioned.

    would use canary birds as an early warning system in the mines. Canary birds are
    particularly sensitive to toxic gas and if such a canary bird died, the miners
    knew they had to abandon the mine immediately.

    such as an irreversible schema change in a backing relational database, then we
    need to address this with special care. It is possible to execute such changes
    without downtime if we use the right approach. It is important to recognize that,
    in such a situation, we cannot deploy the code changes that require the new data
    structure in the data store at the same time as the changes to the data. Rather,
    the whole update has to be separated into three distinct steps. In the first step,
    we roll out a backward-compatible schema and data change. If this is successful,
    then we roll out the new code in the second step. Again, if that is successful,
    we clean up the schema in the third step and remove the backward compatibility:'

- en: If we have frequent updates for our application services that run in production,
    sooner or later, there will be a problem with one of those updates. Maybe a developer,
    while fixing a bug, introduced a new one, which was not caught by all the automated,
    and maybe manual, tests, so the application is misbehaving and it is imperative
    that we roll back the service to the previous good version. In this regard, a
    rollback is a recovery from a disaster.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Again, in a distributed application architecture, it is not a question of whether
    a rollback will ever be needed, but rather when a rollback will have to occur.
    Thus, we need to be absolutely sure that we can always roll back to a previous
    version of any service that makes up our application. Rollbacks cannot be an afterthought;
    they have to be a tested and proven part of our deployment process.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we are using blue-green deployments to update our services, then rollbacks
    should be fairly simple. All we need to do is switch the router from the new green
    version of the service back to the previous blue version.
