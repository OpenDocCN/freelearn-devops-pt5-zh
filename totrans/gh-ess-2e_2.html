<p class="calibre3">In the previous chapter, we explored the main page of a repository and we covered the basics of its issue tracker.<br class="calibre7"/></p>
<p class="calibre3">GitHub also provides a wiki-style place to add your project's documentation. You can create as many pages as you like and also grant public access to it so that everyone can edit it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In addition, when you are the creator of a product and have users that rely on it, you will want it to be as stable as possible. Versioning helps to maintain an achievable goal. GitHub provides the right tools to release versions of your code, which in reality are just snapshots in time. Whenever you believe your project is ready to go out into the wild, whether bugs are fixed or new features are added, you can use the releases feature and deliver versioned tarballs to the world.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After finishing this chapter, you will have learned how to create, edit, and maintain a wiki by providing a home for your documentation that will complement your project.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You will also learn how to create a new release out of an existing branch or tag accompanied with optional release notes. This way, the end user can understand the changes from any previous versions.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Using the wiki</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">When you first create a new repository, a wiki attached to this project is also created. It is enabled by default and everyone can add new content or modify existing pages. If you want to change this behavior, you can refer to <a target="_blank" href="part0149.html#4E33Q0-184576c1044a4350bd24f18b869c0732" class="calibre10">Chapter 6</a>, <em class="calibre14">Exploring the User and Repository Settings</em>, which shows you how to accomplish this.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Why wikis are a nice place to document your project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Documentation is not to be taken lightly. To paraphrase a famous quote, with great projects comes great documentation.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Although there are many tools that convert markup files, such as Markdown to HTML, you may not want to use an external page to host your documentation. Enter GitHub wiki.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating a new wiki page</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Select the Wiki tab (the one with the book icon) in order to head over to the wiki. Since our wiki has no content yet, the page doesn't exist. In this case, GitHub prompts you to create the first page. Go ahead and hit the green button.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Every time you add a new page to the wiki, the process is the same. At the top, there is the title. This is the only field that is mandatory in order to create a wiki page, as this is also used to form the URL from which you will have access to the page:</p>
<div><img src="img/00031.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<div><p class="calibre19">When the very first wiki page is created, GitHub uses the title <kbd class="calibre23">Home</kbd> by default. Even if you pick another name, the Home page is created automatically and is used as the front page of your wiki. The name <kbd class="calibre23">Home</kbd> behaves in the same way that <kbd class="calibre23">README</kbd> does for repositories, and it cannot be deleted.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">Below the title area, there are two tabs. When the Write tab is active, you can begin to write in the blank area below. If you choose to write in a markup language, the Preview tab renders the text and shows you how it will be presented when you save the page.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Below the title, there is a nice toolbar that has the most common actions such as headers, bold text, italics, and lists. At the time of writing this book, GitHub supports nine markup languages to choose from. Pick one from the Edit mode drop-down list and the text will be rendered accordingly. For every language you pick from the menu, there is a little help page with the most common actions. Hit the question mark icon to see the help area.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Finally, when you are ready to save the page, you can provide a short message describing what the changes were about. Consider it like a Git commit message. Later, when we explore the page's history, the edit message will come in handy.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Whenever you are ready, press the Save Page button and the page will be created as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/00032.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Deleting a page</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Every page except Home can be deleted. In order to do this, go to the page you want to delete and hit the Edit button at the right corner. As you will see later, deleting a page does not necessarily mean that it is purged forever. Read ahead and learn how to undo things.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">A Markdown-powered wiki – an introduction to Markdown</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">While GitHub supports multiple markup languages, we will explore Markdown as it is the most well-known one.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let's create another page, named <kbd class="calibre13">Installation</kbd>, with some content as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/00033.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">I have used several Markdown elements and hitting Preview will show you how the page will be rendered when it is saved. After you hit the Save Page button, the new Installation page will look like the following:</p>
<div><img src="img/00034.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Some elements worth mentioning are the links. There are two kinds of links: external and internal. External ones are written by giving the full URL including the FQDN, whereas internal links only get called with the page name.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can have external links that display the actual URL by surrounding them with <kbd class="calibre13">&lt;&gt;</kbd>, such as <kbd class="calibre13">&lt;https://duckduckgo.com&gt;</kbd>, and you can also include some random text such as <kbd class="calibre13">[git clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone)</kbd>. Inside the brackets, you can add any text you want, followed by the actual link inside parentheses. Be careful to not leave any spaces between the second bracket and the first parenthesis.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Internal links are useful when you want to link to another page of your wiki. Imagine you have 42 pages and you have to type the whole URL whenever you want to refer to another page. GitHub implements MediaWiki's markup in that case. Use double brackets (<kbd class="calibre13">[[]]</kbd>), and inside them, put the name of the wiki page you want to link to. In our example, I used <kbd class="calibre13">[[Contributing]]</kbd> and this will create a link to another page. Notice that if the link does not exist, it is rendered in red. If you click on it, you will be redirected to create the page.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When creating headers, you use <kbd class="calibre13">#</kbd> before the text. The number of <kbd class="calibre13">#</kbd> defines the header style that will be used. Each header gets a separate anchor link, which you can see if you place your mouse over it on a saved page. This anchor link can then be used to reference internal links.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In our example, you can see that I created three headers, namely  <kbd class="calibre13">Getting started</kbd>, <kbd class="calibre13">Contribute</kbd>, and <kbd class="calibre13">Alternative methods</kbd>. In <kbd class="calibre13">Getting started</kbd>, I placed an interlink with a reference to <kbd class="calibre13">Alternative methods</kbd>. The piece of Markdown that did this is <kbd class="calibre13">[[here|Installation#alternative-methods]]</kbd>. This style introduces two new areas to explore.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Firstly, you can see that an alternate text can be used much like with external links. The only difference is that both the alternate text and the link are placed inside the double brackets separated by a pipe (<kbd class="calibre13">|</kbd>). Secondly, you can see how the call to the internal reference link is made. The page title goes first followed by the octothorp sign (<kbd class="calibre13">#</kbd>) and last is the header. It is important to understand that the header, as part of the interlink, gets transformed, whereas empty spaces are replaced with hyphens (<kbd class="calibre13">-</kbd>) and all special characters (<kbd class="calibre13">?,'!</kbd>, and so on) are lost.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can always use the preview to test whether an anchor link will be rendered correctly.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">Internal links are only supported inside the same wiki. You cannot link to another wiki with an internal link. In this case, you will have to use external links.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">We have only scratched the surface regarding Markdown. You can read more about it in the nice cheat sheet at <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" class="calibre10">https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">How to add a sidebar and a footer to your wiki</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you have write access to a wiki, you should be able to see the Add a custom sidebar and Add a custom footer buttons.</p>
<p class="calibre3">GitHub has a default sidebar where it places all the pages of the wiki. This might not be useful since they are shown in name order and sometimes you want users to be able to access important information without searching too much.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Much like any other wiki page, the sidebar can be written in a markup language that GitHub supports. In the following example, I used <kbd class="calibre13">Markdown</kbd>:</p>
<div><img src="img/00035.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As you can see, I used a bulleted list and placed links on each item. Indenting an item (one or more spaces) will provide the following result:</p>
<div><img src="img/00036.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Like the sidebar, you can also create your own custom footer. For example, I used two external links with custom text, as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00037.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After all modifications, we get a nice wiki page with our custom sidebar and footer:</p>
<div><img src="img/00038.jpeg" class="calibre51"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Watching a wiki page's commit history and reverting to a previous state if needed</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Would you be surprised if you were told that a wiki is essentially a separate Git repository? In the <em class="calibre14">Tips and tricks</em> section, we will see how to clone a wiki locally, make changes, and push back to GitHub.</p>
<p class="calibre3">As with all Git repositories, there are commits and a history log. Each page gets a filtered log of the commits and changes it has undergone. One quick way to access the history log is to click on the revisions link on each page. This can be found under each page title. Take, for example, the Home page which has three revisions:</p>
<div><img src="img/00039.jpeg" class="calibre52"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Another way to view a page's history is by using the Page History button which can be found when you edit a page.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">One other way to see the history log is to append <kbd class="calibre23">/_history</kbd> to your page. So, for example, <a href="https://github.com/axilleas/github-essentials-v2/wiki/Home" class="calibre25">https://github.com/axilleas/github-essentials-v2/wiki/Home</a> becomes <a href="https://github.com/axilleas/github-essentials-v2/wiki/Home/_history" class="calibre25">https://github.com/axilleas/github-essentials-v2/wiki/Home/_history</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">Here is what my Home page log looks like:</p>
<div><img src="img/00040.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">From the preceding screenshot, you can get a lot of useful information. You can see that the username of the person who made the change comes up first in the history table. In this example, there is only mine, but in a wiki with many collaborators, you can easily tell who made what change. Then, you get the commit message which is super useful because you can tell from a glimpse what the change was about. The third column is about the time the change was made and, finally, there is the commit SHA of the change.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now, let's use the power of reverting when things go south. Firstly, create a new page, save it, and then delete it. We cannot go to that specific page's history log since it is no longer there, so we need to head over to the main History page, the mother of all pages. Since this page is hidden, you need to manually append <kbd class="calibre13">/_history</kbd> to your main wiki page.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In order to revert things, you need to use the Compare Revisions button. You can choose between one or two revisions to revert from:</p>
<div><img src="img/00041.jpeg" class="calibre53"/></div>
<p>You can tell the default GitHub commit messages from the custom ones since they follow the pattern <kbd class="calibre23">Created/Updated/Destroyed Title of page (language)</kbd>, where <kbd class="calibre23">language</kbd> is the markup language that was used to create the page.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Here, we chose two, but since they are one after another in the commit history, choosing only the last one would be the same. It's like comparing the changes between <kbd class="calibre13">git show HEAD</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre13">git diff sha2 sha1</kbd>, where <kbd class="calibre13">sha2</kbd> is the last commit <kbd class="calibre13">SHA</kbd> and <kbd class="calibre13">sha1</kbd> is the one before it. The <kbd class="calibre13">diff</kbd> is the same.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After hitting the <kbd class="calibre13">Compare Revisions</kbd> button, we will see the change that was introduced with this commit:</p>
<div><img src="img/00042.jpeg" class="calibre54"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Let's bring back the deleted page by hitting the Revert Changes button. At the time of writing this book, every time I tried to revert the deletion of a page, I was presented with a 500 internal server error. Despite the error, go back to the History page, and you will see that the revert was indeed performed and the deleted page was brought back from the grave:</p>
<div><img src="img/00043.jpeg" class="calibre55"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You can see that the commit message of the revert references the two commits that created and destroyed the page respectively.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">Sometimes, you will not be able to compare any two revisions and revert due to conflict. In this case, GitHub will warn you with a message: This patch was not able to be reversed.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">That's all there is to know about GitHub wikis. Next we will focus on managing code releases with the tools GitHub provides.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Managing code versioning</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In the world of software management, almost every piece of software is shipped with a version. It is a way to declare its evolution over time, usually with the addition of enhancements or bug fixes. GitHub leverages the power of Git and provides a simple interface to ship your versioned software.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating a release</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In GitHub, the notion of a release is tightly tied to Git tags. You can see the existing tags, if any, from the same menu where you change a branch, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00044.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">If you visit the Releases page and there is no tag created yet, you will be prompted to create one. Creating a release will automatically create a tag.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Let's click on the Create a new release button. The following page will appear:</p>
<div><img src="img/00045.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You only need to fill in the name of the Tag version box; everything else is optional. If the tag name you provide already exists, you will be presented with a duplicate tag name notification.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Your tag name can be any arbitrary value, but it is highly recommended to follow the semantic versioning scheme. To briefly describe what semantic versioning is: a release number consists of three numbers separated by dots in the form of <kbd class="calibre13">MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH</kbd>. You should then increment the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="calibre12">The <kbd class="calibre13">MAJOR</kbd> version when you make incompatible API changes</li>
<li class="calibre12">The <kbd class="calibre13">MINOR</kbd> version when you add functionality in a backwards-compatible manner</li>
<li class="calibre12">The <kbd class="calibre13">PATCH</kbd> version when you make backwards-compatible bug fixes</li>
</ul>
<div><p class="calibre19">You can read more at <a href="http://semver.org/" class="calibre25">http://semver.org/</a>.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">One great way to name your tags is to match the existing milestones. From the previous chapter, we already had a <kbd class="calibre13">v0.5</kbd> milestone so let's also name the new tag <kbd class="calibre13">v0.5</kbd>. Start typing it and if the tag does not exist, you will see the Excellent! This tag will be created from the target when you publish this release message.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can choose the target branch or commit from the drop-down menu as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00046.jpeg" class="calibre56"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">If you choose a branch, a tag pointing to the latest commit in that branch will be created. If you instead go to the Recent Commits tab, you can choose from a number of recent commits to create a tag from.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For the sake of our example, let's choose the master branch and enter a release title. Optionally, but recommended, you can add a description of what this release is about. I like to consider the description like writing a blog post of what changed in this release.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You can, of course, use Markdown like almost everywhere in GitHub and use the Preview button to see how it will be rendered:</p>
<div><img src="img/00047.jpeg" class="calibre57"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">If you think everything is in order, hit the Publish release button. You can always edit any release anytime, so do not worry if you miss something. The following screenshot explains all the information about a release:</p>
<div><img src="img/00048.jpeg" class="calibre58"/></div>
<div><p class="calibre19">If a release title is not provided, the tag name will be shown instead. Likewise, if a description is not provided, the latest commit message of the tag will be shown instead.</p>
</div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Editing a release</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In order to edit a release, you can either click on the Edit release button next to the release under the Releases page or visit the particular release and click Edit there.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Pushing a tag from the command line</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Now, let's see how GitHub behaves when a tag already exists. I made a few changes to a file and created a new tag from the command line. Finally, I pushed this tag to GitHub as follows:</p>
<pre class="calibre18">git checkout master<br class="title-page-name"/>echo "0.5.1" &gt; version.txt<br class="title-page-name"/>git add version.txt<br class="title-page-name"/>git commit -m "Release 0.5.1"<br class="title-page-name"/>git push origin master</pre>
<p class="calibre3">If you now visit the tags page, you will see the new tag above the one we made before. In the releases page, click on Draft a new release. We will choose an existing tag, so in the Tag version field, type <kbd class="calibre13">v0.5.1</kbd>. GitHub found out that the tag already exists so it informed us that this is an existing tag:</p>

<p class="calibre3">Give it a title, a brief description, and then publish it. Since the <kbd class="calibre13">v0.5.1</kbd> tag refers to the latest commit rather than the previous release, it now gets marked as Latest release.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Marking as pre-release</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">A nice little decorative feature is that you can mark a release as a prerelease, meaning you can inform the users that it's not ready for production but that they can still download and test it. Let's make a prerelease of the <kbd class="calibre13">develop</kbd> branch, which contains new commits that do not exist in <kbd class="calibre13">master</kbd> yet:</p>
<pre class="calibre18">git checkout master<br class="title-page-name"/>git checkout -b develop<br class="title-page-name"/>echo "0.6rc1" &gt; version.txt<br class="title-page-name"/>git add version.txt<br class="title-page-name"/>git commit -m "0.6 pre-release"<br class="title-page-name"/>git push origin develop</pre>
<p class="calibre3">Create a new release out of the <kbd class="calibre13">develop</kbd> branch and name it <kbd class="calibre13">v0.6rc1</kbd> . This time, mark it as a pre-release by ticking the relevant option:</p>
<div><img src="img/00050.jpeg" class="calibre60"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After publishing it, here is what the releases page will look like:</p>
<div><img src="img/00051.jpeg" class="calibre61"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Making a draft of a release</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you tend to provide a detailed description with each release, you may find the draft feature quite useful. You can repeatedly edit a release while adding the required information and then save it as a draft. This way, you can spend less time on it when you need to publish it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In order to make a draft of a release, do not click Publish release, but rather click the Save draft button. Back on the Releases page, you can see the draft release you just created:</p>
<div><img src="img/00052.jpeg" class="calibre62"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You can edit it as many times as you want, and when the time comes to publish it, just click Public release. To delete a draft, click on the Discard draft button.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since you are working on a draft, you don't have to worry about changing the tag of the release or any other information for that matter. Drafts can only be viewed by those who have write access to the repository, so it is not shown to the public until they are published.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Uploading your own files</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">There are cases where you might want to provide precompiled binaries for a variety of operating systems. For your Android application, it would be the <kbd class="calibre13">apk</kbd> files; for Windows, <kbd class="calibre13">msi</kbd> or <kbd class="calibre13">exe</kbd>; for Debian, <kbd class="calibre13">deb</kbd>; for RedHat, <kbd class="calibre13">rpm</kbd>, and so on.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When you create a release, there is a window at the very bottom that tells you to attach any binaries. Here, I uploaded a test <kbd class="calibre13">github-essentials.zip</kbd> file as you can see in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00053.jpeg" class="calibre63"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You can upload multiple files, but bear in mind that GitHub limits the upload size to 2 GB for each file. After you successfully upload the new binary and publish the release, you can see the files you manually attached along with the source code GitHub released for you:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Tips and tricks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Here is a tip to get notified about new releases in an atom feed. Also, while you familiarize yourself with Git, you'll be happy to know that you can edit a project's wiki locally.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Subscribing to new releases via atom feed</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you are used to subscribing to feeds to learn the news regarding your favorite blogs, you will be happy to know that you can subscribe to get notified about new releases on GitHub.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Simply go to the releases page and append <kbd class="calibre13">.atom</kbd> to the end of the URL. For example, <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/releases" class="calibre10">https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/releases</a> becomes <a href="https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/releases.atom" class="calibre10">https://github.com/diaspora/diaspora/releases.atom</a>. Cool, isn't it?</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Editing the wiki locally</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As mentioned in the wiki commit history section, every wiki is a separate git repository. As such, you can clone it, make changes locally, and push back to GitHub.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It is powered by the <kbd class="calibre13">gollum</kbd> Ruby library that we will install and use to preview the wiki locally.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Installing gollum</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The <kbd class="calibre13">gollum</kbd> library is packaged as a Ruby gem, and the easiest and quickest way to install it is to follow the official wiki entry at <a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Installation" class="calibre10">https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki/Installation</a>. You can probably avoid installing it system-wide, but this is not within the scope of this guide.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Cloning the wiki and viewing the preview in your browser</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Back on our wiki page, you should have noticed the download link. Every wiki repository has a remote URL encapsulated in green as shown in the following screenshot; essentially, it is the URL of the main Git repository with <kbd class="calibre13">.wiki</kbd> appended to the URL:</p>
<div><img src="img/00055.jpeg" class="calibre65"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Use this URL and clone the wiki; then, run the <kbd class="calibre13">gollum</kbd> command inside that repository:</p>
<pre class="calibre18">git clone https://github.com/axilleas/github-essentials-v2.wiki.git
cd github-essentials-v2.wiki
gollum</pre>
<div><p class="calibre19">Although not stated, you can also clone the wiki using the Git protocol and not HTTP.</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre3">If you see an output similar to the following, then <kbd class="calibre13">gollum</kbd> will successfully run and you can preview the wiki in your browser at <kbd class="calibre13">0.0.0.0:4567</kbd>:</p>
<pre class="calibre18">[2015-07-26 01:09:34] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1

<p class="calibre3">The interface should be familiar with the GitHub wiki. Let's make a few changes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Making changes locally and pushing to GitHub</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Now that you have a running instance of the wiki, you can make changes in the browser much like in GitHub or use an editor such as <kbd class="calibre13">vim</kbd> or <kbd class="calibre13">emacs</kbd> and edit the files directly.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Since you already know how to edit the wiki in the browser, let's use an editor and change the <kbd class="calibre13">Installation.md</kbd> file. After the edit, save the file and commit it to Git. Take a second to see the log with <kbd class="calibre13">git log</kbd> and compare it with the history of the commits in GitHub (at <kbd class="calibre13">https://github.com/&lt;username&gt;/&lt;repository&gt;/wiki/_history</kbd>).</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now push the changes back to GitHub and visit the history page again. The new commit should be there along with the new change.</p>
<div><p class="calibre19">If you want to write in a different markup language, other than Markdown, see the readme at <a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum#installation" class="calibre25">https://github.com/gollum/gollum#installation</a> for ways to install the necessary gems.</p>
</div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, you learned the importance of documentation and how GitHub allows you to host a Markdown-powered wiki along with every project. Creating, deleting, editing, and reverting pages should by now be familiar terms.</p>
<p class="calibre3">What is the connection between releases and tags, you ask? Well, if you read the second part of this chapter, you should already know what connects them and how to create releases and distribute them to the public.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, you will see the management of organizations and teams. Read on and learn how to harness the power of collaboration.</p>
