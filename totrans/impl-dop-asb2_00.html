<p class="mce-root">Ansible has taken the DevOps world by storm. Its highly scalable architecture and modular implementation have made it an ideal tool for implementing DevOps solutions at organizations large and small. Implementing DevOps with Ansible 2 will provide detailed tutorials and information on how to implement DevOps solutions at your organization.Implementing DevOps with Ansible 2 aims to help encourage good software development and delivery practices within organizations by educating you on both the practical technology side of DevOps implementations as well as the cultural and collaborative implementations.Throughout the course of this book, we walk through many examples and solutions for common DevOps implementation shortcomings and automation requirements. The book walks you step by step through the implementation of solutions using examples that are easy to read and follow and simple to understand.As the author of Implementing DevOps with Ansible 2, it is my sincerest hope that this book helps you in your quest to become more DevOps and Ansible proficient. As such, I have set up a website to help readers further their knowledge and reach out to me for any questions. The URL is <a href="http://www.ansibledevops.com">http://www.ansibledevops.com</a>.</p>

<p class="mce-root"><a href="acc50cd0-c996-406a-b266-2a5b4ce1243c.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>DevOps Fundamentals</em>, introduces you to DevOps (a hybrid word connecting development and operations) and educates you on the DevOps movement and how DevOps has in recent years revolutionized software development and delivery at organizations around the globe.</p>
<p class="mce-root"><a href="5e63e9f5-e969-46bf-81ce-fdd8aec22bd8.xhtml">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Configuration Management Essentials</em>, will teach you how tools like Ansible can make developers, testers, and operations work easier by eliminating environment drift, automating the provisioning of infrastructure, and providing an easy and consistent way to spin up bug reproduction environments.</p>
