                    <h1 class="header-title">Preface</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Over the last few years, the world of IT has seen radical shifts in the ways in which software applications are developed and deployed. The rise of automation, cloud computing, and virtualization has fundamentally shifted how system administrators, software developers, and organizations as a whole view and manage infrastructure. Just a few years ago, it would seem unthinkable to many in the IT industry to allow mission-critical applications to be run outside the walls of the corporate data center. However, now there are more organizations than ever migrating infrastructure to cloud services such as AWS, Azure, and Google Compute in an effort to save time and cut back on overhead costs related to running physical infrastructure. By abstracting away the hardware, companies can focus on what really matters—the software applications that serve their users.</p>
<p>The next great tidal wave within the IT field formally started in 2013 with the initial release of the Docker container engine. Docker allowed users to easily package software into small, reusable execution environments known as containers, leveraging features in the Linux kernel for use with LXC (Linux Containers). Using Docker, developers can create microservice applications that can be built quickly, are guaranteed to run in any environment, and leverage reusable service artifacts (container images) that can be version controlled. As more and more users adopted containerized workflows, gaps in execution began to appear. While Docker was great at building and running containers, it struggled to be a true end-to-end solution across the entire container life cycle.</p>
<p>The Ansible Container project was developed to bring the power of the Ansible configuration management and automation platform to the world of containers. Ansible Container bridges the container life cycle management gap by allowing container build and deploy pipelines to speak the Ansible language. Using Ansible Container, you can leverage the powerful Ansible configuration management language to not only build containers, but deploy full-scale applications on remote servers and cloud platforms.</p>
<p>This book will serve as a guide to working with the Ansible Container project. It is my goal that by the end of this book, you will have a firm understanding of how Ansible Container works, and how to leverage its many capabilities to build robust containerized software stacks from development all the way to production.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What this book covers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p><a href="61a61ca8-60d4-48a0-8987-6f719d6a2c36.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Building Containers with Docker</em>, introduces the reader to what Docker is, how it works, and the basics of using Dockerfiles and Docker Compose. This chapter lays down the foundational concepts needed to start learning how to use Ansible Container.</p>
<p><a href="089af66a-24d7-4d4d-bcfd-56bfe873ea91.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Working with Ansible Container</em>, explores the Ansible Container workflow. This chapter gives the reader familiarity with the core Ansible Container concepts such as build, run, and destroy.</p>
<p><a href="4b15cefb-8d9c-48b7-8927-126501886315.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Your First Ansible Container Project</em>, gives the user experience in building a simple Ansible Container project by leveraging a community role available on Ansible Galaxy. By the end of this chapter, the reader will be familiar with building projects and pushing container artifacts to container image repositories such as Docker Hub.</p>
<p><a href="747fd1c6-46e4-424a-be59-5bbf20deb5ed.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 4</a>, <em>What's in a Role?</em>, gives the user an overview of how to write custom container-enabled roles for use with Ansible Container. The overarching goal of this chapter is to write a role that builds a fully functional MariaDB container image from scratch. By the end of this chapter, the user should have basic familiarity with writing Ansible playbooks using proper style and syntax.</p>
<p><a href="ccc07e61-25e7-4984-953b-586b28b12aab.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Containers at Scale with Kubernetes</em>, gives the reader an overview of the Kubernetes platform and core functionality. In this chapter, the reader will have the opportunity to create a multi-node Kubernetes cluster in the Google Cloud and run containers inside it.</p>
<p><a href="d3c6ddae-003d-4f20-a3a5-efd018ac61ee.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Managing Containers with OpenShift</em>, introduces the reader to Redhat's OpenShift platform. This chapter gives the reader the steps required to deploy a local OpenShift cluster using Minishift and run containerized workloads on it. This chapter also looks at the key differences between Kubernetes and OpenShift, even though the architectures are fundamentally similar.</p>
<p><a href="ef89f30f-00a9-4f4c-93b9-009474fc3022.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Deploying Your First Project</em> takes an in-depth look at the final command in the Ansible Container workflow—deploy. Using deploy, the reader will gain first-hand experience of deploying previously built projects to Kubernetes and OpenShift using the Ansible Container as an end-to-end workflow tool.</p>
<p><a href="f734178a-8a55-4fc5-9961-13e8182fdda7.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 8</a>, <em>Building and Deploying a Multi-Container Project</em>, looks at how Ansible Container can be used to build a project that leverages more than one application container. Critical to a full understanding of this topic is an introduction to container networking and configuring containers to access network resources. This chapter will give the reader an opportunity to build and deploy a multi-container project using Django, Gulp, NGINX, and PostgreSQL containers.</p>
<p><a href="5137aec5-ebc9-44cc-938b-8959117fff8c.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 9</a>, <em>Going Further with Ansible Container</em>, gives the reader an idea of the next steps to take after mastering the entire Ansible Container workflow. Topics explored in this section include integrating Ansible Container with CICD tools, and sharing projects on Ansible Galaxy.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">What you need for this book</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This book assumes a beginner-to-medium level of experience of working with the Linux operating system, deploying applications, and managing servers. This book walks you through the steps required to bring up a fully-functional lab environment on your local laptop to quickly get up and running using a Virtualbox and Vagrant environment. Prior to starting, it would be helpful to have Virtualbox, Vagrant, and the Git command-line client installed and running on your personal computer. To run this environment with full specifications, the following system requirements must be met or exceeded:</p>
<ul>
<li>CPU: 2 cores (Intel Core i5 or equivalent)</li>
<li>Memory: 8 GB RAM</li>
<li>Disk space: 80 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>In this book, you will need the following software list:</p>
<ul>
<li>VirtualBox 5.1 or higher</li>
<li>Vagrant 1.9.1 or higher</li>
<li>A text editor that edits YAML files (GitHub Atom or VIM preferred)
<p> </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Internet connectivity is required to install the necessary packages.</p>

<p>This book is designed to assist those currently working as system administrators, DevOps engineers, or technical architects, (or similar roles) to quickly get up and running with the Ansible Container workflow. It is helpful as well if the reader already has a basic understanding of Docker, Ansible, or other related automation platforms prior to reading the book, although not required. It is my hope that a user can get a firm understanding of these basics while reading the book. The end goal is to help readers gain a solid foundation on how Ansible Container can accelerate building, running, testing, and deploying application containers from development to production environments.</p>
