    it so easy for a help desk team to manage its work. So far in this book, we've
    been discussing various aspects of Jira. We've already covered Jira Core and Jira
    Software features by creating projects to understand how you and your team can
    use this intuitive tool to manage tasks and development activities. Jira Service
    Desk was built while keeping in mind customer satisfaction first and foremost,
    and making it very simple for any customer to raise and track their tickets in
    Jira Service Desk using a friendly customer portal; at the same time, technicians
    (also known as agents) work on those tickets using a familiar Jira interface.

    types of users; one is your customer, who will raise a ticket on the system to
    get help from the service or support desk. The agent, on the other hand, will
    respond to the tickets and provide help to the customers.'

    You can''t expect them to wait indefinitely after raising a ticket. The service
    level agreement, also commonly known as SLA, defines how quickly agents will respond
    and resolve the ticket. Multiple SLAs can be defined and agreed with the customer
    or your client when providing services to them. SLAs are nothing but a time frame

    comments. It''s a great way to have interaction between them.'

    support request and ticketing system to cater to the requests of end users and
    customers. Using Jira, a simple project can be created to track issues and access
    can be given to customers, provided there're enough licenses; however, but in
    general, end users may not find it intuitive to log in to an issue tracker to
    raise their requests. Atlassian understood this concern and created a Service
    Desk application with a dedicated customer portal, which is a quite neat and simple
    interface on which to raise support requests.

    Jira Service Desk is closely integrated with the Confluence space by providing
    related articles to the user while they're raising a new request, which might
    be a known issue or a very common request. In such cases, an article in the linked
    Confluence space can help users to serve themselves.
