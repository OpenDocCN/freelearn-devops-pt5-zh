    from the project that helps everyone to analyze the information. These reports
    help management take wise decisions at the right time. JIRA offers a lot of built-in
    project reports, which will be explained in this chapter. Dashboards will also
    be explained here to help you understand how you can share project statistics
    with other users.

    to derive useful information from it. JIRA comes with built-in reports that show
    real-time statistics for projects, users, and other fields. At the time of running
    the project, reports will always display the most up-to-date information.

    users, which are either assignees or reporters. When you open any project page,
    the default view is the summary view, which contains an **Activity Stream** that
    shows whatever is happening in the project, such as the creation of new issues,
    status updates, comments, and, basically, any change in the project.

    These gadgets can be configured to display a variety of statistics based on different
    fields associated with a particular project or filter. Although they are good,
    these reports and gadgets sometimes do not provide the exact consolidated information.
    One can also query the JIRA database directly to fetch the data and look for reports
    that are not available through the user interface, but not everyone can do that
    easily as it requires very good knowledge of the JIRA database. In [Chapter 13](ch13.html

    queries that you can use to fetch data directly from the database. However, if

    to us; the **Pages** section contains the fields that act as a filter on the current
    report. The **Rows** and **Columns** sections contain the two fields based on
    which the report will be generated. You can drag more fields from **Dimensions**
    to any of these three sections. The following sample report is based on **Line**
    but you can select **Bar**, **Pie**, and several other types of graphs. The best
    thing about eazyBI is that these reports are drill-through reports, in other words,
    you can click on the specific section of the report and analyze that portion separately.
    You can add more reports based on any field of your choice.
