- en: Apps are a new feature introduced in Dynamics 365 or Dynamics CRM version 9.x.
    Prior to the following versions of Dynamics CRM, it was not possible to create
    custom apps catering to any module in Dynamics CRM implementations. There used
    to exist one single layer of the site map which provided links to various entities,
    dashboards, and more, for the entire organization. However, with Microsoft Dynamics
    365, Microsoft has introduced the concepts of apps which can cater to specific
    business areas or modules. Also, we have the built-in App Designer in the product
    itself. This designer allows the administrator, customizers, or users with appropriate
    privileges, to easily design an app by simply adding, dragging, and dropping the
    components, within the App Designer canvas.

- en: In this chapter, we saw how apps are introduced as a new and powerful navigation
    feature in Dynamics 365\. We also understood how apps provide the users with quick
    access to the most relevant options they need to carry out their day-to-day CRM
    work. Now we can have multiple site maps per app, and built-in App Designer tools
    in the product itself. We also had a detailed look at the new App Designer and
    some common operations that can be performed through it.
