<p class="mce-root">Security is one of the most important aspects of any information system. With Jira, this includes managing different levels of access and ensuring that information is accessible only to authorized users.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the different levels of access control in Jira. We will also cover other security-related topics, including enforcing password strength and capturing and auditing changes in Jira for regulatory compliance.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Granting access to Jira</li>
<li>Granting Jira System Administrator access</li>
<li>Controlling access to a project</li>
<li>Controlling access to Jira issue operations</li>
<li>Allowing users to control permissions</li>
<li>Delegating administrator permissions</li>
<li>Restricting access to projects based on reporter permissions</li>
<li>Setting up password policies</li>
<li>Capturing electronic signatures for changes</li>
<li>Changing the duration of the 'remember me' cookies</li>
<li>Changing the default session timeout</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Granting access to Jira</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since Jira is now a platform that includes Jira Core, Jira Software, Jira Service Desk, and other third-party applications, you can have multiple applications running on the same platform instance. This is because user access is granted on a per-application level. In this recipe, we will look at managing access to applications in Jira.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To grant Jira access to a group, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to Jira as a Jira Administrator.</li>
<li>Navigate to Administration<strong> </strong>&gt; Applications &gt; Application access.</li>
<li>Select and add the group to gain access to the application:</li>

<p>It's time to look at how the steps work.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Starting with JIRA 7, Atlassian introduced the new concept of <strong>applications</strong>. This turns Jira into a platform, and major features, such as JIRA Agile (now called Jira Software) and Jira Service Desk, are now separate applications that run on the Jira platform. These changes mean that you can now control user access to each of the applications individually. Instead of using permissions to control who can access Jira, you can assign access rights based on the application.</p>
<p>When it comes to granting access to applications, you can only do that through groups. So, you need to ensure that you have designed your groups appropriately in order for users to have access to the correct applications.</p>
<p>If you are in a group with Jira Administrators global permission (refer to the next recipe), such as <kbd>jira-administrators</kbd>, but the group does not have access to the Jira Software application, then you will still be able to log in to Jira and perform administrative tasks, but you will not have access to any projects and issues.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If you have assigned more than one group to an application from the application access page, you can select one or more groups as the default group. This means that, when new users are added to the system, they will be automatically added to the default group, so they can start using Jira right away.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Granting Jira System Administrator access</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the previous recipe, we demonstrated how to grant access to applications in Jira to users. In this recipe, we will take a look at how to grant administrative access to users. In the same way as granting user access, you can only grant administrative access to a group of users.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To grant administrative access to a group in Jira, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; System &gt; Global permissions.</li>
<li>Select the Jira System Administrators<strong> </strong>option from the <strong>Permissions</strong> list, and select the group you want to grant access to, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/e9f30c90-303c-4815-a5a7-b290493ed092.png" style="width:44.83em;height:17.75em;"/></div>
<p>Let's understand the working now.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are two levels of administrative access in Jira: <strong>Jira Administrator</strong> and <strong>Jira System Administrator</strong>. For the most part, they have identical functions when it comes to Jira configurations, such as custom fields and workflows. Jira System Administrators have additional access to system-wide application configurations, such as the SMTP mail server configuration, installing apps, and updating Jira licenses.</p>
<p>Out of the box, the <kbd>jira-administrators</kbd> group has the global permissions of both Jira Administrator and Jira System Administrator. If you want to distinguish between the two different levels of administration, you can create two separate groups and grant them different permissions.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Controlling access to a project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the previous recipes, we looked at how to use global permissions to control Jira access and administrator-level access. In this recipe, we will demonstrate how to control project-level permissions, starting with access to projects.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To control project-level access, we use permission schemes. Jira comes with a default permission scheme, which is applied automatically to all projects. You can use this scheme and update its permission settings directly. For this recipe, we will start by creating a new permission scheme to illustrate the whole process. If you want to just use the default scheme, you can skip the first three steps.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>First, we need to create a new permission scheme, which can be done through the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Issues &gt; Permission schemes.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Add Permission Scheme </strong>button.</li>
<li>Enter the new scheme's name and click on Add.</li>
<li>With the permission scheme created, we then need to grant permissions to users and groups, namely, the Browse Projects<strong> </strong>permission, which controls access to projects.</li>
<li>Click on the Permissions link for the new permission scheme.</li>
<li>Click on the Edit link for the Browse Projects permission.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="7">
<li>Select who to grant the permission to. For example, if you want to limit access to only members of a group, you can select the Group option, choose the target group, and click on Grant:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/1bc6f798-065a-4831-815a-98288575b93f.png" style="width:26.42em;height:26.08em;"/></div>
<p>We can grant permissions to multiple users and groups, and, once finished, we can apply the permission scheme to the project that we want:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the project that you want to apply the permission scheme to and click on the Administration tab.</li>
<li>Select the Permissions option on the left-hand side, and click on the Use a different scheme option from the Actions menu:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/171b6c35-fc0e-4970-a5da-222033b8d9a8.png"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Select the new permission scheme and click on Associate.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Permission schemes define project-level permissions. Unlike global permissions, which can only be granted to groups, these can be granted to specific users, groups, project roles, and more. The option you choose here will depend on your use case. Generally speaking, groups will be the most straightforward option, as users often belong to one or more groups and you can easily model your permission requirements based on groups. Other options are useful when you have special or edge cases where you need to accommodate users that do not fit into your group setup. Once the permission scheme is configured, you can apply the scheme to individual projects. In this way, different projects can have different permission schemes to suit their needs.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Controlling access to Jira issue operations</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this recipe, we will take a look at permissions that control issue operations. These are the operations that your end users will perform on a daily basis, including create, edit, delete, comment, and more.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Just as we saw in the previous recipe, you can either use an existing permission scheme or create a new permission scheme. For this recipe, we will continue working with the permission scheme that we created previously.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To set up permission schemes for issue operations, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to the project that you want to apply the permission scheme to and click on the Administration tab.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Select the Permissions option on the left-hand side and click on the Edit Permissions option from the Actions menu:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/0905733a-bc6e-43e3-951e-08a875b67db2.png"/></p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click on the Edit link for the permissions that you want to update, such as Create Issue and Edit Issue. Note that issue-related permissions are grouped under the Issue permissions heading.</li>
<li>Select the target to grant the permission to and click on Grant.</li>
</ol>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If in doubt, or if you have users reporting permission-related issues, you can always use the Permission helper tool (shown in the following screenshot) to check your configurations. All you have to do is enter the user's username, select an issue that is in the project, choose the type of permission, and click on Submit. The tool will go through your permission configurations and display a report that explains what is required for the selected permission so that you can work out why the user does or does not have the selected permission:</p>
<div><img src="img/f9f3416a-5a7c-4108-89c0-030608597a8f.png" style="width:39.83em;height:40.33em;"/></div>
<p>You will always be asked to select an issue when using the Permission helper tool, even if you want to check a project-level permission, such as administer projects. In this case, simply select an issue that belongs to the project, and the tool will verify the permission for you.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Allowing users to control permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you have a mixed group of users (such as internal employees and outside consultants) working on the same Jira project, there will be instances regarding sensitive information that should only be viewed by internal employees. In these cases, you will want to mark those instances as internal only, so that other people cannot see them.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will demonstrate how to set up permissions to control access at the issue level with issue security schemes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The steps for setting up issue-level permissions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Since Jira does not come with any default issue security schemes, the first step is to create a new one from scratch:
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Issues &gt; Issue security schemes.</li>
<li>Click on the Add issue security scheme<strong> </strong>link.</li>
<li>Enter a name for the new scheme and then click on Add.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>The second step is to set up the security levels that you can choose from, such as Internal Users Only:
<ol>
<li>Click on the Security Levels<strong> </strong>link for our new issue security scheme.</li>
<li>Enter the name for each security level and click on the Add Security Level button.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also click on the Default link to make a security level the default choice. This will pre-select the default security level while creating new issues in projects that are using the issue security scheme.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 90px">The following screenshot shows the three existing security levels:</p>
<div><img src="img/3cbf1d13-7c76-454e-af81-10ed21376833.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>After we have set up the security levels, the third step is to grant users access to each of the security levels that you have defined:
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong>Add </strong>link for the security level you want to set up the user access for.</li>
<li>Select the permission option and click on the <strong>Add </strong>button.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">The following screenshot displays the different options you have while granting security levels:</p>
<div><img src="img/609f3b13-9510-4b10-8863-7899983f06af.png" style="width:28.42em;height:32.17em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now that we have all of the security levels set up, the last step is to apply the issue security scheme to our project:
<ol>
<li>Go to the project you want to apply the issue security scheme to and click on the Administration tab.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Issue Security </strong>option on the left-hand side and click on the Select a scheme option from the Actions menu.</li>
<li>Select the new issue security scheme and click on Next.</li>
<li>If the project is not empty, Jira asks you to select a default security level for all of the issues. You can select the None option so that all issues remain as they are, or you can select a security level that is applied to all issues.</li>
<li>Click on the Associate button:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/5b29a0f5-0f6b-4bb7-a746-e26ccc9e4b76.png" style="width:33.08em;height:8.58em;"/></div>
<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, the issue security scheme is now applied to the project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The issue security scheme allows you, as an end user, to control who can access individual issues, based on the security levels set. Issues with the security level can only be viewed by those who meet the criteria. Note that the subtasks inherit security levels from their parent issues.</p>
<p>Once we have applied the issue security scheme to a project, users with the Set Issue Security permission are able to select a security level while creating and editing issues, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/f093045c-aad1-4f86-925e-9e89d19ff833.png" style="width:34.00em;height:27.17em;"/></p>
<p>If you do not see the Security Level field, make sure the field is added to the screen and that you have the Set Issue Security permission. You can use the Permission helper feature covered in the previous recipe to verify this.</p>
<p>It is also worth mentioning that you can only select security levels that you belong to. For example, if there are two security levels, <em>A</em> and <em>B</em>, then security level <em>A</em> is granted to the <kbd>jira-administrators</kbd> group, and security level <em>B</em> is granted to the <kbd>jira-users</kbd> group. Now, as a member of the <kbd>jira-users</kbd> group, you will only be able to select security level <em>B</em>. This is to prevent users from accidentally locking themselves out of an issue by selecting the wrong security level.</p>
<p>A user who meets the criteria for the selected security level is able to view the issue normally. However, if a user who does not meet the criteria tries to view the issue, they get a permission violation error, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/754ab64b-05be-44da-8ea4-6844b987a06e.png" style="width:26.33em;height:9.17em;"/></div>
<p>This message also informs users that the may have been deleted.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Delegating administrator permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Most customization and configuration options, such as workflows and screens, are managed by Jira Administrators. While this model may work well for a small organization, it often causes a bottleneck for larger organizations, where many customizations to these core Jira functions are required and there are only a few Jira Administrators who can actually make the necessary changes.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will look at how you can enable project administrators to make some of these customizations themselves without having to rely entirely on Jira Administrators.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To allow project administrators to make customization changes, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Issues &gt; Permission schemes.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Permissions</strong> link for the permission scheme used by the project. If there is no permission scheme specifically for the project, create a new permission scheme by first cloning the current scheme used by clicking on the <strong>Copy</strong> link.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>Extended project administration</strong> option under the <strong>Administer Projects</strong> permission:</li>

<p>Once the permission scheme has the Extended project administration option enabled, administrators of projects using that permission scheme will be allowed to make changes to the project's workflows and screens.</p>

<p>The Extended project administration option allows project administrators to make changes to workflows and screens with certain limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Workflows cannot be used by other projects.</li>
<li>Only statuses that already exist in Jira can be added to workflows. Project administrators cannot create new statuses.</li>
<li>The existing status in a workflow can be deleted only if no issues in the project are currently in the status.</li>
<li>Workflow transitions can be deleted from the workflow, but details such as properties, validators, conditions, post-functions, and screens cannot be changed.</li>
<li>Only non-system screens, that is, screens created by Jira Administrators, can be updated.</li>
<li>Screens cannot be used by other projects.</li>
<li>Only existing fields, both custom and system, can be added to screens.</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Restricting access to projects based on reporter permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As you have seen in one of the previous recipes, the Browse Projects permission controls who can access a project in Jira. In this recipe, we will set up permissions so that users can only see projects they can create issues in and not the projects in which they cannot.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since we will be making direct changes to a Jira system file, make sure you create backups for any modified files. This recipe will also require a restart of Jira, so plan this during a time slot that will not affect your users.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To restrict access to projects based on who can or cannot report criterion, you first need to enable a special permission type, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <kbd>permission-types.xml</kbd> file from the <kbd>JIRA_INSTALL/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes</kbd> directory in a text editor.</li>
<li>Locate the following lines, and uncomment the <kbd>reportercreate</kbd> permission type, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<pre>        &lt;!-- Uncomment &amp; use this permission to show only projects
        where the user has create permission and issues
        within that where they are the reporter. --&gt;

        &lt;!-- This permission type should only ever be assigned to
        the "Browse Projects" permission. --&gt;

        &lt;!-- Other permissions can use the "reporter" or "create"
        permission type as appropriate. --&gt;

        &lt;!-- &lt;type id="reportercreate" enterprise="true"&gt;
          &lt;class&gt;com.atlassian.jira.security.type<br/><br/>          .CurrentReporterHasCreatePermission&lt;/class&gt;

        &lt;/type&gt;

        --&gt;</pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>Restart Jira for the changes to apply.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once the <kbd>reportercreate</kbd> permission type is enabled, a new Reporter option (which shows only projects with create permissions) is displayed while working with permission schemes, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
<div><img src="img/76ca3e85-46c4-452e-a1b9-c67cd0db0824.png" style="width:29.00em;height:24.25em;"/></div>
<p>Projects with permission schemes that use this option for the Browse Projects permission are viewable only by users who can create issues in them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The <kbd>reportercreate</kbd> permission type checks whether the current user has permission to create issues in a given project. This is different than the default reporter or the current reporter permission type, which make the project visible to all users.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Additionally, note that this permission should only be applied to the Browse Projects permission. If applied to other permissions, especially the Create Issues permission, it causes Jira to go into an infinite loop, and that is the reason why this permission type is disabled by default.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There is also a similar Assignee (which only shows projects with assignable permissions) permission type, which can be enabled in the <kbd>permission-types.xml</kbd> file. Similar to the reporter equivalent, this permission type checks whether users can be assigned issues in the project. Just like the reporter permission type, this should only be applied to the Browse Projects permission:</p>
<pre>&lt;!-- Uncomment &amp; use this permission to show only projects where the user has the assignable permission and issues within that where they are the assignee --&gt;

&lt;!-- This permission type should only ever be assigned to the "Browse Projects" permission. --&gt;

&lt;!-- Other permissions can use the "reporter" or "create" permission type as appropriate. --&gt;

&lt;!-- 
&lt;type id="assigneeassignable" enterprise="true"&gt;
  &lt;class&gt;com.atlassian.jira.security.type
  .CurrentAssigneeHasAssignablePermission&lt;/class&gt;

&lt;/type&gt;

--&gt;</pre>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up password policies</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>By default, Jira allows you to create a password of any combination and length. For security, organizations often need to have password policies such as password length and complexity to strengthen the passwords and make them difficult to guess.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will demonstrate how to set up password policies in Jira to define the strength of passwords.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To enable and configure the password policy settings, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; System &gt; Password Policy.</li>
<li>Select from one of the predefined policy settings; alternatively, select the Custom option and configure the settings yourself.</li>
<li>Click on the Update button to enable the password policy, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/f5052a93-144a-453f-8b36-a5b674feae3c.png" style="width:26.50em;height:37.33em;"/></div>
<p>Generally, it is better to use the custom option and set your own password policy rather than using one of the predefined options, as it gives you more control and allows you to enforce more secure passwords for your users.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>With the password policy configured, every time someone tries to create a new password, Jira will make sure that the new password satisfies the policy rules. If it does not, error messages are displayed with information on the requirements, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/664a9ec5-0550-4f83-9ef9-171c36ff56fb.png" style="width:33.83em;height:27.08em;"/></div>
<p>The error messages show that some rules are not satisfied.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Apart from the built-in password policy feature, there is also a third-party app called <strong>Enterprise Password Policy for Jira</strong>, which provides features such as password age and user account locking to make your Jira compliant with ISO/IEC 27002. You can get the app at <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.intenso.jira.plugins.password-policy" target="_blank">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.intenso.jira.plugins.password-policy</a>.</p>
<p>After you have installed the app in Jira, there will be a new Password Policy section in Manage apps, under Administration. Click on the Configure option and then on Password Complexity, and you will be able to set your password policy, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/ab619309-db95-4f72-823d-0210224e9a64.png"/></div>
<p>You need to disable the default password policy feature to use this app.</p>
<p class="mce-root">As you can see from the preceding screenshot, there are more options and controls for you to define your password policies compared to the out-of-the-box feature from Jira.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Capturing electronic signatures for changes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Organizations that have strict regulatory requirements often need to capture <strong>electronic signatures</strong> (or <strong>e-signatures</strong>) as issues move along the workflow, for future auditing purposes. This is often a part of the CFR Part 11 compliance.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In this recipe, we will look at how to enforce and capture e-signatures when someone tries to transition an issue through the workflow.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>For this recipe, we need to install the CFR Part 11 E-Signatures app. You can download the app at <a href="https://docs.appfusions.com/display/PRT11J/Home">https://docs.appfusions.com/display/PRT11J/Home</a>, and then install it in Manage apps in the administration console. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To start capturing electronic signatures, we first need to create an <strong>Electronic Signature</strong> custom field:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Issues &gt; Custom fields.</li>
<li>Click on the Add Custom Field<strong> </strong>button and select the Advanced tab.</li>
<li>Choose the Electronic Signature<strong> </strong>custom field type and click on Next.</li>
<li>Name the custom field <kbd>E-Signatures</kbd> and click on Next.</li>
<li>Select a screen to place the custom field onto. For example, if you want to capture signatures when users resolve an issue, you will need to select the screen used for the <strong>Resolve Issue </strong>transition.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Update </strong>button:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/02c78b73-4831-45ab-9bf6-1c5c08e74828.png" style="width:45.25em;height:28.33em;"/></div>
<div><p>You need to have a screen for the operations for which you want to capture electronic signatures.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once you have created an Electronic Signature custom field and added it onto a screen, such as the Resolve Issue screen, it will be displayed as two text fields: one for the username and one for the password.</p>
<p>The workflow transition can only be completed when the user signs the action by putting in their username and password, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/353f3ce7-3fda-4e51-b5ee-1ef6baecd33d.png" style="width:44.50em;height:25.25em;"/></div>
<p>If the signature verification is successful and the transition is complete, the electronic signature will be stored, and you can get a report by clicking on the new E-Signatures issue tab at the bottom of the web page:</p>
<div><img src="img/09cd7312-ba4a-4a29-9729-2df412d4743c.png" style="width:46.17em;height:16.33em;"/></div>
<p>The e-signatures app also has a Restricted Mode option (which is turned off by default). This forces users to use their own credentials when providing e-signature. You can enable this restricted mode by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Manage apps &gt; E-Signature Fields.</li>
<li>Check the Restricted Mode<strong> </strong>option and click on Save.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once enabled, the username field is automatically set to the current user's username, so you can only sign with your own password.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Changing the duration of the remember me cookies</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When a user selects the Remember my login on this computer checkbox, the user doesn't need to re-enter their credentials again from the same browser, unless they are explicitly logged out. In addition to this, by default, this feature lasts for two weeks.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will look at how to change the duration, extend it to the maximum extent possible, or reduce it to be consistent with your security requirements.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since we will be making direct changes to a Jira system file, make sure you create backups for any files that you modify. This recipe will also require a restart of Jira, so plan this during a time slot that will not affect your users.</p>

<p>To change the 'remember me' cookie duration, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the <kbd>seraph-config.xml</kbd> file from the <kbd>JIRA_INSTALL/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/classes</kbd> directory in a text editor.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Locate the <kbd>autologin.cookie.age</kbd> line, and change the value of <kbd>param-value</kbd> to the desired number in seconds:</li>
</ol>
<pre style="padding-left: 60px">&lt;init-param&gt;
    &lt;param-name&gt;autologin.cookie.age&lt;/param-name&gt;
    &lt;param-value&gt;1209600&lt;/param-value&gt;

<p>Jira uses the Seraph framework (<a href="https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-seraph/latest" target="_blank">https://docs.atlassian.com/atlassian-seraph/latest</a>) to manage its HTTP session cookies. When the Remember me option is checked, it creates <kbd>seraph.rememberme.cookie</kbd>.</p>
<p>The <kbd>seraph-config.xml</kbd> file is used to configure the Seraph framework and the <kbd>autologin.cookie.age</kbd> parameter is used to set the maximum age for the cookie.</p>
