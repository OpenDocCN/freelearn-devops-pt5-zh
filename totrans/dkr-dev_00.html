			<p>Software engineering teams are rapidly adopting containers to package and deploy their software. Providing a platform-agnostic experience, containers allow you to run applications with a variety of operating system images and to deploy on-premises, in data centers, and in the cloud. In order to support container-based applications, vendors have developed a wide variety of tools, ranging from Docker and Google's Kubernetes project to Lyft's Envoy service mesh and Netflix's Spinnaker. Whether you are working on the software development side of the house, hosting, and infrastructure, or constructing DevOps pipelines, you need both a broad and in-depth understanding of many concepts in order to manage container-based environments.</p>
			<p>In <em class="italic">Docker for Developers</em>, we will start with a walk-through of the basics of developing with containers locally using Docker, and then move on to deploying production-ready, cloud-hosted systems with AWS. If you are interested in learning about container orchestration, deployment, monitoring, and security, then we think you will enjoy this book.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor008"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p><em class="italic">Docker for Developers</em> is geared toward engineers and DevOps personnel who want to learn the basics of containers and then build upon this knowledge to understand how to use containers in production, through a set of successively more sophisticated deployments. We will demonstrate how Docker applications can be deployed via CI/CD pipelines and managed in a production-grade, cloud-hosted environment. A basic understanding of containers would be helpful when tackling the book's subject matter, but this is not essential. It is assumed that readers of this book are familiar with Linux, the use of command-line tools, and basic software engineering concepts, such as version control and using Git.</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-10"><a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>You will need a Windows, Mac, or Linux workstation that can run Docker. You should use the latest version if possible. Additionally, in order to complete any of the cloud-based projects, you will need to set up a cloud provider account. The examples use <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>), although you could adapt much of the content to services hosted by another cloud provider:</p>
