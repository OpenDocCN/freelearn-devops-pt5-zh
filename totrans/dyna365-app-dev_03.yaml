    Process Flows with an improved Business Process Flow designer. Using the Business
    Process Flow editor, system administrators or system customizers can use a rich
    graphical editor to create, edit, and configure Business Process Flows. The Business
    Process Flow editor allows organizations to improve user productivity and the
    time required to do their day-to-day CRM activities.

    and also allows for managing fields to be captured in each. It also helps to restrict
    movements in different stages, based on the required fields to be captured. The
    end-user finds it more convenient because it is simple to use and provides a visual
    understanding of the business by means of the Business Process Flows.
