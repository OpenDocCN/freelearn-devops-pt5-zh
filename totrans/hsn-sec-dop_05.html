<p class="calibre2">Since we have covered the security requirements and security assurance program in previous chapters, in this chapter, we will discuss two case studies looking at the security assurance program and security practices in the DevOps process. Microsoft SDL and SAMM were introduced to apply to the security assurance program. In addition to the process, the non-technical parts, security training, and culture are also critical to the success of the security program. We will also give an example of how security tools and web security framework can help during the whole DevOps process.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre6">In this chapter, w</span>e will learn about the following topics:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Microsoft SDL and SAMM</li>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">Let's take two typical business scenarios to discuss the adoption of a security assurance program. One concerns services built on top of a third-party cloud service provider, and the other concerns building your own, complete cloud services, including <strong class="calibre4">Software as a Service</strong> (<span class="calibre6"><strong class="calibre4">SaaS</strong>)</span>, <strong class="calibre4">Platform as a Service</strong> (<span class="calibre6"><strong class="calibre4">PaaS</strong>)</span>, and <strong class="calibre4">Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<span class="calibre6"><strong class="calibre4">IaaS</strong>)</span>:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img class="alignnone10" src="../images/00024.jpeg"/></p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre1">Scenario 1: Joyce, e-commerce services on a public cloud service: </strong>Joyce is a security leader at an e-commerce company. The company has an in-house software development, IT, and security team. They deploy an e-commerce service based on a third-party cloud service provider, and apply most security services provided by the IaaS/PaaS cloud service provider. Due to the payment and handling of credit card information, compliance with PCI DSS is a must for e-commerce services.</li>
<li class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre1">Scenario 2: John, e-commerce services on self-build cloud service: </strong>John is a CSO of e-commerce services. The key difference in John's case is that there is a well-established security organization team, and lots of security services, such as WAF, IDS, or security monitoring, were self-built and tailored to the business's needs. Furthermore, the e-commerce was built on their own self-operated cloud services. PCI DSS compliance is also a minimum requirement in this case. </li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">For these two scenarios, let's discuss how the adoption of a security assurance program might be different, by reference to Microsoft SDL and OWASP SAMM practices.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The adoption of Microsoft SDL and SAMM in Joyce's case may apply security on top of the framework provided by the cloud service provider. It's always suggested we build security practices based on existing business processes, or to have the security tools integrated to the existing CI or CD framework.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Most cloud service providers provide related cloud security services. In Joyce's case, familiarity with the security services provided by the cloud service provider, as well as how they apply to her e-commerce applications, will help to build a security foundation. In addition, most cloud service providers have been certified with security standards for IaaS and PaaS. This means that Joyce only needs to focus on the data and software security which were built on top of the IaaS and PaaS. In John's case, he will need to self-build or purchase those security services to protect the IaaS, PaaS, and software applications. The following table shows a typical security service provided by a cloud service provider:</p>

<p class="calibre2">Building software applications on top of third-party cloud services may reduce the effort involved in securing a cloud infrastructure and platform. Since Joyce's business requires PCI DSS compliance, security practices are also recommended tied to be the business needs. The following are examples of security practices that Joyce may plan:</p>

<p class="calibre2"> </p>
<p class="calibre2">In John's case, the security assurance program coverage extends to the cloud platform and infrastructure. It means John will need to additionally consider these security controls: security testing, issue management, environment hardening, and operation enablement. Other aspects, such as strategy, policy, education, threat assessment, secure architecture, design review, and implementation review, will be similar to Joyce's case.</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Self-build or buy? The question may be raised whenever we plan tools for security practices. One of the key advantages to using commercial products is to win the customer's trust. It's like the services are tested and certified by third-party commercial tools. On the other hand, self-build security tools enable closer integration with the existing framework, and can be customized to its needs. If you are in such a dilemma due to budget constraints, using open source tools may be a good alternative. Open source tools may provide built-in security rules and knowledge, while also giving you the flexibility to customize to your needs.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">In both John's and Joyce's cases, the theme of security awareness may be focused on PCI DSS compliance. There are many ways to deliver security training, such as posters, newsletters, e-learning or teleconferencing, in-person workshops, or hands-on tutorials. NIST SP 800-50 <strong class="calibre4">Building an Information Technology Security Awareness and Training Program</strong> and PCI DSS <strong class="calibre4">Best Practices for implementing a Security Awareness Program</strong> are two good references for building a security awareness program. Here, we discuss some of the key points to consider when delivering a  security awareness and training program with an organization.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sending newsletters is considered to be one of the most cost-effective and common practices to target all employees across business units. What can be even more effective is to look at a real example or case study that relates to that role or the business. For example, HR may be more interested in stories or case studies about employment related to access control or the required security knowledge certificates for each job grade, rather than security technology or threat introduction. Try to use a case study specific to each role, such as HR, Developers, Testers, or the operations team to explain how security relates to and impacts their jobs. In addition, newsletters are no different than other emails, and may be easily ignored. A simple follow-up online quiz or required email-reply with comments is also suggested. For managers, leaders, and specific roles, the purpose of security awareness is to win their support. The content requires not only security awareness but also that you call them to action. Sometimes, it's not just a one-way message delivery; it can be a forum discussion or the process of seeking consensus to achieve security goals. Whenever possible, face-to-face communication or a forum discussion is recommended for this group.</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the development or operations team, the most effective way to apply security practices is still to have hands-on tutorials and workshops. Engineers love to build and to take part in hands-on exercises. In-person, hands-on exercises take time and require physical involvement. However, they are much more effective than posters, newsletters, e-learning, or teleconferencing sessions.</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">For a large, geographically distributed organization, it's common to have online self-study e-learning courses. These e-learning courses have exams with required passing scores. Some organizations may require you to pass a security knowledge certification annually. For the adoption of any new security compliance such as GDPR, integrating security practices into existing processes or training programs is still the recommended approach.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">The organization's culture may impact security practices and execution. The term <em class="calibre16">culture</em> may be quite vague, but generally speaking, there are two kinds of security culture. One is the <strong class="calibre4">strict process</strong> type, and the other is <strong class="calibre4">empowering the team</strong>. In the strict process, there is almost no room for flexibility. Once the expected security baselines are defined, they are all compulsory. Detailed security checklists are defined for every project to follow. No violation is allowed. On the other hand, the empowering the team type means the organization only defines general security guidelines, while project teams may define their own security checklists based on project needs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A strict-process culture fits an environment that requires high-level controls, such as the military or banking. There are defined <strong class="calibre4">Standard Operating Procedures</strong> (<span class="calibre6"><strong class="calibre4">SOPs</strong>)</span> and checklists for every security control. The SOP or checklist will greatly reduce the chances of human error. In addition, any exception or failure to meet the security checklist will require the team to submit a formal review. From a security management point of view, this may reduce the need to check with each project team, since the project team will need to initiate a formal review for any security requirements it fails to meet. There is little room for project teams to make any judgment call, which must be done by the security management team. One disadvantage is that project team members may just follow the SOP, and don't know the rationale behind the checklist.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In an empowering-the-team culture, security management only defines guidelines, while each project team may develop a checklist based on the project's needs. The checklists we refer to here are software security requirement features for a development team. It also means an organization-level security policy only defines a few compulsory requirements, without detailed instructions, and allows the team to figure out how to achieve them. It may take time for each project in the beginning and may suffer some trial-and-error mistakes for new start-up teams, but the project team will learn from mistakes, which may still be identified in the testing phase, instead of the design phase. After all, making mistakes and trying different methods of execution are the roots of innovation and creativity.</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, the team may decide on its training needs, instead of a compulsory course list defined by the security management team. Again, the security training decided by the team may not be comprehensive enough, but the team will learn through experience. </p>
<p class="calibre2">There is nothing wrong or right between these two cultures. It all depends on the business status, the needs for compliance, the organizational culture, existing processes, and so on. Some organizations may have a very strict <span class="calibre6">security program, </span>with specific roles, but maybe flexible with other roles. Some organizations may still have a detailed security checklist for every business unit, but allow each project team to judge whether to follow it <span class="calibre6">strictly </span>or not. In the end, fitting into the organizational culture and aligning with business objectives are key to the success of a security assurance program.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">Applying a mature web security framework will help developers to reduce a lot of the design and coding effort required to meet security requirements, since the web security framework itself provides the necessary security controls, such as authentication, authorization, logging, validation, encryption, and session management. To build web services, the followings are some popular open-source Java security frameworks under Apache 2.0 license:</p>
<ul class="calibre10">
<li class="calibre11">Spring Security</li>
<li class="calibre11">Apache Shiro</li>
<li class="calibre11">PicketLink</li>
<li class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre1">Object Access Control</strong> (<span><strong class="calibre1">OACC</strong>)</span> Framework</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Some large organizations may prefer to build or to customize a web security framework for every project to use. No matter what security framework is used, it normally includes the following common <span class="calibre6">security </span>modules.</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img class="alignnone11" src="../images/00025.jpeg"/></p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">An organization-level security assurance program may suggest a list of mature security frameworks, or even provide a common one for a project team to use. After all, one working security framework is always much more effective than a list of security requirement documents.</p>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">We have discussed the culture aspect of how security fits into an organization. Let's now discuss the technical aspect. When it comes to fitting security into DevOps, we are <span class="calibre6">mostly </span>talking about integration with an existing <strong class="calibre4">Continuous Integration</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">CI</strong>) or  <strong class="calibre4">Continuous Delivery</strong> (<span class="calibre6"><strong class="calibre4">CD</strong>) </span>framework. There are various kinds of CI/CD framework. We may focus on how to integrate security with Jenkins, since Jenkins is the hub of the whole CI/CD ecosystem, such as code and commit, build, scan and test, release, and deployment. One typical CI/CD process with security tools integration is shown in the following diagram. Please be aware that security requirements, threat modeling, secure design, and architecture design are not in the diagram, since the security practices of these activities normally tie with the team process, and not directly with a tool, such as Jenkins.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In Joyce's case, she may build security based on the framework provided by the cloud service provider. In John's case, he builds security based on the existing in-house CI/CD framework. No matter which approach is used, the security in the CI/CD process will be similar to one of the examples in the following diagram:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter1"><img class="alignnone12" src="../images/00026.jpeg"/></p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter3"><span>CI/CD process with security tools</span></div>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Avoiding reinventing the wheel, and fitting security into the existing process or framework, are critical success factors for a security assurance program at any stage. A checklist of security requirements helps us understand what is needed. Furthermore, a tool set and framework can help to implement the security of the products. The following table shows another example of how the tools and framework support security in DevOps:</p>

<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we discussed two typical business scenarios for security assurance program. One is building software on top of a third-party cloud service provider, and the other is building complete cloud services on top of your own cloud. Cloud service providers may allow security services to protect the platform and infrastructure, but it's still the cloud service tenant's responsibility to protect the web application and customer data in the cloud. Then, we discussed the adoption of Microsoft SDL and SAMM into security activities in different development and operations phases. For security training, we recommend delivering training based on roles and needs. How security culture impacts the security assurance program was also discussed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, we took security tool integration with CI/CD and the adoption of a web security framework as examples to explain how tools and framework are critical to the success of any security program. In the following chapters, we will look further into how to build a secure architecture, common module, and design principles.</p>
