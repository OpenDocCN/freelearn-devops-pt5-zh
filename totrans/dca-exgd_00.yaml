- en: Microservices and containers have changed the way developers create new applications.
    Microservice architectures allow us to decouple applications in their components,
    and today we have tools that can provide them with orchestrated and seamless interactions.
    Also, containers have changed the deployment artifacts for applications. We have
    moved from binaries to container images. This new development workflow helps developers
    to build applications faster and more securely, and ensures that the final product
    will work as intended, anywhere, without many modifications. Applications deployed
    as containers will follow general code versioning rules, which helps us to keep
    track of component releases and behavior.

- en: This book will introduce microservices and containers and will help us to learn
    the key concepts of these technologies. We will learn how containers work, see
    how networks are implemented in different scenarios, and explore Docker Swarm
    and Kubernetes orchestration strategies and environments. We will also cover all
    the Docker Enterprise components and features required to implement Container
    as a Service platforms in production. All the topics covered in this book, with
    sample questions and detailed answers, will help you to learn the knowledge required
    to pass the official Docker Certified Associate exam.

    and who are preparing for the Docker Certified Associate exam. This book was also
    written as a guide for Docker Enterprise products and serves as an introduction
    to Kubernetes' terminology and features.

    will help you to understand container networking and the use of load balancers
    and proxies to provide a full-featured Container as a Service environment.

- en: The labs in this book are focused on Linux hosts because most current Docker
    Enterprise components are deployed on Linux operating systems. Windows hosts can
    be part of Docker Swarm and Kubernetes clusters, but control planes are deployed
    using Linux hosts.

- en: In order to follow the book's labs and examples, it is recommended to have Docker
    Engine installed on your computer. A set of virtual environments is provided for
    you to allow you to run all the labs without modifying your computer. There are
    also many labs in which you have to deploy clusters, with many nodes involved.
    The labs will deploy virtual machines so you don't have to install many nodes,
    although you can deploy all the labs on your own infrastructure of hosts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The provided virtual environments require Vagrant ([https://www.vagrantup.com/](https://www.vagrantup.com/))
    and VirtualBox ([https://www.virtualbox.org/](https://www.virtualbox.org/)) to
    be installed on your computer. Docker images and software will be downloaded from
    the internet, so internet connectivity is also required. The following table shows
    the computer resources required to run all of the book's labs. You will free up
    resources by destroying environments once all the labs from each section or chapter
    are completed.

    of RAM is required. The labs from chapter 8 and chapter 9 will deploy 4 and 3
    virtual nodes respectively, and more local resources are required. In these cases,
    you will need at least 4 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM on your computer. The Docker Enterprise
    labs require more resources because the platform has quite large CPU and memory
    requirements per virtual node. These labs will run smoothly with at least 8 vCPUs
    and 16 GB of RAM because the Vagrant environment will deploy 4 virtual nodes with
    4 GB of RAM per node.
