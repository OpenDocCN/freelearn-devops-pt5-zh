    In this chapter, we will cover threat inspection and intelligence. This chapter
    focuses on how to identify and prevent known and unknown security threats, such
    as backdoors and injection attacks, using various kinds of log correlation. We
    will introduce the logs that are needed, how those logs are connected, and the
    potential symptoms of attacks. Some open source threat detection will be introduced.
    Finally, we will introduce how to build your own in-house threat intelligence
    system.

- en: The threat landscape is in a constant state of flux, with newly emerging, sophisticated
    technologies. The investment associated with security protection to handle the
    dynamic threat landscape is also becoming huge. Security protection is shifting
    from known threat detection to the early prevention of unknown threats. Big data
    frameworks, machine learning, and threat intelligence are the technologies that
    help to achieve the detection of unknown threats. Correlation analysis of abnormal
    events is key to detecting potential unknown threats.

- en: The objective of network traffic analysis is to identify abnormal internal host
    traffic communications. The challenge posed by network traffic analysis is that
    the amount of data can be overwhelming. In addition, in order to be able to identify
    abnormalities, network administrators will need to perform network traffic profiling,
    such as defining a network communication whitelist or network traffic baseline.
    Although big data and machine learning may help in terms of analysis, it still
    requires IT network administrators to define the normal and abnormal network traffic
    categorization rules.

    due to the availability of logs. For example, dynamic runtime information may
    not be logged in files and the original process used to drop a suspicious file
    may not be recorded. Therefore, it is always recommended to install a host IDS/IPS
    such as OSSEC (Open Source HIDS SEcurity) or host antivirus software as the first
    line of defense against malware. Once the host IDS/IPS or antivirus software is
    in place, threat intelligence and big data analysis are supplementary, helping
    us to understand the overall host's security posture and any known **Indicators
