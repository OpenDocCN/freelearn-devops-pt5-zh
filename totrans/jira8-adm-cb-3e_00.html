<p class="NormalPACKT">Atlassian Jira is an enterprise-issue tracker system. One of its key strengths is its ability to adapt to the needs of the organization from the frontend user interface to provide a platform for third-party apps to extend its capabilities. However, understanding its flexibility and picking the right apps can often be a daunting task for many administrators. Learning how to take advantage of Jira's power while keeping the overall design simple and clean is important to the success of the implementation and future growth.</p>
<p class="NormalPACKT">With this book, you can make full use of useful recipes with real-life Jira administration challenges, solutions, and examples. Each recipe contains easy-to-follow, step-by-step instructions and illustrations from the actual Jira application.</p>
