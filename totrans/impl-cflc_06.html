<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Discovering different roles in a software development project</h1>
<p>In a remote software<a id="_idIndexMarker449"/> development team, there are several roles, known as “personas” or “stakeholders,” each with their own unique needs and ways they<a id="_idIndexMarker450"/> can benefit from a Confluence space. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Software developers</strong>: Being at the core of the team, software developers create and test the code<a id="_idIndexMarker451"/> that makes up your software product. They <a id="_idIndexMarker452"/>need easy access to technical specifications, design documents, coding standards, and project plans. They also need a way to communicate effectively with other team members. A Confluence space can serve as a central repository for all this information, making it easy for developers to find what they need. They can <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>also use Confluence’s commenting features <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>to ask questions, discuss problems, and share ideas.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Product managers</strong>: These individuals are responsible for guiding product development, making <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>decisions about what features to include, and prioritizing tasks. They need a holistic view of project progress, as well as the ability<a id="_idIndexMarker456"/> to drill down into details when necessary. Confluence can help with this need through pages dedicated to project plans, progress tracking, and task lists. Product managers can also use Confluence to communicate their decisions and gather feedback from the team.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Quality </strong><strong class="bold">a</strong><strong class="bold">ssurance (QA) engineers</strong>: QA engineers test the software for document bugs. They<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> need access to test plans, bug reports, and sometimes design documents or technical specs. They can use <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>Confluence pages dedicated to test plans and bug tracking. QA engineers can also use Confluence to report bugs, discuss them with the team, and track their resolution.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">DevOps engineers</strong>: They<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> focus on the systems and processes that support the development team, such as version control systems, <strong class="bold">continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD)</strong> pipelines, and infrastructure. DevOps engineers<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> need access to technical documentation and system specs. At this point, Confluence can serve as a central source of information, to document their processes and procedures, which is crucial for effective DevOps practices.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">UX/UI designers</strong>: They are <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>responsible for user experience and interface <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>design, having the need to <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>share their design and gather feedback. In this case, UX/UI designers can benefit from a Confluence<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> space where they share their material, discuss it with the team, and track changes and updates.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Creating a single source of truth for a software development project</h1>
<p>Creating a<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> single source of truth on Confluence for a software project involves organizing and centralizing all relevant information in a structured and accessible manner. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to achieve this goal:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Define the structure</strong>: Plan how you will organize your Confluence space to reflect the structure of your software project. Consider creating a hierarchy of pages and sub-pages that align with different aspects of the project, such as a project overview, requirements, design, development, testing, and documentation.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Project overview</strong>: Create a page dedicated to providing an overview of the project, including the objectives, scope, stakeholders, and timeline. This page can serve as a North Star for team members and stakeholders to understand the project’s context.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Requirements</strong>: Document the project requirements in detail. Use Confluence’s formatting options to structure and categorize the requirements. Also, consider using tables, bullet points, or checklists to better organize and track requirements, and make sure the material is easy to follow.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Design and architecture</strong>: Create pages to capture the design and architecture of the software. Include diagrams, wireframes, UI mockups, and any other visual representations that help communicate the design decisions. Provide explanations and annotations to clarify the design choices made.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Development</strong>: Use Confluence to track the development progress and make updates visible. Create pages or use templates to document user stories, development tasks, and backlog items. Use tables or task management macros to track task status, assignees, and due dates. Encourage team members to provide regular updates on their progress.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Testing</strong>: Document<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> the testing strategy, test plans, and test results within Confluence. Create pages to outline the testing approach, define test cases, and track test results. Include any relevant screenshots or logs to provide context for failed tests and bug reports.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Documentation</strong>: Use Confluence as a central hub for all project-related documentation, which includes technical documentation, API references, user manuals, and release notes. Ensure that the documentation is up to date and easily accessible to team members and stakeholders.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Collaboration and communication</strong>: Leverage Confluence’s collaborative features to encourage team members to share their insights, ask questions, and provide feedback. Utilize commenting, @mentions, and notifications to facilitate discussions and keep everyone informed.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Version control and history</strong>: Use Confluence’s version control capabilities. Track changes in pages, review them, and revert to previous versions to maintain a progress record if needed. This feature also boosts transparency through the project’s evolution.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Promote adoption and governance</strong>: Encourage team members to use Confluence consistently. Provide training and support to ensure everyone understands how to use Confluence effectively and master the best practices. Establish governance practices to ensure the accuracy, quality, and currency of the information in the<a id="_idIndexMarker467"/> Confluence space.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, you can create a reliable single source of truth on Confluence for your remote software project. These steps will assist your team in streamlining collaboration, improving transparency, and ensuring that team members are aligned and working with the most up-to-date project information.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Discovering the software project space template</h1>
<p>There is a<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> ready-made space template on Confluence. In it, you can have Confluence ready for your project. In this section, we’ll review this template and discuss the content you can work on.</p>

<p>We are now ready to discover each of the four pages.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Product requirements template</h2>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/><strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong> template<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> in Confluence is a crucial tool for remote teams working on software development. For a remote team, clearly defined product requirements are essential to ensure that everyone is aligned on the project’s goals, features, and constraints, despite being physically apart. It provides a single source of truth that everyone can refer to, minimizing misunderstandings and communication gaps. For a software development team, well-defined product requirements are the foundation upon which the entire project is built. It helps in setting clear expectations for what needs to be developed, the features and functionalities that are essential, and the constraints that need to be considered. The <strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong> template in Confluence provides a structured format to document all these details, making it easier for the team to understand and work toward the common goal. By centralizing all the project-related information in an easily accessible location, Confluence’s <strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong> template not only streamlines the development process but also fosters better collaboration and communication among remote teams.</p>
<p>As with almost all <a id="_idIndexMarker474"/>templates on Confluence, Atlassian has included <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>a table with the basic information of the document as the first content in this template. You can see this table in the next screenshot.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_06_05_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.5 – Product requirements template</p>
<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>can see in the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> screenshot, you can add your teammates to the <strong class="bold">Document owner</strong>, <strong class="bold">Designer</strong>, <strong class="bold">Tech lead</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Technical writers</strong> fields. You can customize this table as you wish.</p>
<h3>The Objective section</h3>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Objective</strong> section<a id="_idIndexMarker478"/> in the <strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong><a id="_idIndexMarker479"/> template is a pivotal element when documenting product requirements. Clearly defining the objectives is crucial for several reasons. First, it sets the direction for the entire project by outlining the goals that the product is intended to achieve. This helps in aligning the team and ensuring that everyone is working toward the same end goal. Second, it provides a basis for decision-making throughout the project. When faced with different options or when making trade-offs, the objectives serve as a guide to making decisions that are in the best interest of the product. It is important to note that objectives are different from requirements. Objectives are the overarching goals that the product aims to achieve, whereas requirements are the specific functionalities and features that the product must have to meet those objectives. For example, an objective could be “Improve user engagement on the platform,” while a requirement could be “Implement a recommendation algorithm to suggest personalized content to users.” By clearly defining the objectives and differentiating them from the requirements, the Product requirements template in Confluence helps in creating a well-structured and comprehensive document that serves as a roadmap for the entire development process. You can put the project objectives on your page. Here are some <a id="_idIndexMarker480"/>objective<a id="_idIndexMarker481"/> ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Develop a robust and scalable enterprise chat program</strong>: The primary objective is to create a chat program that meets the needs of businesses, providing secure and efficient communication channels for employees.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Ensure seamless integration with existing enterprise systems</strong>: The chat program should seamlessly integrate with other enterprise systems commonly used by companies, such as email clients, project management tools, and document collaboration platforms. This integration will enhance productivity and streamline workflows for users.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Deliver a user-friendly and intuitive interface</strong>: The chat program should have a user-friendly interface that is intuitive and easy to navigate. Users should be able to quickly adapt to the platform, minimizing the learning curve.</li>
</ul>
<p>After completing the <strong class="bold">Objective</strong> section, let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>review the next three<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> sections of the template: <strong class="bold">Success metrics</strong>, <strong class="bold">Assumptions</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Milestones</strong>. You can see these three sections in the next screenshot.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_06_06_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.6 – Success metrics, Assumptions, and Milestones</p>
<p>Now, let’s examine the three sections seen in the previous screenshot one by one and give realistic examples of each.</p>
<h3>The Success metrics section</h3>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Success metrics</strong> section<a id="_idIndexMarker484"/> in the <strong class="bold">Product </strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker485"/></strong><strong class="bold">requirements</strong> template is another crucial component that should be clearly defined when documenting product requirements. Specifying success metrics is essential as it provides a clear definition of what success looks like for the project. It sets the criteria that will be used to evaluate the success of the product once it is developed and implemented. This not only helps in setting clear expectations for the team but also provides a basis for evaluating the product post-implementation.</p>
<p>Success metrics are different from both objectives and requirements. While objectives define the overarching goals of the product, and requirements specify the functionalities and features needed to achieve those objectives, success metrics define the criteria that will be used to evaluate whether the objectives have been successfully met. For example, if the objective is “Improve user engagement on the platform,” a requirement could be “Implement a recommendation algorithm to suggest personalized content to users,” and a success metric could be “Increase the average session duration of users by 20%.”</p>
<p>By clearly defining the success metrics, along with the objectives and requirements, the <strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong> template in Confluence helps in creating a comprehensive document that not only guides the development process but also sets the criteria for evaluating the success of the product post-implementation.</p>
<p>Here, we provide three sample assumptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Performance and scalability</strong>: The chat program should be capable of handling a large number of users and messages without significant performance degradation. It should be able to accommodate the needs of growing organizations and scale accordingly.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Integration success rate</strong>: The success criteria for integration can be defined by the percentage of successful integrations with various enterprise systems. A high integration success rate indicates that the chat program effectively integrates with commonly used tools, facilitating seamless data exchange and collaboration.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">User satisfaction and adoption</strong>: User feedback and satisfaction surveys can be used to measure the success of the user interface. High user satisfaction scores and <a id="_idIndexMarker486"/>positive feedback show <a id="_idIndexMarker487"/>that the interface is intuitive and meets the needs of users, leading to higher adoption rates within the organization.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Assumptions section</h3>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Assumptions</strong> section<a id="_idIndexMarker488"/> in the<a id="_idIndexMarker489"/> <strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong> template plays an often underappreciated but vital role in the planning and execution of a project. Assumptions are essentially the conditions or facts that the team assumes to be true for the project to move forward successfully. These could be anything from the availability of certain technologies to market conditions or user behavior.</p>
<p>Clearly listing out assumptions is crucial for several reasons. First, it helps identify areas of risk early in the project, allowing for proactive risk management strategies. For instance, if an assumption doesn’t hold true down the line, recognizing it early could save both time and resources. Also, it provides a basis for clarity and mutual understanding among team members and stakeholders. Everyone involved can refer back to these assumptions to align their efforts or to validate the viability of the objectives and requirements set forth.</p>
<p>By explicitly stating assumptions in the <strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong> template on Confluence, you can create a more robust roadmap for your project, one that accounts for potential risks and sets a common understanding for all parties involved.</p>
<p>Here, we provide three sample assumptions:</p>
<h4>Assumption 1</h4>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker490"/>target companies have a need for an enterprise chat program.</p>
<h4>Rationale1</h4>
<p>Before <a id="_idIndexMarker491"/>embarking on the development of the chat program, it is essential to assume that there is a market demand for such a solution. Conducting market research or gathering feedback from potential clients can help validate this assumption.</p>
<h4>Assumption 2</h4>
<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker492"/> development team has the necessary technical expertise to build the chat program.</p>
<h4>Rationale 2</h4>
<p>Assuming<a id="_idIndexMarker493"/> that the development team possesses the required skills and knowledge to develop a robust and scalable chat program is crucial. This assumption considers the team’s proficiency in relevant programming languages, frameworks, and technologies.</p>
<h4>Assumption 3</h4>
<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker494"/> integration with existing enterprise systems is feasible.</p>
<h4>Rationale 3</h4>
<p>Assuming <a id="_idIndexMarker495"/>that integrating the chat program with other enterprise systems commonly used by companies is technically feasible involves considering factors such as available APIs, documentation, and the compatibility of the systems to ensure smooth data exchange and collaboration.</p>
<h3>The Milestones section</h3>
<p>A milestone in the context of<a id="_idIndexMarker496"/> project <a id="_idIndexMarker497"/>management refers to a significant point or event in the project timeline. These are notable moments that signify some form of progress or achievement in the project. For example, completing the design phase, finishing the first prototype, or passing a critical review can all be considered milestones. Milestones are different from objectives as they serve as markers along the road to achieving an objective. While an objective is a broad and overarching goal that the project aims to achieve, a milestone is a specific and measurable point that marks progress toward that objective.</p>
<p>Clearly defining milestones in the <strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong> template is essential for several reasons. First, it helps in tracking progress during the project execution. By setting specific milestones, the team can monitor whether the project is moving as planned or whether any adjustments are needed. Second, it helps in setting clear expectations and keeping the team motivated. Achieving a milestone provides a sense of accomplishment and helps maintain momentum throughout the project. Lastly, it assists in effective communication with stakeholders by providing clear indicators of progress.</p>
<p>In <a id="_idIndexMarker498"/>summary, by clearly specifying <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>milestones in the <strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong> template on Confluence, you can facilitate better project tracking, team motivation, and stakeholder communication, all of which are crucial for the successful execution of a project.</p>
<p>You can define your milestones in this section, where we provide three samples:</p>
<h4>Milestone 1: Project Initiation</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Start</strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker500"/></strong><strong class="bold"> Date</strong>: June 1, 2023</li>
<li><strong class="bold">End Date</strong>: June 15, 2023</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: This milestone marks the official start of the project and includes activities such as project planning, team formation, and setting up the development environment. Key deliverables may include a project charter, initial project plan, and team roles/responsibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Milestone 2: Prototype Development</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Start </strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker501"/></strong><strong class="bold">Date</strong>: June 16, 2023</li>
<li><strong class="bold">End Date</strong>: August 15, 2023</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: This milestone focuses on developing a functional prototype of the enterprise chat program. The development team will work on implementing core features, designing the user interface, and conducting initial testing. By the end of this milestone, a working prototype should be available for evaluation and <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Milestone 3: Beta Release and Testing</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Start </strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker503"/></strong><strong class="bold">Date</strong>: August 16, 2023</li>
<li><strong class="bold">End Date</strong>: October 15, 2023</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: This milestone involves refining the prototype based on user feedback and conducting comprehensive testing to ensure stability and usability. The development team will address any identified issues, optimize performance, and make the necessary adjustments based on user requirements. The beta version of the chat program will be released to a select group of users for further testing and feedback.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Requirements section</h3>
<p>Requirements<a id="_idIndexMarker504"/> are specific, detailed<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> instructions or needs that must be fulfilled for a project or product to be considered complete. They are the essential functionalities, features, and constraints that define the final output. Requirements differ from objectives in that objectives are overarching goals or outcomes that the project aims to achieve, whereas requirements are the detailed specifications necessary to accomplish these objectives. For example, an objective might be to develop a mobile application that helps users manage their daily tasks, while a requirement would specify that the application should allow users to create, edit, and delete tasks.</p>
<p>It is crucial to clearly define requirements in the <strong class="bold">Product requirements</strong> document for several reasons. First, well-defined requirements set clear expectations for the team, helping to prevent misunderstandings or conflicts later in the project. Second, they serve as a basis for estimating the time and resources needed for the project, which is essential for planning and budgeting. Lastly, clear requirements are necessary for testing and validation purposes, as they serve as the criteria against which the final product will be evaluated. When writing requirements, it is important they are <strong class="bold">specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART)</strong>. Also, involve all relevant stakeholders, including end users, to <a id="_idIndexMarker506"/>ensure that all perspectives are considered and that the final product will <a id="_idIndexMarker507"/>meet the needs of all parties involved.</p>
<p>In the next screenshot, you can see the three requirement examples we provided.</p>

Thus, you will have a cohesive and intuitive user interface that enhances user satisfaction and engagement.</p>
<h3>The Open Questions section</h3>
<p>As you manage the project, you and <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>your team <a id="_idIndexMarker515"/>will have a lot of questions in mind. It is very important to identify these questions and record them on Confluence. As questions get answered, you can add answers to this section of the page. Having questions and answers transparently visible to the entire project team is invaluable to members of your remote team. In the next screenshot, we’ve given you three sample questions about the project.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.8 – Open Questions section</p>
<p>As seen in the previous screenshot, some questions may not get answered right away. It is important that questions that remain unanswered stay visible to the entire team. We also recommend that you record the date the questions were answered.</p>
<h3>The Out of Scope section</h3>
<p><strong class="bold">Out of Scope</strong> <a id="_idIndexMarker516"/>refers to any<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> elements, features, or functionalities that will not be addressed or included in the current phase of a project. Clearly defining what is out of scope is as crucial as specifying what is in scope because it sets clear boundaries for the project and helps manage stakeholders’ expectations. It also helps to avoid “scope creep,” which occurs when additional work is added to the project without proper analysis, documentation, and approval, leading to delays, increased costs, and other potential problems. When defining what is out of scope, it is important to be as detailed and explicit as possible and to involve all relevant stakeholders to ensure that all perspectives are considered and that there is a mutual understanding and agreement on what will and will not be included in the project.</p>
<p>Identifying and documenting out-of-scope elements is particularly important for remote teams, as it helps to prevent misunderstandings and conflicts that can arise when team members are not co-located and may have different assumptions or interpretations about the project. Remote teams can identify out-of-scope elements by conducting virtual brainstorming sessions, using online collaboration tools, and continuously communicating and sharing feedback throughout the project. This helps to ensure everyone has a clear and shared understanding of the project boundaries, which is essential for coordinating work, managing expectations, and ultimately delivering a successful project.</p>
<p>In the following screenshot, you can see the sample contents that can be written to the <strong class="bold">Out of </strong><strong class="bold">Scope</strong> section.</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.9 – Out of Scope section</p>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>out-of-scope topics you see in the <a id="_idIndexMarker519"/>previous screenshot will be much more numerous in a real project. You can use any format you want to record these topics. The important thing is that it is an easy-to-understand, sustainable format.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>The Meeting Notes template</h2>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/><strong class="bold">Meeting Notes</strong> template in <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>Confluence is an incredibly useful tool designed to optimize the way teams document and share information discussed during meetings. This template serves multiple purposes; it helps in organizing the meeting agenda beforehand, recording key discussions, decisions, and action items during the meeting, and sharing this information with team members after the meeting. Having a structured document that includes all the vital details discussed during a meeting is crucial for keeping all team members aligned, tracking progress, and ensuring accountability. It eliminates the chances of any misunderstanding or miscommunication and provides a clear and concise record of what was discussed, what decisions were made, and what the next steps that need to be taken are.</p>
<p>Moreover, the <strong class="bold">Meeting Notes</strong> template is highly customizable, allowing teams to tailor it to fit their specific needs and meeting formats. It usually includes sections for meeting attendees, agenda, discussions, decisions, and action items. After the meeting, the notes can be easily shared with the entire team, and because Confluence is a collaborative platform, team members can add comments, ask questions, and even update the document as required. This interactive and dynamic nature of the template ensures that everyone stays informed and engaged, even if they were unable to attend the meeting in person. Ultimately, the <strong class="bold">Meeting Notes</strong> template in Confluence is an essential tool for any team seeking to improve their communication, collaboration, and overall efficiency.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Meeting Notes</strong> template in Confluence consists of six sections:</p>
<ul>
<li>Date</li>
<li>Participants</li>
<li>Goals</li>
<li>Discussion topics</li>
<li>Action items</li>
<li>Discussions</li>
</ul>
<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>use these sections as they are or modify them according to your<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> preference. Now, we will explain how you can fill out the meeting template for a remote team with concrete examples.</p>
<h3>Date</h3>
<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker524"/> section, you can provide the date and time of the meeting: 29.5.2023, 19.00 - 21.00 UTC.</p>
<p>Note that including the time zone would be good practice, especially for remote teams.</p>
<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>You can include <a id="_idIndexMarker525"/>information on the participants of the meeting in this section, such as this:</p>
<ul>
<li>John Smith – <a href="mailto:john.smith@example.com">john.smith@example.com</a></li>
<li>Emma Johnson – <a href="mailto:emma.johnson@example.com">emma.johnson@example.com</a></li>
<li>Michael <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>Davis – <a href="mailto:michael.davis@example.com">michael.davis@example.com</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>Goals</h3>
<p>Every meeting <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>has one or several objectives. It is critical to reflect on these objectives and make them visible to everyone for an effective meeting. This way, the entire team will be aligned on the meeting objectives; these could be goals, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review the progress of the chat program development and discuss any challenges or roadblocks</li>
<li>Brainstorm and make decisions regarding the user interface design and interaction patterns</li>
<li>Assign tasks and responsibilities for the upcoming development sprint</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, this meeting has three objectives, and they are visible to the entire team.</p>
<h3>Discussion topics</h3>
<p>It is a good idea to<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> identify the discussion topics in advance. This way, you can save valuable time. You can also write notes in the table regarding the meeting topics, and define a time frame for each presenter. In the next screenshot, you can find examples of discussion topics we have prepared for you.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_06_10_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.10 – Discussion topics</p>
<p>As you can see in the previous screenshot, the duration in minutes, the name of the topic, the person responsible for the topic, and the notes on the topic are clearly defined for each discussion topic. You can add other information if you wish. We recommend that you update this table, which you created before the meeting, and fill it out to a<a id="_idIndexMarker529"/> large extent during and after the meeting.</p>
<h3>Decisions</h3>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Decisions</strong> section<a id="_idIndexMarker530"/> of the <strong class="bold">Meeting Notes</strong> template in Confluence is a critical component as it captures all the significant decisions made during a meeting. For remote teams, managing decisions made during a meeting is crucial as it ensures everyone is aligned and aware of the path forward. Documenting these decisions in the meeting notes is important as it creates a permanent record that can be referred to later, ensures accountability as it is clear who is responsible for what, and helps in keeping all team members, including those who could not attend the meeting, updated about the critical decisions made. When recording decisions, it is important to be clear and concise, specify who made the decision, and outline any next steps or actions that need to be taken as a result. Ideally, decisions should be recorded as they are made during the meeting by the designated note-taker – usually the person who organized the meeting or a designated scribe.</p>
<p>Recording decisions promptly during the meeting ensures that no critical information is lost or misunderstood, and it allows for any necessary clarification or additional discussion to occur in real time. It is the responsibility of the person designated to take the meeting notes to ensure that all decisions are accurately recorded and shared with the team as soon as possible after the meeting. This ensures that everyone has a clear and shared understanding of the decisions made and the next steps to be taken, which is crucial for the effective functioning of a remote team.</p>
<p>You can find<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> examples of three decisions taken during the meeting in the next screenshot.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_06_11_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.11 – Decision log</p>
<p>As seen, we use Confluence’s decision tool to record each decision. We have seen this tool earlier in the book. Decisions recorded using this tool have an icon that looks like a green arrow at the beginning.</p>
<p>Let’s <a id="_idIndexMarker532"/>remember that there is another macro called Decision Report, a macro that will help you summarize decisions from different pages in Confluence.</p>
<h3>Action items</h3>
<p>During the meeting, your<a id="_idIndexMarker533"/> team may define certain tasks to be completed. To ensure that these tasks are not overlooked, you can add them as action items in the <strong class="bold">Action </strong><strong class="bold">i</strong><strong class="bold">tems</strong> section of the meeting document.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_06_12_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.12 – Action items</p>
<p>As you can see, three tasks were decided upon in the meeting. Two of these tasks have been completed, while one is still pending completion.</p>
<p>It’s also a<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> good practice to use the status macro to present statuses next to actions. The status macro is shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_06_13_B16861.jpg"/>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.14 – Decision basic information</p>
<p>As seen in the <a id="_idIndexMarker541"/>previous screenshot, this template advises us to clearly transcribe many features related to big decisions. Examples of these characteristics are the status of the decision, the effect of the decision, and the people who are effective in making the decision. You can also add additional<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> information to the fields you see in the figure. Here are two examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Decision impact</strong>: Explanation of the potential impact of the decision, stakeholders, and overall success</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Decision criteria</strong>: List of the specific criteria or factors that will be considered in making the decision, such as cost, scalability, security, user experience, and so on</li>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.15 – Options considered section</p>
<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker548"/> considering alternatives for the decision related to the chat application, you can evaluate the three options seen in the previous table.</p>
<p>These options can be evaluated when making the decision regarding the chat application. The final choice will depend on factors such as project requirements, budget, timeline, scalability needs, and the development team’s expertise and resources.</p>
<h4>Action items</h4>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Action</strong><strong class="bold"><a id="_idIndexMarker549"/></strong><strong class="bold"> </strong><strong class="bold">i</strong><strong class="bold">tems</strong> section of the meeting template is one of the most critical parts of the document. During a meeting, various topics are discussed, decisions are made, and often, specific tasks or actions need to be assigned to individuals or teams. This is where the <strong class="bold">Action </strong><strong class="bold">i</strong><strong class="bold">tems</strong> section comes into play. It is a dedicated space for listing all the tasks or actions that are required to be taken following the meeting. Each action item typically includes a description of the task, the person responsible for completing it, and a deadline for its completion. By clearly defining and assigning these tasks during the meeting, it ensures that everyone is aware of their responsibilities, and there is accountability for completing them. It also helps in tracking the progress of these tasks after the meeting, as team members can update the status of their action items as they work on them. Ultimately, the <strong class="bold">Action </strong><strong class="bold">i</strong><strong class="bold">tems</strong> section is essential for transforming the discussions and decisions made during the meeting into concrete actions and ensuring that the necessary steps are taken to move the project forward.</p>
<p>This section outlines the actionable steps or tasks resulting from the decisions. Consider including specific action items that need to be taken based on the chosen alternative. For example, it could involve conducting further research, performing compatibility testing, or implementing the selected solution.</p>
<p>In the next screenshot, you can see three action item examples.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_06_16_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 6.16 – Action items</p>
<p>In the preceding screenshot, three tasks to be carried out have been added to the document as action items. An empty square signifies that the task has not been completed yet, while a filled square indicates that the task has been completed.</p>
<h4>Outcome</h4>
<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker550"/>section describes the outcome of the decision-making process and the chosen option. Summarize the outcome of the decision-making process, including the option that was chosen and the rationale behind it. Also, explain how the selected alternative aligns with the project goals and requirements.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<p><em class="italic">After carefully considering the available options and evaluating their pros and cons, the decision has been made to select React and Node.js as the technology stack for the chat application.

<p>Once you<a id="_idIndexMarker554"/> mastered the software project space template in Confluence, you can adapt it to your needs. Now, it’s time for customizing your Confluence template.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Customizing Confluence’s software development template for project-based needs</h1>
<p>Confluence<a id="_idIndexMarker555"/> provides a ready-to-use software development template that offers useful content for software management projects. However, in most cases, it is necessary to tailor these pages to align them with the specific requirements of your project.</p>
<p>Now, we are ready to go through the process of customizing Confluence’s software development template, ensuring you have a well tailored and effective project management environment:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Assess your project requirements</strong>: Start by understanding your project’s unique requirements. Identify the specific information, processes, and workflows that are essential for your software development project. Consider aspects such as project documentation, team collaboration, task management, reporting, and any other specific needs.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Review Confluence’s software development template</strong>: Take a close look at Confluence’s software development template, which typically includes pages for project overview, requirements, design documentation, release planning, testing, and more. Assess each page’s relevance to your project and determine which ones can be utilized as is and which ones require customization.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Customize existing pages</strong>: For the pages that need customization, edit and tailor the content to align with your project’s specific requirements. Add or remove sections, modify <a id="_idIndexMarker556"/>headings, and adjust the content to reflect your project’s terminology, processes, and standards. Consider incorporating specific guidelines, templates, or examples that are relevant to your project.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Create new pages</strong>: If the template does not include pages that address your project’s unique needs, create new pages from scratch. Identify the areas where additional documentation or information is required, such as architecture diagrams, API references, user guides, or sprint planning. Create new pages to accommodate these specific needs and populate them with relevant content.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Implement project-specific workflows</strong>: If your project follows specific workflows, such as Agile or DevOps, adapt the existing template or create new pages to reflect these workflows. Customize the project planning, task tracking, and reporting sections to align with your chosen methodology. Include details on user stories, sprints, backlog management, and other relevant information specific to your project’s workflow.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Collaborative spaces and permissions</strong>: Consider creating dedicated spaces within Confluence for different teams, stakeholders, or project phases. Set appropriate permissions to control access to sensitive information and ensure that team members have the right level of access and visibility based on their roles and responsibilities.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Iterative improvement</strong>: Keep in mind that customization is an iterative process. As your project progresses and evolves, regularly review and update the customized pages to reflect the latest project status, changes, and requirements. Encourage team members to contribute and provide feedback to continually <a id="_idIndexMarker557"/>improve the content and make it more relevant and useful.</li>
</ol>
<p>You are now ready to effectively customize the Confluence software development template to match your specific needs. The result you’ll get will be a well-structured project management environment that includes the necessary information, processes, and collaboration features required for the success of your software development project.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Example content you can add to your space</h2>
<p>Here is some content you could add to your space.</p>
<h3>Home page</h3>
<p>This is the gateway to your team’s work, which should be engaging and intuitive. You can include these contents<a id="_idIndexMarker558"/> in your home page:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Welcome section</strong>: A brief overview of the team’s purpose and goals, which could be especially helpful for new members</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Quick links</strong>: A section with links to frequently accessed pages such as project boards, the team directory, coding guidelines, or even external resources such as the company’s intranet or a link to the team’s communication platform</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Calendar</strong>: An embedded calendar that shows upcoming milestones, sprint timelines, team meetings, or even team members’ time off. This can help everyone stay <a id="_idIndexMarker559"/>aware of important dates.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Project documentation</h3>
<p>This is the heart of your team’s work. Organizing this content effectively can save a lot of valuable time. Here, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker560"/>include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Project pages</strong>: Each project your team works on could have its own dedicated page, with sub-pages for different aspects of the project such as project plans, design documents, test results, and so on. Each page could include text, images, diagrams, or even embedded videos explaining complex concepts.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Version history</strong>: Confluence automatically tracks changes made to each page, allowing you to see who made what changes and when. This can be very helpful in maintaining accountability and transparency.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Team collaboration and communication</h3>
<p>Here, you can include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Discussion pages</strong>: These can be used for brainstorming, problem-solving, or decision-making. For <a id="_idIndexMarker561"/>example, you might have a discussion page dedicated to addressing bugs, where team members can post about any issues they encounter and discuss possible solutions.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Notifications</strong>: Confluence allows users to watch pages or entire spaces. When a user watches a page, they receive email notifications about comments, page edits, and other updates. Encourage your team members to use this feature to stay up to date with areas of the project they’re interested in or responsible for.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Labels</strong>: Using labels effectively can make it much easier to find related content. For example, you might label all pages related to a specific project with the project’s name <a id="_idIndexMarker562"/>or use a “meeting notes” label for all meeting notes.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Structure and updates</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Page hierarchy</strong>: Confluence <a id="_idIndexMarker563"/>allows you to structure pages in a hierarchical fashion, with parent pages and child pages. This can make it much easier to navigate the space. For example, you might have a parent page for a project, with child pages for the project plan, design documents, and other related content.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Regular updates</strong>: Assign a person or a team with the responsibility of regularly updating the space. This can involve adding new information, updating existing pages, and archiving old content, ensuring that your Confluence space remains a reliable source of current information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, please note that the key to a successful Confluence space is not just setting it up effectively, but also maintaining and updating it regularly. It should evolve with your team’s needs over time.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Using Confluence as a hub with external tools</h2>
<p>To configure Confluence as a hub for <a id="_idIndexMarker564"/>external systems, such as SaaS applications, you can utilize various integration capabilities and features available in Confluence. Here’s a general guide on how to configure Confluence as a hub for external systems:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong class="bold">Identify integration needs</strong>: Determine which external systems or SaaS applications you want to integrate with Confluence. Consider the specific use cases and functionalities you want to achieve through these integrations. For example, you might want to embed content from external systems, display real-time data, or synchronize information between Confluence and other tools.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Explore </strong><strong class="bold">the Atlassian</strong><strong class="bold"> Marketplace</strong>: Browse the Atlassian Marketplace, which offers a wide range of apps and integrations for Confluence. Look for apps that provide integration capabilities with your target external systems. Evaluate the available options based on functionality, user ratings, reviews, and compatibility with your Confluence instance.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Install and configure integration apps</strong>: Once you have selected the appropriate integration apps, install them in your Confluence instance by following the provided instructions. Configure the integration settings based on the requirements of the external systems you want to connect with. This typically involves providing authentication credentials, API keys, or configuring webhooks. It’s good practice to test apps first using a sandbox environment without affecting your live Confluence environment. Remember that the sandbox option is only available in the Premium plan.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Embed external content</strong>: Many integration apps allow you to embed content from external systems directly within Confluence pages. For example, you can embed live dashboards, reports, or project boards from SaaS applications such as Jira, Trello, or Figma. This provides a centralized view of relevant information without needing to switch between different tools.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Display real-time data</strong>: Some integration apps offer the ability to display real-time data from external systems in Confluence. This can include metrics, status updates, or notifications. Configure the integration app to fetch and display the relevant data within Confluence, providing team members with up-to-date information without leaving the Confluence environment.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Bi-directional data synchronization</strong>: If you need to keep data synchronized between Confluence and external systems, look for integration apps that support bi-directional data synchronization. This can be useful when, for example, you want to sync Confluence pages with project documentation stored in a SaaS application or <a id="_idIndexMarker565"/>update Confluence content based on changes made in an external system.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Customize Confluence with macros and APIs</strong>: Confluence offers a variety of macros and APIs that allow for further customization and integration possibilities. Leverage these features to develop custom solutions or build specific integrations tailored to your unique needs. You can use Confluence’s REST API, webhooks, or develop your own apps using the Confluence Connect framework.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Test and monitor integrations</strong>: After configuring the integrations, thoroughly<a id="_idIndexMarker566"/> test their functionality to ensure they are working as expected. Monitor the integrations over time to identify any issues, such as API compatibility, performance, or security concerns. Regularly update the integration apps and Confluence versions to ensure compatibility and access to new features and improvements.</li>
</ol>
<p>By following these steps, it’s possible to configure Confluence as a hub for external systems, allowing you to centralize information, streamline workflows, and enhance collaboration by integrating and leveraging data from various SaaS applications within Confluence.</p>

Within Jira, set up a project and define its elements, such as epics, user stories, tasks, and sprints. Establish a clear connection between the Confluence space and the Jira project.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Link Confluence pages to Jira issues</strong>: Integrate Confluence and Jira to establish a seamless connection and enhance the power of each platform. Link Confluence pages to relevant Jira issues, epics, or user stories to allow your team members to easily access associated documentation directly from Jira and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Use Jira for task management</strong>: Leverage Jira’s issue-tracking and task-management capabilities to track and assign work. Create user stories, break them down into tasks, and assign them to team members. Use Jira’s agile boards (Scrum or Kanban) to visualize the progress of tasks and manage workflows. Update task statuses, log work, and track progress in Jira.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Document project information in Confluence</strong>: Use Confluence to create and maintain project documentation such as requirements, meeting notes, and decision logs. Use Confluence’s rich formatting options, templates, and collaborative editing mode to create and update content. Embed Jira dashboards or boards in Confluence pages to provide a visual overview of the project’s progress.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Use Jira macros in Confluence</strong>: Make the most of Jira macros available in Confluence to<a id="_idIndexMarker568"/> display relevant Jira data within Confluence pages. Embed Jira filters, agile boards, or issue lists in Confluence pages to showcase real-time project information, task statuses, and progress to keep team members informed without switching between tools.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Track discussions and decisions</strong>: Utilize Confluence’s commenting and collaboration features to facilitate discussions and decision-making. Encourage team members to leave comments, provide feedback, and ask questions on Confluence pages. Use @mentions to notify relevant stakeholders and keep everyone engaged.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Track documentation changes</strong>: Leverage Confluence’s version control capabilities to keep a record of changes and enable effortless reverting to previous versions if needed. Encourage team members to review and update Confluence pages regularly to ensure all documentation remains accurate and up to date.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cross-reference between Confluence and Jira</strong>: Establish cross-referencing between Confluence and Jira to maintain traceability. Link Confluence<a id="_idIndexMarker569"/> pages to related Jira issues and vice versa, allowing team members to easily navigate between documentation and task management, ensuring they have the necessary context and information.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Regularly review and update</strong>: Check for inconsistencies, outdated information, or missing documentation in both tools. Encourage team members to contribute to Confluence and Jira, ensuring that all knowledge and project statuses <a id="_idIndexMarker570"/>reflect the most accurate versions.</li>
