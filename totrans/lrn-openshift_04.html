<p class="calibre2">In the previous chapter, we briefly covered Container Runtime and Container Runtime Interface basics, followed by what CRI-O is and how it works. Finally, we installed a Kubernetes cluster with CRI-O as a Container Runtime Interface and ran a few simple commands to verify that Kubernetes was working through CRI-O. </p>
<p class="calibre2">This chapter is focused on giving a brief description of OpenShift as a <strong class="calibre4">Platform as a Service</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">PaaS</strong>) Solution. We will describe <strong class="calibre4">Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">IaaS</strong>) and PaaS clouds. As a part of the PaaS cloud descriptions, we will provide a basic explanation of OpenShift's business value. In this chapter, you will also learn about OpenShift's technical components and available OpenShift variants.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After reading this chapter, you will have learned about the following:</p>

<p class="calibre2">Today, any business expects automation to be a cornerstone of success. Traditional approaches are too slow when it comes to delivering innovation at the pace at which the business ecosystem changes. This is one of the main reasons why many businesses are moving towards automation and DevOps.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we take a look at evolving software delivery technologies, we can easily see that old-generation applications were installed first directly on bare metal, and then on virtual machines. And with time, these companies started using different IaaS cloud platforms. The reason is very obvious—the IaaS platform allows us to bring automation to the next level using cloud orchestration tools and exposed APIs. The way IaaS automation does this on an infrastructure level is that it simplifies virtual networking, storage, and virtual servers. To use IaaS platforms, we still need to install and configure applications and it is usually a time-consuming process. Imagine that there is a need to install and configure a PHP-based application from scratch each and every time you develop a new feature and test it. It takes a lot of time even with automation tools.</p>
<p class="calibre2">PaaS is the next generation of platforms to deliver applications in a quick and automated manner in production. With PaaS, the application delivering process looks very simple—there is no need to install and configure an application platform for web servers, databases, and so on. It is provided by the platform itself, OpenShift in our case. This means that you just need to upload your application code and database structures; the rest of it will be taken care of by PaaS:</p>
<p class="calibre2"><span class="calibre11">The following diagram shows the difference between hosting applications on bare-metal, IaaS, and PaaS platforms:</span></p>

<p class="calibre2">In previous chapters, we looked at how Kubernetes can simplify the management of Docker containers and take care of container deployment. Kubernetes brings additional value to container management across multiple nodes, which is very important in modern highly available and distributed infrastructure. Despite all the advantages Kubernetes has, it has drawbacks, and most of them are rectified by OpenShift.</p>
<p class="calibre2">OpenShift is a PaaS offering from Red Hat that natively integrates Docker and Kubernetes to create a powerful container cluster management and orchestration system. OpenShift encompasses the architecture, processes, platforms, and services needed to empower developers and operations teams. OpenShift increases reliability across all environments and meets all customer requirements while reducing infrastructure costs.</p>
<p class="calibre2">OpenShift leverages Kubernetes as a container management platform and adds several new important components and capabilities. Some of them are:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre20">Self-service Portal and Service Catalog</li>
<li class="calibre20">Build and application deployment automation</li>
<li class="calibre20">Built-in registry service</li>
<li class="calibre20">Extended application routing</li>
</ul>

<p class="calibre2">N-tier design is a standard application design like a three-tier web app with web, application, and database tiers. This design slowly evolved into the microservice architecture. The microservice architecture influences the industry and forces many companies to embrace this new trend and make it a new standard. The microservice architecture is much cheaper, scalable, and more secure compared to the monolithic and N-tier architectures. That is why containerized applications bring you to a whole new level:</p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter2"><img class="alignnone30" src="../images/00035.jpeg"/></div>
<div class="cdpaligncenter1">Application, Infrastructure, and Software development evolution</div>
<p class="calibre2">OpenShift pushes these boundaries even further, allowing both software developers and operation teams to utilize powerful microservice architecture and the simplicity of OpenShift GUI and the additional features it brings to the table. OpenShift is where you can really benefit from automation and DevOps. OpenShift has many built-in tools that allow the new microservice architecture to be backward-compatible with previous-generation software.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As we mentioned, the software development approach has also changed; initially, software developers followed a waterfall approach, polishing their apps to perfection and adding one feature after another, making sure it was bug-free. But it is neither time, nor money-efficient. That is why an agile approach came into the picture. Business owners needed shorted software development cycles. It was not perfect though, because of all the bugs and other shortcomings. The next evolutionary step was DevOps. OpenShift leverages modern DevOps processes and makes them simpler and more efficient.</p>

<p class="calibre2">OpenShift for production comes in several variants:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre20">OpenShift Origin</li>
<li class="calibre20">OpenShift Container Platform</li>
<li class="calibre20">OpenShift Online</li>
<li class="calibre20">OpenShift Dedicated</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">As with other products under the Red Hat umbrella, OpenShift has an upstream project called <strong class="calibre4">OpenShift Origin</strong>. The OpenShift Origin homepage is available at <a href="http://openshift.org" class="calibre8">http://openshift.org</a>. It has a number of installation methods, including the installation of a development environment on a local developer machine.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4">Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform</strong> is a production-ready build of OpenShift Origin with all Red Hat production advantages including official support, certification, and so on. OpenShift Container Platform integrates with Red Hat Enterprise Linux and is tested via Red Hat's QA process in order to offer a stable, supportable product for customers who want to have their own private or on-site cloud. An enterprise might get updates every six months, maintaining stabilization across minor updates. OpenShift Container Platform allows for building a private or public PaaS cloud on your infrastructure.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4">Red Hat OpenShift Online</strong> is a multi-tenant public cloud managed by Red Hat. OpenShift Online can be a good choice for companies that want to start working with OpenShift but don’t want to have their own on-premise infrastructure. This platform allows for hosting a small application for free.</p>
<p class="calibre2"><strong class="calibre4">Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated</strong> is a single-tenant container application platform hosted on <strong class="calibre4">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">AWS</strong>) or Google Cloud Platform and managed by Red Hat. It allows application development teams to quickly build, deploy, and scale traditional and cloud-native applications. OpenShift Dedicated is built on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Docker container technology, and Google Kubernetes for orchestration and management. It securely connects to your data center so you can implement a flexible, hybrid cloud IT strategy with minimal infrastructure and operating expenses. It can be a good choice for companies who don’t want to share the platform with other companies.</p>

<p class="calibre2">The OpenShift Container platform is both simple and complex when it comes to OpenShift components and overall architecture. It is complex in that it involves a lot of components interconnected with each other, but OpenShift is simple in the sense that all its components work independently of each other, and work seamlessly if something fails:</p>
<p class="cdpaligncenter"><img class="alignnone31" src="../images/00036.jpeg"/></p>
<div class="cdpaligncenter1">OpenShift components</div>
<p class="calibre2">OpenShift and Kubernetes have most architecture components in common, such as:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">OpenShift masters</li>
<li class="calibre10">OpenShift nodes</li>
<li class="calibre10">Etcd as a key-value store</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">Components that are unique to OpenShift are:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">Router as ingress traffic control</li>
<li class="calibre10">OpenShift Internal Registry</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">The following diagram describes the OpenShift container platform from an architectural point of view:</p>

<div class="cdpaligncenter1">OpenShift architecture</div>
<p class="calibre2">OpenShift is built on top of Docker and Kubernetes, sometimes referred to as Kubernetes++. In addition to the Docker and Kubernetes solution, OpenShift brings additional capabilities and features required to provide a stable and production-ready PaaS platform. These new capabilities and features are:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">Authentication</strong>: OpenShift has several built-in authentication methods to allow granular access to OpenShift projects:
<ul class="calibre29">
<li class="calibre20">Local authentication</li>
<li class="calibre20">LDAP authentication</li>
<li class="calibre20">Request header authentication</li>
<li class="calibre20">Keystone authentication</li>
<li class="calibre20">GitHub authentication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">Multi-tenancy</strong>: OpenShift's powerful functionalities allow granular multi-user and multi-project access control, a must-have feature for medium and large organizations that allows collaboration and access control for different groups.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">Internal Image Registry</strong>: OpenShift uses an internal registry to store images in OpenShift that are ready to be deployed on OpenShift nodes. It is also used for S2I builds.</li>
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">GUI and web console</strong>: OpenShift provides an easy-to-use web interface, powerful enough to create, build, deploy, update, and troubleshoot OpenShift projects and microservice applications running inside OpenShift.</li>

<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">Image builders</strong>: Process that is used to transform image parameters or source code into a runnable image.</li>
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">CI/CD Integration</strong>: OpenShift provides very flexible integration with Jenkins for Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery pipelines. It scales the pipeline execution through Jenkins provisioning in containers. This allows Jenkins to run as many jobs in parallel as required and scales solutions on demand out of the box.</li>
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">Additional Kubernetes resource extensions</strong>: There is a set of resources added to Kubernetes by OpenShift:
<ul class="calibre29">
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">Deployment Configurations (DC)</strong>: This is a set of pods created from the same container image.</li>
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">Build Configurations (BC)</strong>: Primarily used by S2I to build an image from source code in Git.</li>
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">Routes</strong>: DNS hostname service used by the OpenShift router as an ingress point for OpenShift applications,</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre20"><strong class="calibre1">REST API</strong>: In addition to the Kubernetes API, Openshift provides its own API interface to leverage all the features of automation and seamless integration with external platforms, other automation frameworks, and DevOps solutions.</li>
</ul>
