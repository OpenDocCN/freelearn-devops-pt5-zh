  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Developers are faced with ever-increasing pressure to build, modify, test, and
    deploy highly distributed applications in a high cadence. Operations engineers
    are looking for a uniform deployment strategy that encompasses most or all of
    their ever-growing portfolio of applications, and stakeholders want to keep their
    total cost of ownership low. Docker containers combined with a container orchestrator
    such as Kubernetes help them all to achieve these goals.

- en: Docker containers accelerate and simplify the building, shipping, and running
    of highly distributed applications. Containers turbo-charge CI/CD pipelines, and
    containerized applications allow a company to standardize on one common deployment
    platform, such as Kubernetes. Containerized applications are more secure and can
    be run on any platform that's able to run containers, on premises or in the cloud.

    explains how to start, stop, and remove containers. We will also see how to inspect
    containers to retrieve additional metadata from them. Furthermore, we''ll see
    how to run additional processes, how to attach to the main process in an already
    running container, and how to retrieve logging information from a container that
    is produced by the processes running inside it. Finally, the chapter introduces
    the inner workings of a container, including such things as Linux namespaces and
    groups.'

    modify, debug, and test their code while running in a container. With these techniques
    at hand, the developer will enjoy a frictionless development process for applications
    running in a container, similar to what they experience when developing applications
    that run natively.'

    having to install those tools on the host computer. We will also see how to use
    containers that host and run test scripts or code used to test and validate application
    services running in containers. Finally, this chapter guides us through the task
    of building a simple Docker-based CI/CD pipeline.'

    form of the bridge network. This chapter introduces the concept of software-defined
    networks and explains how they are used to secure containerized applications.
    It also discusses how container ports can be opened to the public and thus make
    containerized components accessible from the outside world. Finally, it introduces
    Traefik, a reverse proxy, to enable sophisticated HTTP application-level routing
    between containers.'
