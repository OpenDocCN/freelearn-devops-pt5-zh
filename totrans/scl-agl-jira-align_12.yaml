- en: The rise of agile frameworks in the 1990s and formalization of the Agile Manifesto
    in 2001 provided principles and practices that enabled iterative and incremental
    delivery by a single team or handful of teams. By the mid 2000s, the need to coordinate
    larger groups of agile teams to deliver more complex systems inspired the platform
    that became Jira Align.

    It establishes a common understanding, fosters cohesiveness, consistency, and
    credibility, and increases productivity.

- en: 'Four of the seven health checks are critical. They are: #4 – There should only
    be one project assigned to a Jira board; #5 – Mark custom fields as optional,
    not required; #6 – A single sprint should only be tied to one board; and #7 –
    Sprints on a Jira board should not have overlapping dates.'
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'There are two options for mapping projects/boards in Jira to teams in Jira
    Align: (1) One Jira project per program (team of teams) with one board per team
    and one active sprint per board – this requires a custom team field in Jira to
    drive each board; and (2) One Jira project per team with one board per team and
    one active sprint per board – this requires a separate project for Jira epics
    and results in a greater quantity of Jira projects than the first option.'
