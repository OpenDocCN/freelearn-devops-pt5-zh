<p>Xamarin is a platform that enables developers to create cross-platform applications on Android, iOS, Window, and other platforms, by using the same source code and the same <strong>integrated development environment</strong> (<strong>IDE</strong>).</p>

<p>Xamarin was started as an experiment to try and develop a version of .NET for Linux in early 2000, and was first known as an open source project called <strong>Mono</strong>.</p>
<p>Later, the same project was developed and supported by a new company called <strong>Xamarin</strong>, which was created by the very first developers of Mono, and was also known as <strong>MonoTouch</strong> and Mono for Android.</p>
<p>Development of Mono continued and it was later renamed Xamarin, which supported Android and iOS app development.</p>
<p>Xamarin has now been acquired by Microsoft and is developed and supported as one of the products offered by Microsoft with great integration with the existing IDE, Visual Studio, and it even has its own IDE, called Xamarin Studio, which is available for both Mac and Windows.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Why you should learn Xamarin</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Well, there are many scenarios where Xamarin can save the day, and in some cases literally months.</p>
<p>Let's say you have an idea for a mobile application that you want to develop. Of course, you want it to be developed soon and get it to market. But there are some small challenges and decisions that you should overcome or decide on before you dive into your development process.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at those challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Choose mobile platforms to target</strong>: This is a very important part in the planning phase of our application. The mobile platform market is divided into major players, such as Android, iOS, and Windows. To get the most out of our application, we will want it to be accessible and available to the majority of users out there.</li>
<li><strong>Learn a platform-specific coding language or have platform-specific developers in your team</strong>: Now, let's assume you have chosen to target all three of the major mobile platforms. We have a clear idea that we need to develop our application for three mobile platforms. Here, if you are developing it alone, then you need to learn all three different platform-specific languages. Android has its own official IDE, similarly Apple has its own IDE and coding language to build iOS applications, and Windows has its own as well.</li>
<li><strong>Spend time and resources in development for each platform</strong>: Three different platforms, three different languages, and three different IDEs. That is going to be very time-consuming and the learning curve is going to be a major issue. Or, you have three different developer teams for each platform; then, you will be spending a lot more resources on your development.</li>
<li><strong>Try and maintain a consistent behavior in all your applications for each platform</strong>: Now, let's assume you have decided to have multiple resources for the development of the application. Now, all different mobile platforms have a variety of different methods for user interaction, and different ways of designing user interfaces. Developing different platform applications with separate teams can sometimes make the user experience of the same application drastically different on these platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Maintain all the platform-specific codebase for your same application</strong>: Development challenges never end once initial development of the application is done. Whenever you add new features to your application, you will now have to apply the same changes and features to all three platform-specific codebases, repeat the same business logic, and develop the same feature in different ways on different IDEs.</li>
</ul>
<p>From the preceding scenarios, you can see that developing a mobile application is not that simple and straightforward nowadays, if we have to go through different coding languages and IDEs to do so.</p>
<p>It increases our time to deliver by a huge amount and is very expensive in terms of time, resources, and of course money.</p>
<p>In order to solve all the challenges, Xamarin comes to our rescue. Xamarin saves the developer from the need to learn different programming languages and different IDEs.</p>
<p>Not only that, we also get the benefit of writing our application code just once and building to different mobile platforms. And if you are a C# developer on the .NET framework using Visual Studio already, then you just hit the jackpot. Because guess what, that's all you need to start development using Xamarin as far as language and IDE goes.</p>

<p>With Xamarin, a developer's life gets much easier in many aspects of mobile application development:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language</strong>: The most time-consuming process is learning new languages every now and then; Xamarin frees developers from this issue. The only language you need to have experience in is C# to develop for Android, iOS, and Windows all at onceâ€”phew!</li>
<li><strong>IDE</strong>: With learning new languages comes another overhead: getting used to a new IDE every time. As soon as we get a new IDE for a different platform, our old shortcuts stop working. Files are not in the same place. Debugging is totally different. All these issues increase the development time. With Xamarin, you just have to use a single IDE that we already love, Visual Studio.</li>
<li><strong>Consistent UI design</strong>: Often, we wish our app looked the same on all mobile devices. We don't want users to buy a new phone and find a totally new app with different user interactions for the same purpose. In order to do this, Xamarin comes with <strong>Xamarin.Forms</strong> to develop consistent UI elements across all mobile platforms, giving our users a seamless experience.</li>
<li><strong>Code reusability</strong>: Xamarin allows us to share our business logic code across all platforms. For any business logic code, we have to write it only once.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mobile application development is a crucial part of any product development in today's market. Native mobile applications take user interaction with an application to a different level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Always one touch away</strong>: Native mobile applications, unlike web and desktop applications, are always on the user's mobile phone. Users can always opt not to visit a web application, and this brings the possibility of less interaction, but mobile applications are installed by users on their phones and whenever a user interacts with their phone, developers can take advantage of the user's activity and improve the interaction in many ways. The possibilities are unlimited.</li>
<li><strong>Knowing the user's behavior</strong>: Mobile applications can take advantage of the user's behavior on their phone. We can monitor a user's activities, such as walking, running, sleeping, and so on, to get personal user analytics and feedback.</li>
<li><strong>Always connected</strong>: Mobile data allows users to be connected to the internet on the go, and that increases the number of times users interact with the app. Mobile data provides a greater level of connectivity between the user and internet-connected apps.</li>
<li><strong>Taking advantage of cutting edge hardware sensors</strong>: Mobile apps have the ability to take advantage of sensors available to users on their mobile device, such as GPS, fingerprinting, gyroscope, and much more.</li>
<li><strong>Personal interaction</strong>: Mobile devices are very personal to individual users, unlike desktop and laptop devices. Nowadays, the world of personal assistants and speech synthesis technologies is making user interaction more personal and human, such as with voice inputs and actions.</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p>Like any other platform, mobile app development includes several key steps in the process of making a complete and stable mobile applications that users can use and love:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ideation</strong>: Every application starts with a small idea or a problem to solve. A powerful and impactful idea that can solve the user's problem results in a successful application. It is easier to think of a great idea now, more than ever before. We use our mobile devices and face many problems in day-to-day use, or sometimes wish for an app to be there. That, right there, is the genesis of an idea for a great application.</li>
<li><strong>Planning</strong>: Planning is a very important part of the process. An idea is only good if the execution of it is well planned:
<ul>
<li>How much time to market should it take?</li>
<li>Should the app be premium or free?</li>
<li>What mobile platform should we target?</li>
<li>What technologies and tools should be used?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Answers to all these questions must be known in the planning phase.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Designing</strong>: This is the part of application development when the idea begins to take shape and we can see how it might look once finished. Before starting coding, designing application wireframes and layouts is very important.</li>
<li><strong>Coding</strong>: By the time we reach the coding phase, we have a good idea about where want to go and what we want to see in our application. So, that enables the coding phase to focus only on the actual code development.</li>
<li><strong>Testing</strong>: Testing the application on various mobile devices is very important to the stability of application.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment and continuous feedback</strong>: After submitting the app to a store, it is very important to continuously monitor user feedback and reports, and act upon them.</li>
</ul>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As mentioned earlier in the chapter, Xamarin allows developers to create applications for multiple mobile operating systems by sharing the same code. The following are the platforms Xamarin supports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Xamarin.Android</strong>: Xamarin.Android allows us to build native Android apps using C#. It uses a <strong>just-in-time</strong> (<strong>JIT</strong>) compiler to optimize your app's performance. And it includes all the Android APIs that can be used in your Xamarin C# code. It goes from Android phones to tablets to even wearables.</li>
<li><strong>Xamarin.iOS</strong>: Similar to Xamarin.Android, Xamarin.iOS features all the existing APIs in, you guessed it, Apple's iOS SDK in C#. Also, Xamarin.iOS uses an <strong>ahead-of-time</strong> (<strong>AOT</strong>) compiler to compile your C# code to native ARM assembly code.</li>
<li><strong>Xamarin.Mac</strong>: Xamarin doesn't just stop at mobile platforms; you can also develop Mac applications using the same code base.</li>
<li><strong>Xamarin for Windows</strong>: Since C# is the default language to code for Windows phones and Windows desktop applications, you can even share the code between your mobile apps and <strong>Universal Windows Platform</strong> (<strong>UWP</strong>) apps.</li>
</ul>

<p>Visual Studio is the default IDE for writing C# code, although it's not the only option when it comes to writing apps with Xamarin.</p>
<p>There are other options, such as Xamarin Studio for Windows and Xamarin Studio for Mac if you have a Mac. Xamarin Studio for Windows, though, is no longer supported by Microsoft and they encourage developers to use Visual Studio instead. For developing on the Mac, you can use Xamarin Studio for Mac.</p>
<p>In this book, we'll be covering Xamarin development using Visual Studio on Windows, since it is the best IDE available for code development using C# and provides great IntelliSense support.</p>

<p>Visual Studio supports third-party libraries and native libraries using the NuGet package manager. It provides the functionality to add new add-ons and plugins from within Visual Studio.</p>
<p>Xamarin comes as an extension to Visual Studio. You can install Xamarin components while installing Visual Studio, as shown in the following topic.</p>

<p>To install Visual Studio and Xamarin on a Windows machine, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/"><span class="URLPACKT">https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/</span></a>.</li>
<li>When you open the preceding URL in a browser, you'll get a screen like this:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9a3beb20-ac49-4ea4-b666-e8ef6eece3c1.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>You can see there are several editions of Visual Studio available for developers.</li>
<li>You can choose the version best suited to your requirements. If you just want to learn Xamarin using Visual Studio, or if you are an individual developer looking for a free version, then Visual Studio Community Edition is best suited for you.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Free download</span> provided under <span class="packt_screen">Visual Studio Community 2017</span>.</li>
<li>You should get a Visual Studio installer file downloaded on your computer.</li>
<li>Open the installer file and you should see a screen like this:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d197fe9d-55bb-4e5f-a640-03031db35f47.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> button to begin the installation process.</li>
<li>It can take some time to load the installers available, and you might see the following screen:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/6709d457-0f47-4d9a-ac57-2de75de77b6d.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="10">
<li>The next screen let you to select <span class="packt_screen">Workloads</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/939baf8b-099e-4637-b45e-48546d3cf4aa.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Now, if you are new to Visual Studio 2017, you might find the installation process different from previous versions. Workloads are new in 2017 and they represent different packages used for different development purposes. For example, if you are planning to code only for .NET desktop applications, then you can choose only that workload and skip other workloads.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">This change in the Visual Studio 2017 installer is a great way to avoid the installation of components that we might not use in our development, and to just choose the required workload to install essential components only. This saves us a lot of time and space on our laptop.</p>
<ol start="11">
<li>In our development for Xamarin, we will require a workload that installs the Xamarin tools and languages required for mobile development. If you scroll a bit further down in this menu, you'll find a section called <span class="packt_screen">Mobile &amp; Gaming</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/41ca2ef9-122e-4279-a4d8-a286e84257b2.png"/></div>
<ol start="12">
<li>Under <span class="packt_screen">Mobile &amp; Gaming</span>, the very first option, and for our tutorial the only option required, will be Xamarin-<span class="packt_screen">Mobile development with .NET</span>.</li>
<li>Select this first option, and on the right-hand side panel you'll see all the packages included in this workload. The Visual Studio installer will also show you the size of the workload in the bottom-right corner. Once selected, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Install</span> button to begin the installation process.</li>
<li>This will start downloading all the listed packages and then installing them on your computer. The Xamarin package is more than 30 GB and it can take some time to download and install the packages, depending on your internet speed.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="15">
<li>Once the installer is done downloading and installing all the packages required, you'll see a screen like this:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2e7fc453-3586-45d6-a633-d1d13daf0caa.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="16">
<li>That's it. Congratulations on your successful installation of Visual Studio and Xamarin. Now, select <span class="packt_screen">Visual C#</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Development Settings</span> and your favorite color theme for Visual Studio IDE, and hit the <span class="packt_screen">Start Visual Studio</span> button.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="17">
<li>Once the installation is done, let's verify that Xamarin is installed with Visual Studio.</li>
<li>Click on the <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> menu and select <span class="packt_screen">Extensions and Updates</span>.</li>
<li>Under the <span class="packt_screen">Installed</span> section, scroll down to find <span class="packt_screen">Xamarin for Visual Studio</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Xamarin.Andoid SDK</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Xamarin.Apple SDK</span> installed:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="20">
<li>Now that we have verified the installation, we have some final steps before we start coding. We are going to focus on the Android application development process in this book to give you a better idea of how Xamarin works.</li>
<li>Let's update all the Android packages with the help of Android SDK Manager, which is already installed with Xamarin.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="22">
<li>Open <span class="packt_screen">Tools</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Android</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Android SDK Manager</span>:</li>

<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/7f640ed7-c04b-45db-9cb0-a22534ef79c0.png" style=""/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">Here, we can see the updates available for the basic packages installed.</p>
<ol start="24">
<li>Let's click on <span class="packt_screen">Install 11 packages</span>.</li>
<li>This will give you a new window where you will have to accept the licenses for the packages to be downloaded. Some of the licenses might need to be selected individually, depending on the package. Once you see all green ticks on the packages, click <span class="packt_screen">Install</span>. It will take some time to update all the packages available, depending on your internet speed:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/12acdf4e-a1ea-4ab1-a234-6e88cc92bb46.png"/></div>
<p>Once everything is updated, let's move on to setting up our <strong>Android Virtual Device</strong> (<strong>AVD</strong>) to test our application in a development environment.</p>

<li>We need to check VT-x is enabled in the BIOS for our machine before running the emulator. Our machine must have Intel VT-x enabled, and if we have Hyper-V installed on the machine, that needs to be uninstalled as well.</li>
<li>Otherwise, you will see a screen like this stating the issue while starting the emulator:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign" style="color: black;font-size: 1em"><img src="assets/2e088a3b-02c9-4294-8489-48cabc2c4f9b.png"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In the preceding screenshot, we can see <span class="packt_screen">VT feature disabled in BIOS/UEFI</span>.</p>
<ol start="13">
<li>To enable VT/VT-x, go to the BIOS and there you should see an option to enable Virtualization Technology (VT-x). We won't be getting into the process of how to do this, since it differs from machine to machine.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="14">
<li>Apart from enabling VT, we also need to check whether Hyper-V is installed on our machine. To do so, follow these steps:
<ol>
<li>Open <span class="packt_screen">Control Panel</span>.</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Programs</span>:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>

<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol start="3">
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">Turn Windows Features on or off</span>:</li>

</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol start="4">
<li>Scroll down to check whether you find <span class="packt_screen">Hyper-V</span> in the list of programs:</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/9fe3f8ae-888e-4db6-aea0-c1e444a7e06a.png"/></div>
<ol>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol start="5">
<li>Unselect <span class="packt_screen">Hyper-V</span> if it is currently selected. Click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span>.</li>
<li>This might restart your system.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/2e7c3785-14ef-43eb-bfed-8baab38ce4fb.png"/></div>
<ol start="14">
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ol start="7">
<li>This should remove Hyper-V, and finally we are good to go.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="15">
<li>Let's come back to Visual Studio to start our AVD. This time, the emulator starts successfully and looks like this:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign" style="color: black;font-size: 1em"><img src="assets/1c16411c-42f4-4039-adce-fc96039c7b66.png" style=""/></div>
<ol start="16">
<li>If your AVD doesn't look like the preceding screenshot, please go back and edit the AVD to change the skin to <span class="packt_screen">No skin</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Awesome! Now we have our running Android Virtual Device we can begin coding our new Android application with Xamarin.</p>

<p>In this chapter, we learned about the brief history of Xamarin and why it's a great tool for developers looking for cross-platform mobile app development.</p>
<p>We also learned how to install Visual Studio and Xamarin on a Windows machine, along with how to create an AVD for testing our app.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will learn about basic application fundamentals and create our first Android application using Xamarin.</p>
