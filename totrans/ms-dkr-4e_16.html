			<h1 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor923"/>Next Steps with Docker</h1>
			<p>You’ve made it to the last chapter of this book, and you’ve stuck with it until the end! In this chapter, we will look at the Moby Project and how you can contribute to Docker, as well as to the community. We will then finish this chapter with a quick overview of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.</p>
			<p>The following topics will be covered in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Moby Project</li>
				<li>Contributing to Docker</li>
				<li>The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor924"/>The Moby Project</h1>
			<p>One of the announcements <a id="_idIndexMarker1130"/>made at DockerCon 2017 was the Moby Project. When this project was announced, I had a few questions about what the project was from work colleagues, because on the face of it, Docker had appeared to have released another container system.</p>
			<p>I answered with the following:<a id="_idTextAnchor925"/><a id="_idTextAnchor926"/></p>
			<p class="author-quote">The Moby Project is the open source framework created by Docker (the company) that allows it, and anyone else who wishes to contribute to the project, to assemble container systems “without having to reinvent the wheel”.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">Think of the framework as a set of building blocks made up of dozens of components that allow you assemble your own custom container platform. The Moby project is used to create the open source community edition of Docker and the commercially supported Docker Enterprise edition.</p>
			<p>For anyone who asks for an example of a similar project that combines a bleeding-edge version, a stable open source release, and an enterprise supported version, I explain what Red Hat does with Red Hat Enterprise Linux:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">Think of it like the approach Red Hat have taken with Red Hat Enterprise Linux. You have Fedora, which is the bleeding-edge version development playground for Red Hat’s operating system developers to introduce new packages and features, and also to remove old, outdated components. </p>
			<p class="author-quote">Typically, Fedora is a year or two ahead of the features found in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which is the commercially supported long-term release based on the work done in the Fedora project; as well as this release, you also have the community support version in the form of CentOS.</p>
			<p>You may be thinking to yourself, <em class="italic">why has this only been mentioned right at the very end of this book?</em> The project isn’t really designed for end users. It is intended for use by software engineers, integrators, and enthusiasts looking to experiment with, invent, and build systems based on containers – which is not necessarily Docker.</p>
			<p>At the time of writing, due changes at Docker (the company) with the Docker Enterprise sale to Mirantis and Docker refocusing their attention back onto developers, there are talks of moving the Moby code back to Docker, so I will not go into any more detail about the Moby Project as it is likely to change by the time you read this; instead, I would recommend <a id="_idIndexMarker1131"/>bookmarking the following pages to keep up to date with this how the project develops:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The project’s main website, at <a href="https://mobyproject.org/">https://mobyproject.org/</a></li>
				<li>Moby Project GitHub pages, at <a href="https://github.com/moby/">https://github.com/moby/</a> </li>
				<li>The Moby Project Twitter account, a good source of news and links to how-tos, at <a href="https://twitter.com/moby/">https://twitter.com/moby/</a></li>
				<li>Discussion around moving Moby back to Docker: <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/40222">https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/40222</a> and <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2019/11/22/moby_docker_naming/">https://www.theregister.com/2019/11/22/moby_docker_naming/</a></li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor927"/>Contributing to Docker</h1>
			<p>So, you want to help<a id="_idIndexMarker1132"/> contribute to Docker? Do you have a great idea that you would like to see in Docker or one of its components? Let’s get you the information and tools that you need to do that. If you aren’t a programmer-type person, there are other ways you can help contribute as well. Docker has a massive audience, and another way you can <a id="_idIndexMarker1133"/>help contribute is to help with supporting other users with their services. </p>
			<p>Let’s learn how you can do that as well.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor928"/>Contributing to the code</h2>
			<p>One of the biggest ways you can <a id="_idIndexMarker1134"/>contribute to Docker is by helping with the Moby code, as this is the upstream project that Docker is based on.</p>
			<p>Since Moby is open source, you can download the code to your local machine and work on new features and present them as pull requests back to Moby. They will then get reviewed on a regular basis, and if they feel what you have contributed should be in the service, they will approve the pull request. This can be very humbling when it comes to knowing that something you have written has been accepted.</p>
			<p>You first need to know how you can get set up to contribute: this is pretty much everything for Docker (<a href="https://github.com/docker/">https://github.com/docker/</a>) and Moby Project (<a href="https://github.com/moby/">https://github.com/moby/</a>).</p>
			<p>But how do we go about getting set up to help contribute? The best place to start is by following the guide that can be found on the official Moby documentation at <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md</a>.</p>
			<p>As you may have already guessed, you do not need much to get a development environment up and running as a lot of development is done within containers. For example, other than having a GitHub account, Moby lists the following three pieces of software as the bare minimum:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Git: <a href="https://git-scm.com/">https://git-scm.com/</a></li>
				<li>Make: <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/make/">https://www.gnu.org/software/make/</a> </li>
				<li>Docker: If you made it this far, you shouldn’t need a link</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can find more details on how to prepare your own Docker development for Mac and Linux at <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/docs/contributing/software-required.md">https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/docs/contributing/software-required.md</a> and for Windows at <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/docs/contributing/software-req-win.md">https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/docs/contributing/software-req-win.md</a>.</p>
			<p>To be a successful open<a id="_idIndexMarker1135"/> source project, there have to be some community guidelines. I recommend reading through the excellent quick start guide that can be found at https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#moby-community-guidelines as well as the more detailed contribution workflow documentation at <a href="https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/docs/contributing/who-written-for.md">https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/docs/contributing/who-written-for.md</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor929"/>Offering Docker support</h2>
			<p>You can also contribute to <a id="_idIndexMarker1136"/>Docker by other means beyond contributing to the Docker code or feature sets. You can help by using the knowledge you have obtained to help others in their support channels. The community is very open, and someone is always willing to help. </p>
			<p>I find it of great help when I run into something and I am found scratching my head. It’s also nice to get help but to also contribute to others; this is a nice give and take. It also is a great place to harvest ideas for you to use. You can see what questions others are asking based on their setups and it could spur ideas that you may want to think about using in your environment.</p>
			<p>You can also follow the GitHub issues that are brought up regarding the services. These could be feature requests and how Docker may implement them, or they could be issues that have cropped up through the use of services. You can help test out the issues that others are experiencing to see whether you can replicate the issue or whether you find a possible solution to their issue.</p>
			<p>Docker has a very active<a id="_idIndexMarker1137"/> community that can be found at <a href="https://www.docker.com/docker-community">https://www.docker.com/docker-community</a>; here, you will not only be able to see the latest community news and events, but you will also be able to chat with Docker users and developers in their Slack channels. At the time of writing this book, there are over 80 channels covering all sorts of topics, such as Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, Alpine Linux, Swarm, Storage, and Network to name but a few, with hundreds of active users at any one time.</p>
			<p>Finally, there are also the <a id="_idIndexMarker1138"/>Docker forums, which can be found at <a href="https://forums.docker.com/">https://forums.docker.com/</a>. These are a good source if you want to search for topics/problems or keywords.</p>
			<p>The Docker Community is <a id="_idIndexMarker1139"/>governed by a code of conduct that covers both how their staff and community as a whole should act. It is open source and licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0, and states the following:</p>
			<p class="author-quote">We are dedicated to providing a harassment­-free experience for everyone, and we do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We ask you to be considerate of others and behave professionally and respectfully to all other participants. This code and related procedures also apply to unacceptable behavior occurring outside the scope of community activities, in all community venues— online and in-person— as well as in all one-on-one communications, and anywhere such behavior has the potential to adversely affect the safety and well-being of community members. Exhibitors, speakers, sponsors, staff and all other attendees at events organized by Docker, Inc (DockerCon, meetups, user groups) or held at Docker, Inc facilities are subject to these Community Guidelines and Code of Conduct.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">Diversity and inclusion make the Docker community strong. We encourage participation from the most varied and diverse backgrounds possible and want to be very clear about where we stand.</p>
			<p class="author-quote">Our goal is to maintain a safe, helpful, and friendly Docker community for everyone, regardless of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other protected categories under applicable law.</p>
			<p>The full code of conduct can be found at <a href="https://github.com/docker/code-of-conduct/">https://github.com/docker/code-of-conduct/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor930"/>Other contributions</h2>
			<p>There are other ways <a id="_idIndexMarker1140"/>to contribute to Docker as well. You can do things such as promoting the service and gathering interest at your institution. You can start this communication through your own organization’s means of communications, whether that be email distribution lists, group discussions, IT roundtables, or regularly scheduled meetings.</p>
			<p>You can also schedule meetups within your organization to get people talking. These meetups are designed to not only include your organization, but the city or town members that your organization is in, in order to get more widespread communication and promotion of the <a id="_idIndexMarker1141"/>services.</p>
			<p>You can search whether there are already meetups in your area by visiting <a href="https://www.docker.com/community/meetup-groups/">https://www.docker.com/community/meetup-groups/</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor931"/>The Cloud Native Computing Foundation</h1>
			<p>We discussed The Cloud Native<a id="_idIndexMarker1142"/> Computing Foundation briefly in <a href="B15659_11_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor294"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>,<em class="italic"> Docker and Kubernetes</em>. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, or CNCF for short, was founded to provide a vendor-neutral home for projects that allow you to manage your containers and microservices architectures.</p>
			<p>Its membership includes Docker, Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Red Hat, Oracle, VMWare, and Digital Ocean, to name a few. In June 2020, the Linux Foundation reported that CNCF had 452 members. These members not only contribute projects but also engineering time, code, and resources.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor932"/>Graduated projects</h2>
			<p>At the time of <a id="_idIndexMarker1143"/>writing this book, there are ten graduated projects, some of which we have discussed in previous chapters. The two which have already covered are also the most well-known out of the ten projects that are maintained by the foundation are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Kubernetes</strong> (<a href="https://kubernetes.io">https://kubernetes.io</a>): This <a id="_idIndexMarker1144"/>was the first project to be donated to the Foundation. As we have already mentioned, it was originally developed by Google and now counts more than 2,300 contributors across members of the foundation as well as the open source community.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Prometheus</strong> (<a href="https://prometheus.io">https://prometheus.io</a>): This project was donated to the foundation <a id="_idIndexMarker1145"/>by SoundCloud. As we saw in <a href="B15659_15_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor823"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Docker Workflows</em>, it is a real-time monitoring and alerting system that’s backed by a powerful time-series database engine.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is also the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Envoy</strong> (<a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/">https://www.envoyproxy.io/</a>): Originally created inside Lyft and used companies such as Apple, Netflix, and<a id="_idIndexMarker1146"/> Google, Envoy is a highly optimized service mesh that provides load balancing, tracing, and observability of the database and network activity across your environment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">CoreDNS</strong> (<a href="https://coredns.io/">https://coredns.io/</a>): This is a small, flexible, extendable, and highly optimized DNS server that’s <a id="_idIndexMarker1147"/>written in Go and designed from the ground up to run in an infrastructure that can be running thousands of containers.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Containerd</strong> (<a href="https://containerd.io/">https://containerd.io/</a>): We <a id="_idIndexMarker1148"/>briefly mentioned Containerd in <a href="B15659_01_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor046"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Docker Overview</em>, as being one of the open source projects that Docker has been working on, and <a id="_idIndexMarker1149"/>we also used it in <a href="B15659_12_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor394"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Discovering more Kubernetes options</em>. It is a standard container runtime that allows developers to embed a runtime that can manage both Docker- and also OCI-compliant images in their platforms or applications.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Fluentd</strong> (<a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">https://www.fluentd.org/</a>): This tool allows you to collect log data from a large <a id="_idIndexMarker1150"/>number of sources and then route the logging data to a number of log management, database, archiving, and alerting systems such as Elastic Search, AWS S3, MySQL, SQL Server, Hadoop, Zabbix, and Data<a id="_idTextAnchor933"/><a id="_idTextAnchor934"/>Dog, to name a few. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Jaeger</strong> (<a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/">https://www.jaegertracing.io/</a>): This is a fully distributed tracing system that was<a id="_idIndexMarker1151"/> originally developed by Uber to monitor its extensive microservices environment. Now in use by companies such as Red Hat, it features a modern UI and native support for OpenTracing and various backend storage engines. It has been designed to integrate with other CNCF projects such as Kubernetes an<a href="https://vitess.io/">d Prometheus.</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://vitess.io/"><strong class="bold">Vite</strong></a><strong class="bold">ss</strong> (<a href="https://vitess.io/">https://vitess.io/</a>): This <a id="_idIndexMarker1152"/>has been a core component of the MySQL database infrastructure of YouTube since 2011. It is a clustering system that horizontally scales MyS<a href="https://helm.sh/">QL via sharding.</a></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Helm</strong> (<a href="https://helm.sh/">https://helm.sh/</a>): Built<a id="_idIndexMarker1153"/> for Kubernetes, Helm is a package manager that allows users to package their <a id="_idIndexMarker1154"/>Kubernetes applications in an easily distributable format, and has quickly become a standard.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To graduate, a project must have done the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Adopted the CNCF code of conduct, which is similar to the one published by Docker. The full code of conduct can be found at <a href="https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md">https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md</a>.</li>
				<li>Obtained a <strong class="bold">Linux Foundation</strong> (<strong class="bold">LF</strong>) <strong class="bold">Core Infrastructure Initiative</strong> (<strong class="bold">CII</strong>) Best Practices badge, which demonstrates that the project is being developed using an established set of best practices – the full criteria of which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/criteria.md">https://github.com/coreinfrastructure/best-practices-badge/blob/master/doc/criteria.md</a>.</li>
				<li>Acquired at least two organizations with committers to the project.</li>
				<li>Defined the committer process and project governance publicly via <code>GOVERNANCE.md</code> and <code>OWNERS.md</code> files in the project’s repo.</li>
				<li>Publicly listed the projects adopters in an <code>ADOPTERS.md</code> file or by logos on the project’s website.</li>
				<li>Received a super majority vote from the <strong class="bold">Technical Oversight Committee</strong> (<strong class="bold">TOC</strong>). You can find out more about the committee at <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc">https://github.com/cncf/toc</a>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>There is also another project status, which is where the majority of projects currently are.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-307"><a id="_idTextAnchor935"/>Incubating projects</h2>
			<p>Projects at the incubating<a id="_idIndexMarker1155"/> stage should eventually have a graduated status. The following projects have all done the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Demonstrated that the project is in use by a minimum of three independent end users (not the originator of the project)</li>
				<li>Gained a healthy number of contributors, both internally and externally</li>
				<li>Demonstrated growth and a good level of maturity</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The TOC is heavily involved in working with projects to ensure that the levels of activity are enough to meet the<a id="_idIndexMarker1156"/> preceding criteria since the metrics can vary from project to project.</p>
			<p>The current list of projects is as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">OpenTracing</strong> (<a href="https://opentracing.io/">https://opentracing.io/</a>): One of two tracing projects that now come under the CNCF <a id="_idIndexMarker1157"/>umbrella, the other being Jaeger. Rather than being an application, you download and use it as a set of libraries and APIs that let you build behavioral tracking and monitoring into your microservices-based applications.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">gRPC</strong> (<a href="https://grpc.io">https://grpc.io</a>): Like Kubernetes, gRPC was donated to the CNCF by Google. It is an open<a id="_idIndexMarker1158"/> source, extendable, and performance-optimized RPC framework, and is already in production at companies such as Netflix, Cisco, and Juniper Networks.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">CNI</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/containernetworking">https://github.com/containernetworking</a>): <strong class="bold">CNI</strong>, which is short for <strong class="bold">Container Networking Interface</strong>, is again not something you download and use. Instead, it is a <a id="_idIndexMarker1159"/>standard for network interfaces that’s designed to be embedded into container runtimes, such as Kubernetes and Mesos. Having a common interface and set of APIs allows more consistent support of advanced network functionality in these runtimes via third-party plugins and extensions.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Notary</strong> (<a href="https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary">https://github.com/theupdateframework/notary</a>): This project was originally written by <a id="_idIndexMarker1160"/>Docker and is an implementation of TUF, which we will cover next. It has been designed to allow developers to sign their container images by giving them a cryptographic tool that provides a mechanism to verify the provenance of their container images and content.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">TUF</strong> (<a href="https://theupdateframework.github.io">https://theupdateframework.github.io</a> ): <strong class="bold">The Update Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">TUF</strong>) is a standard that <a id="_idIndexMarker1161"/>allows software products, via the use of cryptographic keys, to protect themselves during installation and updates. It was developed by the NYU School of Engineering.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">NATS</strong> (https://nats.io): Here, we <a id="_idIndexMarker1162"/>have a messaging system that has been designed for environments running microservices or architectures supporting IoT devices.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Linkerd</strong> (<a href="https://linkerd.io">https://linkerd.io</a>): Built<a id="_idIndexMarker1163"/> by Twitter, Linkerd is a service mesh that has been designed to scale and cope with tens of thousands of secure requests per second.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Rook</strong> (<a href="https://rook.io">https://rook.io</a>): This focuses on providing an orchestration layer for managing Ceph, Red Hat’s<a id="_idIndexMarker1164"/> distributed storage system, among others on Kubernetes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Harbor</strong> (<a href="https://goharbor.io/">https://goharbor.io/</a>): This is <a id="_idIndexMarker1165"/>an open source image registry that focuses on security and access with inbuilt imaging scanning, RBAC controls, and image signing. It was originally developed by VMWare.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">etcd</strong> (<a href="https://etcd.io/">https://etcd.io/</a>): This is a<a id="_idIndexMarker1166"/> simple distributed key/value store with a REST API designed to be low latency, and it uses<a id="_idIndexMarker1167"/> the raft co<a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">nsensus algorithm.</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/"><strong class="bold">Open Policy A</strong></a><strong class="bold">gent</strong> (<a href="https://www.openpolicyagent.org/">https://www.openpolicyagent.org/</a>): This is a unified toolset and<a id="_idIndexMarker1168"/> framework for policy across your cloud-native stack.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">cri-o</strong> (<a href="https://cri-o.io/">https://cri-o.io/</a>): This is a lightweight container runtime built for Kubernetes; it allows you to<a id="_idIndexMarker1169"/> run any OCI-compliant container.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cloudevents</strong> (<a href="https://cloudevents.io/">https://cloudevents.io/</a>): This is a specification for describing event data in a <a id="_idIndexMarker1170"/>common way. There are also SDKs for Go, JavaScript, Java, C#, Ruby, an<a id="_idTextAnchor936"/><a id="_idTextAnchor937"/>d Python so you can easily introduce the specification in your own projects.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Falco</strong> (<a href="https://falco.org/">https://falco.org/</a>): Falco provides a cloud-native runtime security engine that <a id="_idIndexMarker1171"/>parses Linux system calls from the kernel as they are executed.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dragonfly</strong> (<a href="https://d7y.io/en-us/">https://d7y.io/en-us/</a>): This is <a id="_idIndexMarker1172"/>an open source<a id="_idIndexMarker1173"/> P2P-based image and file distribution system.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We have used a few of these projects in various chapters of this book, and I am sure that other projects will be of interest to you as you look to solve problems such as routing to your containers and monitoring your application within your environment.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-308"><a id="_idTextAnchor938"/>The CNCF landscape</h2>
			<p>CNCF provides<a id="_idIndexMarker1174"/> an interactive map of all of the projects managed by them and their members, and can be found at <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">https://landscape.cncf.io/</a>. One of the key <a id="_idIndexMarker1175"/>takeaways is as follows:</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">You are viewing 1,403 cards with a total of 2,263,137 stars, a market cap of $16.98T, and funding of $66.05B</strong>.</p>
			<p>While I am sure you will agree that these are some very impressive figures, what is the point of this? Thanks to the work of the CNCF, we have projects, such as Kubernetes, that are providing a standardized set of tools, APIs, and approaches for working across multiple cloud infrastructure providers and also on-premise and bare metal services—providing the building blocks for you to create and deploy your own highly available, scalable, and performant container and microservice applications.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-309"><a id="_idTextAnchor939"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>I hope that this chapter has given you an idea about the next steps you can take in your container journey. One of the things I have found is that while it is easy to simply use these services, you get a lot more out of it by becoming a part of the large, friendly, and welcoming communities of developers and other users, who are just like you, and have sprung up around the various software and projects.</p>
			<p>This sense of community and collaboration has been further strengthened by the formation of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. This has brought together large enterprises who, until just a few years ago, wouldn’t have thought about collaborating in public with other enterprises who have been seen as their competitors on large-scale projects.</p>
