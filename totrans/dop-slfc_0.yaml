    of an enterprise in various areas, such as sales, marketing, and finance. Deploying
    Salesforce applications is a tricky business, and it can get quite taxing for
    administrators and consultants. This book will help you implement DevOps for Salesforce
    and explore its features. You will learn DevOps principles and techniques for
    enterprise operations in Salesforce and see how to implement continuous integration
    and continuous delivery using tools such as Jenkins and Ant scripts. You will
    also learn how to use the Force.com Migration Tool and Git to achieve versioning
    in Salesforce.
