- en: '[Chapter 1](part0019.html#I3QM0-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd), *Get Started
    with Creating Your Project*, is about getting started with creating your project.
    We''ll talk about how projects help you to keep your work organized and learn
    why JIRA is so popular and where it came from. We''ll also talk about creating
    an account with Atlassian so that you can get started using JIRA on the cloud.
    We''ll look into the projects themselves and how we use a project to organize
    all work items. We''ll then look into the screens, workflows, and permissions,
    which will allow us to customize our project, and the views, notifications, and
    permissions that go along with it.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](part0032.html#UGI00-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd), *Managing
    Work Items*, is all about the difference between epics, stories, bugs, and tasks,
    learning what the different types of issues are, and why we would use each one.
    We''ll talk about the attributes for those issues, learning what these different
    work item attributes are and how to customize them to fit your needs. We''ll also
    cover managing items in the work, in the backlog, so that all that stuff will
    be a backlog in JIRA, and we''ll talk about how to define, prioritize, and refine
    it. Then, we''ll talk about creating and configuring a board, and how you would
    do that. If you''re familiar with Scrum, you know what I mean by a Scrum board.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](part0039.html#1565U0-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd), *Running
    Your Project in JIRA*, is about running the project. We''ll create and start a
    Sprint. We''ll use our backlog to refine the work and then plan and begin the
    Sprint iteration. We''ll also look at the daily Scrum and how we use JIRA to keep
    the team aligned, and how to know whether we''re on track to meet our commitments.
    We''ll focus on the differences between smaller stories or tasks, and when do
    we use each one, and then we''ll talk about how to close a Sprint, and learn how
    to end that Sprint, and what to do with any work that hasn''t been completed.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](part0045.html#1AT9A0-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd), *Working
    with Reports*, explores all about versions and releases—what they are and how
    they''re different from each other. We''ll talk about burndowns, about Sprint
    reports, and how to read those to determine whether or not your team is doing
    well. We''ll also take a look at velocity charts, which we can use to determine
    the performance of the team. We will take a look at releasing epic burndowns,
    as well as versions and epic reports, which give you the ability to do forecasting,
    which is very powerful.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](part0059.html#1O8H60-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd), *Searching
    and Filtering on Issues*, is about JQL, what it is, how to write queries in JIRA
    using simple and advanced editors, and how to export your results. We''ll talk
    about saving and managing filters, and then executing bulk changes, and then how
    to use those filters to create new boards. This will give you new views of your
    work items in JIRA.'

- en: '[Chapter 6](part0066.html#1UU540-ef3008314c7341ae8da50eeac4cdaacd), *Dashboards
    and Widgets*, teaches us what a dashboard is, how you would use it, the different
    things you can put on a dashboard, the different layouts you can have for it,
    and then how to share it so that you can ensure that you''re able to broadcast
    the results of the team and how things are going. Hence, there aren''t a lot of
    prerequisites for this course, just a couple of things that I thought would be
    helpful—one is to have a basic knowledge of Scrum. We''ll reference Scrum a fair
    amount as we''re running an Agile project in JIRA, so that would be helpful for
    you to know. Still, it would be nice to have at least one team of people that
    are looking to work together, because that''s what JIRA is really great for, having
    a team of people work together, not necessarily just one person working on something.
    Although it can work for that, having a team that you can apply these concepts
    to once you''ve learned them will be really helpful.'
