<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we're going to talk about dashboards and widgets in JIRA. We're going to cover creating and managing dashboards, adding gadgets to our dashboards, and sharing our dashboards.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dashboards are really about broadcasting how things are going and being able to share that at a high level, and being visible and transparent with the results of the project.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating and managing a dashboard</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to talk about creating and managing a dashboard. We're going to learn what a dashboard is and how to create a dashboard.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's go ahead and hop on over to JIRA, and take a look at some dashboards.</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">In our projects, we had First Project and Second Project, and on the left-hand side, we can see Dashboards. JIRA will come with a System dashboard by default, so we can take a look at that in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00133.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>System dashboard</p>
<p class="calibre2">What we can see is an Activity Stream and other tabs, but what we want to do is create our own dashboard, so in the upper right-hand corner go to Create dashboard. We'll get some options, where we can name the dashboard <kbd class="calibre12">My Great Dashboard</kbd>, and give it a description of <kbd class="calibre12">All the good things</kbd>. We can Start from a Blank dashboard, System dashboard, or an existing one. We have a favorites list, and we can mark our dashboard as a favorite in case we have many. We can also choose our sharing options, where we've got project, any login user, or public. However, for now, we'll just leave it in its default state:</p>
<div><img src="img/00134.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">As we can see in the following screenshot, we've created our dashboard, where we can add a new gadget:</p>
<div><img src="img/00135.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">But more importantly at this moment in time, let's take a look at the layout:</p>
<div><img src="img/00136.jpeg" class="calibre89"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can see in the preceding screenshot that we can have one page, which is like one giant chunk where we can have multiple columns: we can have a small column and a big one, we can have the opposite of that, or we can have three columns; it's up to us what we choose. We'll leave it as the default settings right now, but we think it's important that we know that we have these options so that we can share a dashboard that is configured in a way that's visually pleasing once we start to put these gadgets together. That's how we create a dashboard.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Adding gadgets to our dashboard</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to talk about adding gadgets to our dashboard. We'll learn about how to add the filter results gadget to our dashboard, the pie chart gadget, and also the two-dimensional filter statistics. In reality, there's lots and lots of gadgets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's go ahead and add some gadgets. Go back to JIRA; remember, we were dealing with my great dashboard, which we created in the last section.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There's something we should know about gadgets. First of all, there are lots of them, so JIRA comes pre-loaded with quite a few. Also, when we took a look at the Atlassian marketplace, there were about 95 different gadgets that were available for us to load into our dashboard as well. There's even a gadget there to help us when we create our own gadgets, so in addition to that, we can do things like reporting. This means that we can really extend a dashboard quite a bit to visualize all kinds of different things.</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">Let's take a look at the gadgets we want to add. On our dashboard, we've got the two column layout, so let's click add a new gadget. This will take us to the following screen:</p>
<div><img src="img/00137.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Adding gadgets</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">The first one we're going to talk about today is used to filter results. We can see there's lots of different things available on the left-hand side; we've got Wallboard, JIRA, Charts, gadgets, and more. We're going to be looking for the filter results, so we'll search by <kbd class="calibre12">filter</kbd>. Now, add the gadget:</p>
<div><img src="img/00138.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Adding gadgets</p>
<p class="calibre2">We're also going to look for the pie chart, so we type in <kbd class="calibre12">pie</kbd>, and add that gadget from the result as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/00139.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">And then we're also going to get the two-dimensional filter statistics gadget, so let's take a look at that one:</p>
<div><img src="img/00140.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Adding the two-dimensional filter statistics gadget</p>
<p class="calibre2">Those are the three we're going to look at, and as we can see, we can keep adding them to our dashboard. The first thing we're going to do is give it a filter, which is going to be the two-dimensional filter, and we want to say, <em class="calibre8">we want to see the contents of the first and second projects</em>. Remember that filter from the previous section? This will show us the contents of all of the first and second projects. On our XAxis, we want to have the Status as horizontal access, so this would be the status of all the work items, and on the YAxis, we want to have the Assignee. We can change the sort, the sort direction, the number of results, and more. We can even set it to update every 15 minutes if we want to. We'll leave these as default for now and click Save:</p>
<div><img src="img/00141.jpeg" class="calibre90"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">What we're going to see is the contents of the first and second projects. Here, we can see the Assignee, or unassigned items, how many items are in progress, how many are to do, how many are done, and we get our totals. The other interesting thing is that we can actually click the link and this will take us to search for those issues, and it will show us the 18 items that are our items that are done. If we have a large team, this is a really good way at looking at the items for each person and the state that they're in. This is why we can use this one quite a bit:</p>
<div><img src="img/00142.jpeg" class="calibre91"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Let's take a look at the pie chart. We can do the same thing here: we can take a look at some of the filters and the projects that we have:</p>
<div><img src="img/00143.jpeg" class="calibre92"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Let's take a look at what we have. We will look at the First Project and keep the Statistic Type as Status. We'll hit Save, and we can see that we now have a pie chart:</p>
<div><img src="img/00144.jpeg" class="calibre93"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">This chart shows us the work that's done, and the work that's still to be done. If we had a large team, for example, we could look at how many people have, how many work items, or what the status is of the items that they have, or any number of things, but we will be able to visualize this in a pie chart.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Next, we're going to take a look at our favorite filter. Let's pick a filter. We can pick the open Sprint work items option that we have. Again, we're going to use the First Project items that are open. Here, we can have up to 10 results; there are the columns to display, and we can configure them or delete them. Let's go ahead and save it:</p>
<div><img src="img/00145.jpeg" class="calibre94"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Let's go ahead and go back into our edit. Here, we can take a look at the Second Project board. We can select a filter, and then we can display the contents of that filter, shown as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/00146.jpeg" class="calibre95"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can see the contents because we selected 10 items and we're only seeing 10 of 12, but we could set that to as many as we wanted as well as configure which columns show up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We could use these three examples of gadgets on our dashboards, but there are lots of different ones that we can choose from. In the next section, we're going to be talking about sharing our dashboard.</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Sharing the dashboard</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to learn how to share our dashboard. Remember, the dashboard itself and the whole concept behind it is about broadcasting results and making the results of the effort visible and transparent, so that's really what we're trying to do: make sure that everyone has access to them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's hop on over to JIRA and take a look at the sharing settings for the dashboard. In the previous section, we created a migrated dashboard, and we gave it the contents that we can see in the following screenshot. We want to share this out so that everyone can see it. Go to the ellipsis in the upper right-hand corner, click it, and say Share dashboard:</p>
<div><img src="img/00147.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We also have lots of other options as well, but here, we're going to look at share. We can see that we've got the settings that we had when we originally set it up:</p>
<div><img src="img/00148.jpeg" class="calibre96"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can choose who should be able to see the dashboard, and we can even make it Public. We can see that this page states, sharing with the public will make this visible to everyone including users who are not logged in, but if we want our customers or someone to be able to see this, this is a nice option, and we can also click Update and share with them that way. Otherwise, we could choose anyone on the project, and then select which project, and more. This is basically how we would share our dashboard.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we talked about how to create a dashboard, how to add gadgets to our dashboard using the filters that we created in the previous sections, and how to share our dashboard with others and make those results transparent and visible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This brings us to the end of our JIRA time together.</p>
