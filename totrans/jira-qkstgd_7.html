                    <h1 class="header-title">Reports and Dashboards</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we will look at the reporting capabilities of Jira. Once you start working on the project, you will also want to track the progress of your work and analyzing the information that you have in your instance is very important. It could be as simple as knowing how many issues are complete in order to create a graphical report. </p>
<p>Each project in Jira has its own set of reports that you can monitor from time to time. Depending upon the type of application you are using, the reports might vary slightly. We will also look at the dashboard, which is a great way to create our own custom reports.</p>
<p>Topics covered in this chapter include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Jira Core reports</li>
<li>Jira Software reports</li>
<li>Jira Service Desk</li>
<li>Creating and sharing dashboards</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Jira Core reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this book, we have looked at all three types of application in Jira. We began with Jira Core, which can be used by any business team in the company to track their day-to-day activities.</p>
<p>Let's first look at the in-built reports within a Jira Core-type project. To find these reports, go to the Reports section in your project sidebar and you will notice that here, the reports are grouped into three categories: Issue analysis, Forecast &amp; management, and Other, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/13dcbeb7-214d-46d2-a8dd-fa2b3d63793f.png" style="width:27.42em;height:51.25em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>Most of these reports are easy to configure and self-explanatory, but let's look at a number of key reports.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Average Age Report</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Average Age Report that follows shows the average age of unresolved issues for a project or filter. This helps you see whether your backlog is being kept up-to-date. Basically, it means the average number of days for which issues are in an unresolved state on a given date as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/c8d77d72-3b9b-4921-ae7c-20d1df893853.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<p>In this report, when you see that the bar is increasing over a period of time, this means that issues are not being resolved on time.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Pie Chart Report</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is one of the most useful reports, and shows the breakdown of issues based on various fields in Jira. For example, the following chart shows how issues are broken down based on their workflow status:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/9d1fbd01-7a5a-4599-8583-9b9d7002ff92.png" style="width:35.33em;height:26.50em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p>The preceding chart is telling us that there are lots of tasks still in the To Do state and action must be taken to improve this situation. Similar reports can be based on other Jira as well that are used in the project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Jira Software reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you are working on an agile-based project, the reports that we saw earlier in the Jira Core section are also available here, but since Jira Software projects are different, you will also find a number of new reports here.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in the following diagram, you will find these reports under the Agile category within your Reports section:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/5196ef71-8ec2-4a58-8ced-e08f6ea3646e.png" style="width:36.50em;height:51.83em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 4</p>
<p>Let's now look at some important Agile-based reports.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Burndown chart</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When we plan our sprint in a Jira Software scrum-based project, we have the option to estimate our work using either story points or the number of hours. The following report shows the progress of the issues in a specific sprint based on the total estimated effort versus the actual effort:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/3af673e3-8332-4d1c-ad33-8a5218145638.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>If you look at the preceding chart, you will notice that in the beginning, the total story points planned were 11 and, based on the sprint duration, ideally, the total story points should be burned by the end of the sprint. This is represented by the baseline going down. As the work begins, another line representing the actual completion of the work will start that follows the original baseline. In an ideal scenario, the actual line should follow the baseline and, if the line goes up, then this means that more work is added in between the sprint, which is not good practice.</p>
<p>If the gap between the actual line and the baseline is too great, this means that it is unlikely that the team will complete its work on time.</p>
<p>A burndown chart is one of the most important reports in Agile-based projects that follow SCRUM.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Velocity chart</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Another important report that we will discuss is the velocity chart, which actually talks about the capacity of the team. Let's first look at the report, illustrated as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/15a237df-c356-4e20-8f54-22d0ef34dcb7.png" style="width:45.58em;height:35.75em;"/></div>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>When the sprint is planned, an estimation is done regarding the work that can probably be finished by the end of the sprint. At the start of a new project, this is a little difficult to estimate. Also, as the project progresses, team members might change or become unavailable, so it is very important to know the current capacity of the team.</p>
<p>The preceding chart tells us that in Sample Sprint 1, the team's commitment was 18, but 16 completed, while in Sample Sprint 2, the team's commitment was 11, and 11 completed, and finally, in Sample Sprint 3, the commitment was also delivered and completed.</p>
<p>Hence, the average capacity of the team is 16+11+14 divided by 3, in other words, 13.6, or roughly 14. Hence, based on past performance, we can allocate work to this team worth 14 story points.</p>
<p>This information is crucial for the manager because, if this number is too low or dropping, then appropriate action can be taken on time to improve it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Jira Service Desk</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's now look at some important Jira Service Desk reports that are unique to Service Desk only.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">SLA success rate</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>One of the unique features of Jira Service Desk is the concept of <strong>service-level agreements</strong> (<strong>SLAs</strong>) that you can configure for your project. Let's look at the following report concerning two SLAs:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/52237d47-f667-47f0-a768-0d543536dad6.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 7</p>
<p>This report provides the success rate percentage for the two SLAs that we have in the project—Time to first response and Time to resolution. There is a trend line as well that shows this information over time.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Satisfaction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In Jira Service Desk, there is an in-built feature that will ask the customers to provide their feedback. This is extremely important for the team, as this will tell them whether their service is good or bad. Let's look at the report first:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/c4ada832-8799-46ac-9915-00889d997d44.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 8</p>
<p>This report is telling us an Average rating on a scale of one to five stars and is quite detailed. You can see the customer Comment, the issue Key, and also the Agent who was involved in the resolution of the ticket.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating and sharing dashboards</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The reports we discussed earlier in this chapter are project specific and available when you are within a project. However, when you log in to your Jira instance, the first thing you see is a system dashboard, which is a default dashboard containing a set of small reports also known as gadgets. We can always create our own custom dashboard showing us information from one or multiple projects.</p>
<p>One advantage of the dashboard is that you don't need to go to individual projects and configure various reports one by one. Using the dashboard, you can get a bird's-eye view of what is happening in your project or team in one go. Let's create our own dashboard.</p>
<p>On the System dashboard, click on the three dots in the top-right corner and select Create dashboard, demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/cadd296e-314d-488a-8119-5d1522b127e6.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 9</p>
<p>Enter the Name and Description, select with whom you want to share it, and then click on the Create button, demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/2f7cfa0a-c6fc-4cac-9086-865f8a083b38.png" style="width:41.00em;height:44.17em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 10</p>
<p>You will then have an empty dashboard with the option to add various gadgets. Let's add the following gadgets to our dashboard:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average Age Chart</li>
<li>Sprint Burndown Gadget</li>
<li>Pie Chart: Sample Scrum Project</li>
<li>Agile Wallboard Gadget</li>
</ul>
<p>Yes, you have guessed correctly. These are similar reports to the ones that we discussed earlier, but this time, we want to have them handy on our dashboard. The gadgets will let you choose the project for which you want to create a report. Once you do that, your dashboard will be ready.</p>
<p>One great thing about the dashboard is that, apart from creating a collection of reports in a single place, you can share it with other team members, display it on a big screen in your office, and, most importantly, you can create multiple dashboards showing different information from a variety of projects. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we learned how to analyze the information that we already have in our Jira instance by first looking at various reports that come out-of-the-box, and later, we configured our own custom dashboard to have all those reports available to hand in one place.</p>
<p>In the next and final chapter, we will discuss best practices that you should always keep in mind when using Jira, and also when you are customizing the tool because, although Jira allows you to configure many things, it is also very important that you are aware of the consequences if these customizations are not done right. Observing best practices will ensure the longevity and top-notch performance of your Jira instance.</p>
