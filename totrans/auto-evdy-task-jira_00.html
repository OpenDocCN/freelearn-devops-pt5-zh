			<p>Jira started life as a tool for developers to track bugs in their software and, over the years, has evolved into a powerful project management platform, allowing organizations to plan, manage, and track work across multiple teams and across software, service management, and business projects.</p>
			<p>Over time, this has enabled teams to keep on top of their projects; however, it comes at a price of administrative overhead, with users having to constantly perform simple and repetitive tasks in order to ensure that Jira issues stay relevant to the work being performed.</p>
			<p>In late 2019, Atlassian acquired Automation for Jira, an app that allows users to automate tasks in Jira without needing to write any code. This has since been incorporated into Jira Cloud as a native feature, while still being offered as an optional add-on for users of server-based Jira products.</p>
			<p>This book is a hands-on guide for power users and Jira administrators to automate daily, repetitive, and tedious tasks using a no-code approach with the Jira family, including Jira Software, Jira Service Management, and Jira Core.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for Jira administrators and project managers who want to learn about the automation capabilities provided in Jira. Familiarity with Jira and a working knowledge of Jira administration concepts, including workflows and project configurations, is required.</p>

			<p><a href="B16551_07_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor117"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Automating Jira Software Projects</em>, explores a number of automations targeted at Jira Software projects in particular. You will be taken through some practical examples of automating typically repetitive tasks that developers encounter in their everyday work, such as keeping versions in sync between multiple projects, and ensuring that the correct sub-tasks are created for tasks and stories.</p>
			<p><a href="B16551_08_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor127"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Integrating with DevOps tools</em>, explains how to use automation to integrate with tools such as GitHub and Bitbucket. We will discover how to hook into events within these tools to automatically transition related issues on your Scrum board and notify the relevant parties of the updates.

We will explore techniques for debugging rules and solving common issues. We will also look at service limits and how you can monitor and maintain them, and finally, we'll examine automation performance insights and how you can use them to fine-tune your rules.</p>
			<p><a href="B16551_11_Final_ASB_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor169"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Beyond Automation; an Introduction to Scripting</em>, takes an introductory look at one of the most popular scripting add-ons for Jira and compares it with automation rules using a prior example so we can examine the differences between no-code automation rules and scripting in both Jira Cloud and Jira Server.</p>
