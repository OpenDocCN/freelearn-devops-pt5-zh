<h1 id="_idParaDest-52"><a id="_idTextAnchor052"/>Setting Up Confluence</h1>
<p>Getting started with Confluence is easy. But things can get derailed very quickly.</p>
<p>The amount and variety of information we collect on Confluence will increase daily, so keeping it organized is essential. To set up a system that people will enjoy using, it is necessary to sit down and plan. While making this plan, it is helpful to benefit from a well-known concept: <strong class="bold">information architecture</strong>.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will first learn fundamental concepts such as information architecture to help you set up the Confluence environment from scratch. The main goal of this chapter is to make an excellent start to your Confluence journey.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we’ll cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing information architecture</li>
<li>Planning your Confluence site</li>
<li>Installing and configuring Confluence</li>
<li>Managing users</li>
<li>Setting up spaces – team, project, company, and personal</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-53"><a id="_idTextAnchor053"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>You will need to have the following software requirements to complete this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date web browser</li>
<li>An active subscription to Confluence Cloud Premium</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-54"><a id="_idTextAnchor054"/>Introducing information architecture</h1>
<p>Information architecture is a highly complex concept, and it could easily fill up an entire book on its own. Our aim in this section is to raise awareness about the information architecture concept and to make you think about some basic questions on this subject. If we achieve this goal, we can proceed much more consciously in the following chapters of the book.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-55"><a id="_idTextAnchor055"/>Defining the requirements of your knowledge management system</h2>
<p>To predetermine <a id="_idIndexMarker105"/>the system’s features, we want to install and return to them frequently, as this will help us a<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> lot in keeping our focus. The most important requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should be able to record and view information easily</li>
<li>We should be able to find the information we are looking for easily</li>
<li>We should be able to quickly reach other concepts related to an idea</li>
<li>We should be able to view the outline of the information architecture easily</li>
<li>The system should be easy to use for people from different cultures</li>
<li>The system should be flexible, allowing us to make changes</li>
</ul>
<p>At this point, we expect you to do a study. What basic features should the system we design have other than the ones here?</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-56"><a id="_idTextAnchor056"/>Defining the content types of your knowledge management system</h2>
<p>Please list all <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>the content types and information you will manage within your knowledge management system. The<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> following are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Document</li>
<li>Schema</li>
<li>Meeting note</li>
<li>Image</li>
<li>Link</li>
<li>Video</li>
<li>Audio</li>
<li>Spreadsheet</li>
<li>Presentation</li>
<li>All kinds of attachments</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of this<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> content will be added to the Confluence pages; some content will originally be located outside and will be made available by the Confluence environment. For <a id="_idIndexMarker110"/>example, we can embed a YouTube video to the Confluence page, but that means that the video gets stored in the Confluence environment. There are three options available when making external content accessible within Confluence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insert into the page</li>
<li>Give a link</li>
<li>Embed (practical for YouTube, Miro, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-57"><a id="_idTextAnchor057"/>Thinking about categorizing content</h2>
<p>We have to organize all content. This way, we can promptly get the correct information we are looking <a id="_idIndexMarker111"/>for. There <a id="_idIndexMarker112"/>are multiple methods for classifying data; you can use one or more. The important thing here is to think about categorizing information as early as possible and make certain decisions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-58"><a id="_idTextAnchor058"/>Thinking about the maintenance of your knowledge management system</h2>
<p>Accumulating<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> content <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>and knowledge is essential for a robust system, but more is needed. It is necessary to constantly organize all the information and content. It is vital to take care of outdated material, add new information, and adapt the relationship between the content and the information according to the conditions of the phase of the project.</p>
<p>Don’t expect these editing jobs to happen by themselves. We suggest you consider how, when, and by whom this will be done.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve raised awareness about information architecture, we can hopefully move on to the next topic and apply what we’ve learned here.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-59"><a id="_idTextAnchor059"/>Planning your Confluence site</h1>
<p>Setting up Confluence<a id="_idIndexMarker115"/> is a straightforward task. However, if you do this within a company, you need careful planning. This way, you can foresee your needs, what you can do with this product, the essential decisions, and the risks.</p>
<p>An environment that hosts the knowledge that a large team develops daily can quickly get out of control if not meticulously designed. Content may become inaccurate or outdated, difficult to find and understand, and even cause information security, compliance, and other legal issues. With good planning, you can avoid most of these risks. If you want to gain resistance against all these risks, we recommend you consider the planning process. This way, you can make the right decisions and establish and maintain a collaborative working platform that your teams will enjoy using, while avoiding confusion and lack of motivation among teammates.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-60"><a id="_idTextAnchor060"/>Introduction to iterative planning</h2>
<p>We live in a <a id="_idIndexMarker116"/>time where everything changes rapidly. For this reason, planning even the smallest detail from the beginning is impossible, and it is also not efficient. We advise that you plan as much as needed; nothing less, nothing more. You should be able to adapt your plan according to the changes you’ll meet.</p>
<p>How much and when we plan depends on <a id="_idIndexMarker117"/>many factors. The company’s experience in Confluence, knowledge management, and collaborative solutions are among the most critical factors.</p>
<p>Here are some scenarios where we believe careful planning is almost certainly necessary:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you are using Confluence for the first time</li>
<li>If you haven’t used any knowledge management or collaboration solutions before</li>
<li>If you are migrating from a different collaboration tool to Confluence</li>
<li>If you are going to make severe changes to the current Confluence environment</li>
<li>If your company is undergoing extreme changes (e.g., new products or teams)</li>
<li>If you are merging with another company</li>
<li>If you are scaling Confluence</li>
<li>If you are migrating from Confluence Server or Confluence Data Center to Confluence Cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Every company’s planning ability and habits are unique. If your company structure is appropriate, we have experienced that agile planning can yield outstanding results in this area, which contains many uncertainties. However, you can make very effective plans with other approaches if you prefer.</p>
<p>In principle, we can give the following advice: It would be beneficial to analyze your conditions and plan only as much as necessary. Here, we’d like to also underline that iterative planning will be helpful. You can prepare the near-term in detail and the mid-term roughly.</p>
<p>Putting what we have planned into practice, testing, using, , taking lessons, and planning the next iteration can help you a lot.</p>
<p>Here are our recommendations that we believe will come in handy during the planning phase:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify the people affected by these studies and establish a good planning team.</li>
<li>Use checklists <a id="_idIndexMarker118"/>and sample questions to make systematic and result-oriented planning. You can have these lists created by your team, find them on the internet, or ask your advisors.</li>
<li>Make your decision register visible to your team.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-61"><a id="_idTextAnchor061"/>Using checklists and guiding questions for better planning</h2>
<p>We will present some<a id="_idIndexMarker119"/> checklists to better prepare you for the planning phase of your Confluence journey.</p>
<h3>Checklist no.1 – Tools</h3>
<p>Use these <a id="_idIndexMarker120"/>questions to clarify your needs before setting up the Atlassian Cloud site and Confluence environment:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_01_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.1 – Checklist no.1</p>
<h3>Checklist no.2 – Additional needs</h3>
<p>Use the following<a id="_idIndexMarker121"/> questions to further clarify your needs:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_02_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.2 – Checklist no.2</p>
<h3>Checklist no.3 – People</h3>
<p>Use the <a id="_idIndexMarker122"/>following questions to think about how you will manage your users and your teams:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.3 – Checklist no.3</p>
<h3>Checklist no.4 – Processes</h3>
<p>Use<a id="_idIndexMarker123"/> the following questions to plan your project from an information security perspective:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_04_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.4 – Checklist no.4</p>
<h3>Checklist no.5 – Contents</h3>
<p>Use the <a id="_idIndexMarker124"/>following questions to gain an idea of the content that will live on your Confluence site:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_05_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.5 – Checklist no.5</p>
<p>Now that we are done with checklists and ready to move forward, let’s discuss how many Confluence spaces you need. It depends on your needs. The following table can give you some inspiration on deciding the number of spaces within your Confluence site:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_06_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.6 – How many Confluence spaces do you need?</p>
<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker125"/>can see from the previous table, we propose creating one organizational space, one space per team, one space per project, one space per person, and one space per product. Remember that a personal space is automatically created for a new user who is added to Confluence.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-62"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Additional tips for more effective planning</h2>
<p>As we mentioned, the<a id="_idIndexMarker126"/> planning continues after you get the system up and running. We recommend that you constantly plan for the next phase. As a planner, the following tips can help you stay up to date:</p>
<ul>
<li>Establish the processes required for regular planning</li>
<li>Research about Confluence</li>
<li>Discover working examples of Confluence</li>
<li>Examine Atlassian’s Cloud Roadmap</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we’ve planned our Confluence site and are now ready to install and configure Confluence.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Installing and configuring Confluence</h1>
<p>Our goal here is to create an Atlassian Cloud site, install Confluence on it, and configure Confluence to meet our needs.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Mastering the terminology – sites and products</h2>
<p>Before installing Confluence, we <a id="_idIndexMarker127"/>present you with two fundamental concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Product</li>
<li>Atlassian Cloud site</li>
</ul>
<p>First, Confluence is an Atlassian product like others such as Jira, Trello, Bitbucket, and so on.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Atlassian Cloud products reside within an Atlassian Cloud site. Your Confluence product must therefore be installed on an Atlassian Cloud site. An Atlassian Cloud site generally hosts multiple products such as Confluence, Jira Software, Jira Service Management, et cetera.</p>
<p>If you already<a id="_idIndexMarker128"/> have an Atlassian Cloud product such as Jira, you can easily add Confluence alongside this<a id="_idIndexMarker129"/> product in the same Atlassian Cloud site. If you don’t have an Atlassian Cloud site, you should create one. Every Atlassian Cloud site has a URL (for example, <code>myremote.atlassian.net</code> or <code>myatlassiancloudsite.atlassian.net</code>).</p>
<p>The next screenshot shows how to create an Atlassian cloud site and install Confluence on it:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_07_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.7 – Creating an Atlassian site</p>
<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker130"/> can see in the previous screenshot, you need only an email address and a name to create a fresh Confluence environment on a new Atlassian Cloud site.</p>
<p>If you do not have an Atlassian Cloud site, you should create one now. First, you need a unique site URL where Confluence will be accessible. When your site is ready, you can install Confluence on it.</p>
<p>Each Atlassian Cloud site has a unique web address. We advise you to be careful when choosing this address. You have the right to change this address three times, and changing it brings risks. Remember that you won’t be able to reuse previous URLs.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Installing Confluence</h2>
<p>Follow these<a id="_idIndexMarker131"/> instructions to install Confluence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Visit <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence</a>.</li>
<li>Choose <strong class="bold">Start my free </strong><strong class="bold">30-day trial</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Your Confluence<a id="_idIndexMarker132"/> installation will start when you click the <strong class="bold">Start my free 30-day trial</strong> button shown in the following screenshot. The process is relatively straightforward:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_08_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.8 – Start my free 30-day trial</p>
<p>The interface shown in the preceding screenshot will guide you on whether to create a site first or install Confluence on an existing site.</p>
<p>Remember that you can try Confluence <a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Premium for free for 30 days.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Comparison between Standard and Premium plans</h2>
<p>In terms <a id="_idIndexMarker133"/>of the topics discussed in this chapter, there isn’t a significant difference between the Standard and Premium plans. However, it’s worth noting that the <strong class="bold">Copy Space Permissions</strong> feature is exclusive to the Premium plan. Being on the Premium plan enables you to copy permissions from one space to another, which is a handy tool for saving time and avoiding errors.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Upgrading to the Premium plan</h2>
<p>You are<a id="_idIndexMarker134"/> automatically included in the Free plan when you install Confluence for the first time. We highly recommend the Premium plan to perform the transactions covered in this book. You can easily upgrade Confluence to the Standard or Premium plan using the <strong class="bold">Select Standard</strong> or <strong class="bold">Select Premium</strong> buttons shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_09_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.9 – Select a Free, Standard, or Premium Confluence plan</p>
<p>As you can see in the previous screenshot, there are three plans available: Free, Standard, and Premium. By default, you take the Free plan when you install Confluence for the first time, but you can always select the Standard or Premium plan later.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">With Standard and Premium plans, you can try the product for a certain period; however, you should fill out your credit card information as soon as possible so that the service is not interrupted.</p>
<p class="callout">You cannot switch to the Enterprise plan here; you must contact Atlassian for that.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Understanding the different types of administrators</h2>
<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker135"/>want to provide you with a summary of the different administrative roles associated with Atlassian Confluence Cloud.</p>
<p>In Atlassian Confluence Cloud, there are four different types of administrators, each with their own set of permissions and capabilities:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Site administrators</strong>: They <a id="_idIndexMarker136"/>have the highest level of<a id="_idIndexMarker137"/> permissions and can manage global settings across all Atlassian products in the cloud instance (e.g., Jira, Confluence, etc.). They can manage users and groups, billing and subscriptions, and other site-wide settings.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Confluence administrators</strong>: They<a id="_idIndexMarker138"/> have <a id="_idIndexMarker139"/>administrative rights specifically for Confluence. They can manage spaces, global permissions, and configure Confluence settings, but they don’t have access to site-wide settings or other Atlassian products.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Space administrators</strong>: They <a id="_idIndexMarker140"/>have administrative<a id="_idIndexMarker141"/> rights for a specific Confluence space. They can manage pages, permissions, and settings for that space only.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Organization administrators</strong>: They can manage Atlassian accounts, security settings, and<a id="_idIndexMarker142"/> domain verification<a id="_idIndexMarker143"/> for the entire organization, but they don’t have administrative rights in Confluence or any other Atlassian products unless explicitly granted.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember that Confluence Cloud has different permission settings compared to Confluence Server and Data Center, so make sure to check the Atlassian documentation for the latest information as it might change over time.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>Managing technical and billing contacts</h2>
<p>We <a id="_idIndexMarker144"/>recommend that you specify <strong class="bold">Technical Contacts</strong> and <strong class="bold">Billing Contacts</strong> carefully. You can add more than one person to either category, and both categories must have a primary contact.</p>
<p>Technical contacts<a id="_idIndexMarker145"/> are the people who will seek support directly from Atlassian. The primary technical contact’s address information (including VAT) will appear on your invoices.</p>
<p>Billing contacts<a id="_idIndexMarker146"/> are the people who will have <a id="_idIndexMarker147"/>access to billing-related sections. Here, you can add people who will be able to see the invoice history.</p>
<p>You can update both contacts via the <strong class="bold">Manage Contacts</strong> button accessible at: <a href="https://my.atlassian.com/">https://my.atlassian.com/</a></p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_10_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.10 – Managing technical and billing contacts</p>
<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker148"/> can <a id="_idIndexMarker149"/>see in the previous image, it is easy to <a id="_idIndexMarker150"/>manage the <a id="_idIndexMarker151"/>technical and billing contacts for your Atlassian Cloud site. Once you set up the site contact details, their names and email addresses will be visible in the <strong class="bold">Billing details</strong> section that you can see in the next screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_11_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.11 – Modifying billing details</p>
<p>As you can see in <a id="_idIndexMarker152"/>the previous screenshot, you can send<a id="_idIndexMarker153"/> copies of invoices to<a id="_idIndexMarker154"/> another<a id="_idIndexMarker155"/> address such as that of the accounting department. Here, you can also add a payment method for your monthly or annual subscription.</p>
<p>To access the <strong class="bold">Billing</strong> screen, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the gear-shaped button in the top-right corner of the screen.</li>
<li>In the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu, click on the <strong class="bold">Billing</strong> button in the <strong class="bold">Atlassian </strong><strong class="bold">Admin</strong> tab.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> menu is depicted in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_12_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.12 – Accessing billing operations through the Atlassian settings</p>
<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker156"/>previous <a id="_idIndexMarker157"/>screenshot, you can see what you can do in the <strong class="bold">Billing</strong> section: update your<a id="_idIndexMarker158"/> billing details, manage<a id="_idIndexMarker159"/> your subscriptions, and more. You can see the interface that opens when you press the <strong class="bold">Billing</strong> button in the next screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_13_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.13 – Billing preview</p>
<p>You can see the list of Atlassian applications and plugins installed on your Atlassian site in the interface shown in the previous screenshot. Here, you can access the billing details interface by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> button in the Confluence row.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>Configuring basic security settings</h2>
<p>Atlassian<a id="_idIndexMarker160"/> provides an essential part of the security of the system. However, it would be a mistake to assume that the responsibility lies entirely with Atlassian. You can find more detailed information on sharing responsibility later in the book.</p>
<p>When<a id="_idIndexMarker161"/> starting Confluence, it is helpful to go through some basic security settings immediately and configure them according to your needs. At Atlassian, there is a security trail from the general to the specific. We will go on this path too. Here, we will configure the general settings that concern the whole system; we’ll look at more detailed, pinpointed security settings later in the book.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>Configuring the default permissions</h2>
<p>Spaces are <a id="_idIndexMarker162"/>frequently used concepts in the Confluence ecosystem. All content on Confluence is located within a space. For this reason, we attach great importance to the security of the spaces.</p>
<p>The default settings <a id="_idIndexMarker163"/>determine the access settings with which a new space created on Confluence will be activated. After you create a space, you don’t want this space to stand up with inappropriate access settings. Although you can change these settings after you create the space, this has many disadvantages in practice. For example, during a busy period, you can forget to adjust the security settings. For this reason, unauthorized people may access the space or take some erroneous actions. If you are deleting, modifying, or exporting content, manually updating these settings will be a waste of time. During this process, users may experience access problems. That’s why we set the default settings once, and then we usually never touch them. You can review the <strong class="bold">Default Space Permissions</strong> interface in the next screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_14_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.14 – Viewing default space permissions</p>
<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker164"/> previous screenshot, you can see the permissions that will be automatically granted to user groups when a new space is created.</p>
<p>The default settings <a id="_idIndexMarker165"/>will depend entirely on company policy. Some companies want a new space to be visible to everyone when it is created, while others wish for the new space not to be seen by everyone and for authorizations to be given individually. These companies have strict security policies. Others may be in the middle. Default settings are not just about view permissions; they include settings for deletion, modification, exporting, and so on.</p>
<p>If you want to make changes to the default space permissions, you should click on the <strong class="bold">Edit Permissions</strong> button located at the top-right of the screen. In the next screenshot, you can see the interface where you can set the default space permissions:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_15_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.15 – Configuring default space permissions</p>
<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker166"/> previous screenshot, you can see the permissions you can grant to user groups. This interface is almost identical to the interface where <a id="_idIndexMarker167"/>you set space permissions. The only difference is that the settings you make here affect not just a single space, but all spaces that will be created in the future. It is worth noting that the changes you make here do not affect spaces that were created previously.</p>
<p>At this point, we would like to give you an important reminder. Detailed page and space permissions are only available in the Standard and Premium plans. If you cannot adjust these settings, you are probably not on the Premium plan yet. Please make sure that you are on the Premium plan.</p>
<p>The space permissions are explained in the following table:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_16_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 2.16 – Definitions of space permissions</p>
<p>We are <a id="_idIndexMarker168"/>setting up Confluence for the very first <a id="_idIndexMarker169"/>time. Currently, our user management groups still need to be finalized. For this reason, it would be beneficial to come back here once you’re done with all user management groups.</p>
<p>One of the most critical questions is: Will anyone with access to Confluence be able to access every created space? The answer is no. You can define granular restrictions on Confluence. Let’s learn how to manage them.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Configuring global permissions</h2>
<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker170"/>access <a id="_idIndexMarker171"/>global permissions, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> button at the top-right of the screen.</li>
<li>In the left menu, click on the <strong class="bold">Global permissions</strong> button under the <strong class="bold">Security</strong> heading.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see the <strong class="bold">Global permissions</strong> interface in the next screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_17_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.17 – Viewing global permissions</p>
<p>In a <a id="_idIndexMarker172"/>moment, we will edit the global permissions <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>that are visible in the previous image. There are four tabs at the top of this interface:</p>
<ul>
<li>User groups</li>
<li>Jira Service Management access</li>
<li>Anonymous access</li>
<li>Apps</li>
</ul>
<p>The first tab contains the global permissions for the user management groups. Global permissions can’t be assigned to individual users, only to the group.</p>
<p>You can decide who can create a personal space or a company space. Personal and company spaces are for very different purposes. According to your company policies, you can easily set the global permissions for creating spaces in Confluence. One of the most common scenarios is where everybody can create a personal space, but only some people can generate company spaces. This limitation generally prevents creating spaces unless there is a significant need.</p>
<p>Please be aware that when someone creates a new space, they automatically become an admin for that space.</p>
<p>If you are using Jira Service Management to serve internal or external customers, you can add a helpful knowledge base feature to your system using Confluence. Your customers can access the content prepared from the Jira Service Management interface. As you might expect, these contents are kept on Confluence.</p>
<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>section on global permissions is precisely about this <a id="_idIndexMarker175"/>feature. You provide your customers with access to content on Confluence, even if they do not have Confluence licenses.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Global permissions</strong> interface for JSM is depicted in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_18_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.18 – Viewing global permissions for Jira Service Management</p>
<p>You can make some of your Confluence spaces open to everyone. In this way, people who do not have a Confluence license can access your content. In this type of global permission, you can allow spaces to be made open to the world. We recommend that the company policy is determined and implemented immediately.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Global permissions</strong> interface<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> for anonymous <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>access is depicted in the following screenshot:</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.19 – Viewing global permissions for anonymous access</p>
<p>The last setting of this section is related to applications. Many applications run on Confluence. Some of them are Confluence’s applications. Also, there may be applications that you have installed. You can set the permissions of these applications here:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.20 – Viewing global permissions for apps</p>
<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> previous screenshot, you can see that two <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>applications, <strong class="bold">Chat Notifications</strong> and <strong class="bold">Microsoft Teams for Confluence Cloud</strong>, have the <strong class="bold">Create </strong><strong class="bold">Space</strong> permission.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Discovering security configuration</h2>
<p>Confluence<a id="_idIndexMarker180"/> provides an interface to configure<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> the settings for user management, site security, and user privacy. To access the <strong class="bold">Edit Security Configuration</strong> interface, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> button at the top-right of the screen.</li>
<li>On the left-side menu, click on the <strong class="bold">Security Configuration</strong> button under the <strong class="bold">Security</strong> heading.</li>
</ol>
<p>You may not <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>choose <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>to change the default values of the security settings in this section. However, we recommend that you go through all the settings:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_21_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.21 – Editing security configuration</p>
<p>You<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> can review the settings under the <strong class="bold">Security and Privacy</strong> heading as seen in the previous screenshot. To <a id="_idIndexMarker185"/>change these settings, you should click the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> button in the top-right. We will examine the security settings in more detail in the security-related chapter of our book. However, we still want to explain some of the settings here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Maximum RSS </strong><strong class="bold">items</strong>: You can limit the maximum number of items an RSS feed can request.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">RSS timeout</strong>: This is the time in seconds that is allowed to create each RSS feed. Any items rendered within the timeout will still be returned.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Page timeout</strong>: You can set the time in seconds that is allowed to render the content of each wiki page. Pages taking longer to render will display a timeout error to the user. The default is 120 seconds.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">CAPTCHA on login</strong>: You can set the maximum number of failed login attempts before enabling CAPTCHA.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Hide </strong><strong class="bold">external links from search engines</strong>: You can prevent spammers from posting <a id="_idIndexMarker186"/>malicious links by preventing <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>search engines from following the site.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Anonymous </strong><strong class="bold">a</strong><strong class="bold">ccess to remote API</strong>: You can disable anonymous users from accessing Confluence remotely.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>Accessing the General Configuration section</h2>
<p>It’s time <a id="_idIndexMarker188"/>to discover the configuration options available within Confluence. These configurations may not be<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> needed at the beginning of your Confluence journey, but you will surely need to come back here to adapt Confluence to your company’s needs.</p>
<h3>Formatting and international settings</h3>
<p>You<a id="_idIndexMarker190"/> can modify formatting and international settings by accessing the following:</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Settings</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">General Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Formatting and </strong><strong class="bold">International Settings</strong></p>
<p>You can customize the time and date formatting on your Confluence site:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.22 – Viewing formatting and international settings</p>
<p>As you can<a id="_idIndexMarker191"/> see in the previous screenshot, you can easily edit formatting and international settings for your Confluence environment. Please be careful when modifying these settings, because they will affect every user on your Confluence site.</p>
<h3>Configuring attachment settings</h3>
<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker192"/> configure the attachment settings by accessing the following:</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Settings</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">General Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Attachment Settings</strong></p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Attachment Settings</strong> interface is displayed as follows:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.23 – Attachment settings</p>
<p>As you <a id="_idIndexMarker193"/>can see in the previous screenshot, Confluence gives you the ability to set the maximum size for each attachment uploaded to the site and the maximum number of attachments per upload.</p>
<h3>Setting the default language</h3>
<p>You can set <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>the default language for your Confluence site by accessing the following:</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Settings</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Language</strong></p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Language</strong> interface is displayed as follows:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.24 – Language configuration</p>
<h3>Modifying the site logo and the favicon</h3>
<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker195"/> change your Confluence site logo and title by accessing the following:</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Settings</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Look and Feel</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Site Logo </strong><strong class="bold">and Favicon</strong>.</p>
<p>The interface is displayed as follows:</p>

</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.25 – Setting site title and logo</p>
<p>In the interface<a id="_idIndexMarker196"/> shown in the previous screenshot, if you enter a name for your site (for example, your company’s name) and press the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button, your company’s name will always be visible on your site to all users. The title is helpful if you regularly work on different Confluence sites. The site title will be displayed as follows:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_26_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.26 – Site title</p>
<p>In the previous <a id="_idIndexMarker197"/>screenshot, you can see that <strong class="bold">Our company</strong> is located immediately to the right of the <strong class="bold">Confluence</strong> button in the menu at the top of the screen. If you have access to multiple Confluence sites, this phrase will help you identify at a glance which Confluence site you are working on.</p>
<h3>Discovering further configurations</h3>
<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker198"/> access the <strong class="bold">Further Configuration</strong> interface by accessing the following:</p>
<p><strong class="bold">Settings</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Further Configuration</strong></p>
<p>There are some other settings in this section that we’ll go over. You might need to change their default settings only.</p>
<p>By default, Confluence emails a copy of notifications to users. It’s up to you to turn it off. Some companies may want to turn off email notifications for security reasons. Companies that only receive notifications through Slack may also want to turn this option off. A similar restriction can be made for push notifications sent to mobile applications.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you may also want to avoid likes or reactions on any content (page, comment, etc.) on Confluence. In this case, you can disable this feature.</p>
<p>The following screenshot displays the <strong class="bold">Further </strong><strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> interface:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_27_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.27 – Further configuration</p>
<p>We have <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>installed Confluence and configured its basic settings. Now, it’s time to discuss managing users.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Managing users</h1>
<p>In this<a id="_idIndexMarker200"/> section, we will share the main principles of user management; then, we will immediately move on to practical applications.</p>
<p>Users will be among the most dynamic components of this system. The reasons for this are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>New users arrive</li>
<li>Users leave</li>
<li>Some users’ teams and roles change</li>
<li>User needs change</li>
<li>Company rules change</li>
</ul>
<p>The system<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> we will establish must be capable of responding to all this dynamism. In addition to this feature, the system we will install should allow the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We should be able to easily make and maintain authorization according to teams, groups, and individuals. We should be able to ensure data security and privacy easily.</li>
<li>When designing user management, it is always necessary to foresee. Of course, the current structure of the team is fundamental. However, when anticipating the changes the team may undergo and expectations from Confluence, we must design a sustainable user management system. Otherwise, we may hesitate making the slightest change in the system.</li>
<li>With any access problem, we should be able to trace it easily and get to the root cause of the problem quickly.</li>
<li>We should be able to distribute user management to different types of administrators. We should leave as little work as possible to the primary manager of Confluence, especially the site and organization managers.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will now include users in the system. At this point, users may be in one of the following three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>People who have never had an Atlassian account before</li>
<li>People who have used an Atlassian product before and have an Atlassian ID</li>
<li>People with a managed Atlassian ID</li>
</ul>
<p>We will focus on the first two types of users here. Managed accounts with an identity provider service will be explained in detail later.</p>
<p>Here, we will invite users to Confluence:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_28_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.28 – Accessing the list of users</p>
<p>The following <a id="_idIndexMarker202"/>screenshot shows how you can easily invite users:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_29_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.29 – Inviting users to Confluence</p>
<p>To invite users to the system, you<a id="_idIndexMarker203"/> must complete the following fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Email addresses</strong>: Enter the email addresses of the users you invite. This field is required.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Product</strong>: You determine what type of user this group will have and in which product. For example, in the previous screenshot, this group has a Confluence license and only user (not admin) rights.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Group memberships</strong>: You can assign a group when inviting the user. This field is not required and can be filled in later.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Personalize invitation email</strong>: You can customize the invitation email that will be sent to the user.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Managing user groups</h2>
<p>To manage<a id="_idIndexMarker204"/> user groups, follow the subsequent steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> button at the top-right of the screen.</li>
<li>In the left menu, click on the <strong class="bold">User Management</strong> button under the <strong class="bold">Site </strong><strong class="bold">Administration</strong> heading.</li>
<li>Click <strong class="bold">Groups</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can see the <strong class="bold">User Management</strong> interface in the next screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_30_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.30 – Managing user groups</p>
<p>You can view the list of all groups as shown in the screenshot. You can also see the number of people in each group, the number of products the group has access to, and other details.</p>
<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>determining user group names, a naming standard is necessary. Otherwise, you may not find what you are looking for and managing user groups can become tricky.</p>
<p>To edit a group’s name, follow the subsequent steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click <strong class="bold">Show details</strong> to the right of a group name.</li>
<li>Click the <strong class="bold">…</strong> button at the top-right of the screen.</li>
<li>Enter the group’s new name.</li>
<li>Click <strong class="bold">Save Changes</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Edit group name</strong> dialog is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_31_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.31 – Edit group name</p>
<p>As you can<a id="_idIndexMarker206"/> see in the preceding screenshot, editing a group’s name is a beta feature. It can impact products in unexpected ways, depending on your group’s product settings.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Create group</strong> interface will be displayed as follows:</p>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.32 – Creating a user group</p>
<p>When <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>creating a new group, you can enter three pieces of information:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Group’s name</strong>: Specify the name of the group.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Group’s members</strong>: If you wish, specify the group members when creating the group. You can also do this later.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Group’s description</strong>: We recommend you write the group’s purpose in this field. We recommend that you do so carefully and without leaving it blank. This way, you can manage user groups more easily.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>Setting up spaces – team, project, company, and personal</h1>
<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker208"/>will increase our knowledge about Confluence spaces. Then, without going into too much detail, we will learn how to create four <a id="_idIndexMarker209"/>different<a id="_idIndexMarker210"/> kinds of spaces <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>with specific purposes. The following sections will cover the details of configuring settings and creating content.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>What spaces should you create?</h2>
<p>Any content you <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>create or bring together on Confluence must be in a space. You will have many spaces that serve different purposes according to your company’s needs.</p>
<p>As a result of your studies in information architecture, you can have a prominent list of spaces. In some cases (especially if yours is a small company), there may not be enough content to accommodate domains early in the process; however, it is helpful to foresee and open these spaces at the beginning of the process.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>What is the life cycle of a domain?</h2>
<p>During the work <a id="_idIndexMarker213"/>of information architecture, it becomes clear in which cases you need to open a new space. You can create a new space when a new project starts, a new team is formed, or a new employee joins the company. Also, new spaces are created, when necessary, in line with the rules of your company, and the number of active spaces on Confluence increases.</p>
<p>Once a need is met, it is necessary to close the related space. Otherwise, Confluence can turn into a chaotic environment in a short time. Here are a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can close a personal space when an employee leaves your company</li>
<li>You can close a project space when the related project is completed</li>
<li>You can close a team space when the connected team is dismissed</li>
</ul>
<p>So, what does it mean to close a space? It usually happens in one of three different ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>The space is frozen. In other words, no changes are allowed to be made to the content of the space. In this way, people who want can access the content in the space, but they cannot make any changes in it.</li>
<li>The space can be archived, so the content of the space is not lost, but is accessible when necessary. It is also hidden from most users. In this way, Confluence can be kept more organized.</li>
<li>The space can be deleted completely.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the spaces we will create will serve very different purposes, they have many standard features because they are all typical Confluence spaces, and all use the same infrastructure.</p>
<p>In this section, you<a id="_idIndexMarker214"/> will repeat the same operations several times to create the spaces. This way, you <a id="_idIndexMarker215"/>will have your company’s first spaces and gain practice <a id="_idIndexMarker216"/>in the process.</p>
<p>The spaces we <a id="_idIndexMarker217"/>will create are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Team space</li>
<li>Project space</li>
<li>Company space</li>
<li>Personal space</li>
</ul>
<p>In this section, we <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>will create the spaces and configure the basic settings. We will leave the details until later in the book.</p>
<p>We create all spaces in much the same way. For this reason, we will explain how to create a space once. We expect you to then apply what you learn here as you create the other three spaces.</p>
<p>Follow the <strong class="bold">Spaces</strong> &gt; <strong class="bold">Create a space</strong> path from the menu at the top of the screen to create a new space:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_33_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.33 – Discovering the Spaces menu item</p>
<p>As seen in the preceding figure, you can easily access the basic operations related to the spaces from the top menu.</p>
<p>First, we want to <a id="_idIndexMarker219"/>create a team space. Therefore, select a space template to get started quickly. This interface is shown in the next screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_34_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.34 – Creating a new space</p>
<p>In the preceding screenshot, you can see Confluence’s <strong class="bold">Create a new space</strong> interface. There are more than ten different space templates here. You can choose the one you want, or you can opt for a blank space template. Remember that these are just the starting points to save you time. You can customize your space according to your preferences.</p>
<p>To continue adding details to your space, first select your template and then click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>. You will have to add some details, as shown in the next screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_35_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.35 – Adding details to your new space</p>
<p>As shown in the preceding<a id="_idIndexMarker220"/> screenshot, there are four fields that need your input:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Space icon</strong>: You can choose an icon from a library or upload an image.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Name your space</strong>: We recommend giving a name that is easy to understand and according to a specific rule. This way, you can easily distinguish all space names from each other and ensure consistency.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Permissions</strong>: Here, you can define the visibility of the space.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Identify this space with a key</strong>: We recommend entering a unique character string that conforms to a specific standard. For example, you may prefer to use the TeamAlpha or TeamBeta format so that it is immediately recognizable as a team space.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that the<a id="_idIndexMarker221"/> space’s key cannot be changed once the space is created. This key will appear on the space’s URL as a unique identifier.</p>
<p>If you decide to customize your space key, remember that the following applies to each one:</p>
<ul>
<li>It must be unique</li>
<li>It can contain any alphanumeric characters (a-z, 0-9)</li>
<li>It can be up to 255 characters long</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s examine the space permissions, as shown in the next screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_02_36_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.36 – Setting space permissions</p>
<p>As shown in the <a id="_idIndexMarker222"/>preceding screenshot, there are three choices for the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> field:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Only visible to me</strong>: You can usually choose this setting in personal spaces. Only you can see this space.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Default permissions</strong>: You can use the default space permissions we set up in the previous sections of this chapter.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Copy permissions from another space</strong>: You can use permissions from another space here. For example, this setting can save you much time if you are creating all your team spaces one after the other. You can configure the privileges of the first team space as you wish; you can then clone these settings when creating the subsequent team spaces.</li>
</ul>

<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 2.37 – Configuring the parameters of the space to be created</p>
<p>As you can <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>see, we’ve filled in the basic information about the team space we will create using the preceding suggestions.</p>
<p>We will review the space settings in detail in the following sections. However, we want to proceed here with setting the space category. We will assign categories according to the space types we have created.</p>
<p>We recommend that you assign a category to each space you create. The categories are listed in the following table:</p>
