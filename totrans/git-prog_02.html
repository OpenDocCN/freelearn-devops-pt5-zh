    <h1 id="_idParaDest-35" class="chapterTitle">Creating Your Repository</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, you will learn how to create an account on GitHub, and how to create and clone your first repository so that you have a link between the repository on your computer and that on GitHub.</p>
    <p class="normal">This chapter will cover:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Creating your repository</li>
      <li class="bullet">Git pull</li>
      <li class="bullet">Push me, pull you</li>
      <li class="bullet">Starting at the command line</li>
      <li class="bullet">Commits – best practices</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">We'll start by creating your GitHub repository.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-36" class="title">Creating your repository</h1>
    <p class="normal">There are a number of different ways to create your repository. We'll cover creating a repository on GitHub and cloning it to your disk, as this is the most common way.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-37" class="title">Creating your repository on GitHub first</h2>
    <p class="normal">Your first step is to register with GitHub. Go to <a href="http://github.com">http://github.com</a> and click <strong class="screenText">Sign Up</strong>. Fill in your username (it will tell you if the name is taken) and your email and it may ask you to verify that you are a human. Assuming you are, click <strong class="screenText">Create Account</strong>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Fill out their micro-survey and click <strong class="screenText">Create Account</strong>. You will be asked to verify your email, and once you do, you'll see the (one-time) opening page asking what you want to do first. Choose<strong class="screenText"> Create a repository</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.1: Getting started with GitHub</p>
    <p class="normal">If you <a id="_idIndexMarker042"/>already have an account, sign in and press <strong class="screenText">New Repository</strong>. You may not find this at first glance, in which case click the big plus sign in the corner.</p>
    <p class="normal">Either way, you will be brought to the <strong class="screenText">Create A New Repository</strong> page. The first job is to give your new repository a name. I'll use <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ProGitForProgrammers</code>. Feel free to use any name you want as long as GitHub doesn't complain that the name is taken.</p>
    <p class="normal">Now it is time to fill in the form:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.2: Creating the repository</p>
    <p class="normal">Start by entering a short description of your project. Next, and very importantly, choose whether you <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>want this repository to be public (anyone can see it) or private (only people you invite can see it).</p>
    <p class="normal">I strongly recommend checking <strong class="screenText">Add a README file</strong>. This will be what is shown to users when they come to your repository. You can fix the file up later using Markdown.</p>
    <p class="normal">Be sure to add a <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.gitignore</code> file. This tells Git which files to ignore when checking your files into the repository. This can be very important so that you don't overwrite another programmer's metadata files. Click the dropdown and admire how many languages are supported; for C# I recommend you search for and choose Visual Studio.</p>
    <p class="normal">If your repository is public, be certain to choose a license for the code. I chose the MIT License. You can learn more about this license at <a href="https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT">https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT</a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">That's it! You are ready to click <strong class="screenText">Create repository</strong>. When you do, you'll be brought to the home page for your new GitHub repository:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.3: Initial view of your repository</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice that <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>you have the three files you asked for, and that you can see a preview of the README as well as the description you entered.</p>
    <p class="normal">Right now, this repository exists only on the server. You want to put a copy on your disk so that you can add code and use commands to keep them in sync. Therefore you will "clone" the repository; that is, you'll make an exact copy of the remote repository in your local repository.</p>
    <p class="normal">How you will do this will depend on whether you are using the command line, Visual Studio, or a GUI.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-38" class="title">Cloning to your computer – command line</h2>
    <p class="normal">Cloning to your local repository is easy. Open your terminal (or PowerShell) and change the directory <a id="_idIndexMarker045"/>to where you want the repository to go (in my case GitHub/the command line).</p>
    <p class="normal">Switch back to your GitHub repo on <a href="http://GitHub.com">GitHub.com</a>, and see the green button in the upper right-hand corner marked <strong class="screenText">Code</strong>. Click that button and a small dialog box will open. Choose <strong class="screenText">HTTPS</strong> unless you know you have <strong class="screenText">SSH</strong> (as I do). In either case, click on the clipboard icon to copy the address:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.4: Copying the address of the repo</p>
    <p class="normal">Return to the command line, enter <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">git clone</code>, and then paste in the address:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git clone git@github.com:JesseLiberty/ProGitForProgrammers.git
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">You should see something like this:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.5: Cloning at the command line</p>
    <p class="normal">Change <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>the directory to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ProGitForProgrammers</code> and you'll see that the three files that were on the server are now here as well:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.6: Files in the directory</p>
    <p class="normal">Now let's take a look at how to do this in Visual Studio.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-39" class="title">Cloning to your computer – visual studio</h2>
    <p class="normal">Go to your directory (in my case <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitHub</code>) and make a directory called <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">VisualStudio</code>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Open Visual <a id="_idIndexMarker047"/>Studio with no project. Select <strong class="screenText">File | Clone Repository</strong>. Fill in the fields and click <strong class="screenText">Clone</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_07.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.7: Cloning to your local repository using Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">A few seconds later you will see the three files, now shown in the <strong class="screenText">Solution Explorer</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_08.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.8: Cloned files in Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">There are <a id="_idIndexMarker048"/>a number of ways to clone from a GitHub repository to your own. One way is to use a dedicated GUI tool such as GitHub Desktop.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-40" class="title">Cloning to your computer – GitHub for Desktop</h2>
    <p class="normal">Once again, return <a id="_idIndexMarker049"/>to your root directory (<code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitHub</code>) and make a new directory. This time call it <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitHubDesktop</code>. </p>
    <p class="normal">Now, return to GitHub and click <strong class="screenText">Code</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_09.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.9: Cloning directly through GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice that one of the choices is <strong class="screenText">Open with GitHub Desktop</strong>. Click on that. A dialog will open. The only field you need to fill in is the local path. Click <strong class="screenText">Clone</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_10.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.10: Cloning to GitHub Desktop using HTTP</p>
    <div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Notice that GitHub Desktop wants the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">https</code> URL for your repository.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">You now <a id="_idIndexMarker050"/>have three copies of your original repository, each in its own directory: <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CommandLine</code>, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">VisualStudio</code>, and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitHubDesktop</code>. These might represent three programmers working on the same solution, or various ways for one programmer to choose to clone their project.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-41" class="title">Creating a project</h2>
    <p class="normal">We need a project. Using Visual Studio (or your favorite editor) create a project called <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">ProGitForProgrammers</code> in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CommandLine</code> directory. When you are done, you should have the <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>three original files and a folder for your program. In that folder will be the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">.sln</code> file as well as a folder for the code.</p>
    <p class="normal">Open the command line and navigate to the same directory. When you get there your command line should look something like this:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_11.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.11: The command-line prompt</p>
    <p class="normal">Look at the yellow, where you see <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">+1 ~0 -0</code>. The <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">+1</code> means you've added a file or a directory; the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">~0</code> indicates that no files have been modified; the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">-0</code> indicates that no files have been deleted. Let's see what was added. Enter:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git status
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">You <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>should see something like this:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_12.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.12: Untracked files</p>
    <p class="normal">Git is telling you that you are on the branch <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">main</code> (the only branch for now) and that you have "untracked files" – that is, files that are in the directory but that are not being tracked by Git. If they are untracked, Git can't store them; in fact, Git knows nothing about them. Let's fix that. Enter these commands:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git add ProGitForProgrammers/
git commit -m "First commit – from command line"
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal"><code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">add</code> tells Git that this is a file it should pay attention to and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">commit</code> brings it into the local repository. </p>
    <p class="normal">Every <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">commit</code> must have a message, and if you don't provide one, you'll be prompted by Git to add one. Here I've added it by using the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">-m</code> flag.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once again, all this is happening locally and so GitHub doesn't know about it. We can fix that by pushing our commit up to the server:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git push
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Now if you go to GitHub and refresh the page your project will be there. You can click your way down through the folders, and even into <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code>, to see the code:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_13.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.13: Viewing your code on GitHub</p>
    <p class="normal">Notice <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>in the upper left that it tells you that you are on the <strong class="screenText">main</strong> branch. Next to that is the path to get to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code>. Below that is the message you added, and then the file itself.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-42" class="title">Git pull</h1>
    <p class="normal">Having pushed <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>your commits to the server, other developers may want to pull them to their own directory, to keep in sync.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-43" class="title">Pulling down using GitHub Desktop</h3>
    <p class="normal">Having put the project up on the server, we can simply pull it down into the other locations. For <a id="_idIndexMarker055"/>example, open GitHub Desktop. It will tell you that there have been changes in the repository and helpfully offer a button for you to update your local repo.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you open a file explorer and navigate to the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitHubDesktop</code> directory, you'll see that there is now a replica of the files you pushed from the command line.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-44" class="title">Pulling down to Visual Studio</h3>
    <p class="normal">Click on the <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>Git menu and choose <strong class="screenText">Pull</strong>. Visual Studio is updated with the code from the server. Now all three repositories are up to date. This is the heart of Git:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">Save your files to a local repository</li>
      <li class="bullet">Push your files to the remote repository</li>
      <li class="bullet">Pull down any files that are on the remote repository but not on your local repository</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-45" class="title">Push me, pull you</h1>
    <p class="normal">Generally, you want to push your changes and pull down changes from other developers. Also, generally, you will not be working on the same files, and certainly not in main. We'll <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>discuss how to avoid this in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Merging Branches</em>. For now, we'll just be very careful.</p>
    <p class="normal">Open Visual Studio in the directory <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitHub/VisualStudio/ProGitForProgrammers</code>. Add a line to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs </code>as shown here:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">namespace ProGitForProgrammers
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
           <code style="font-weight: bold;" class="codeHighlighted"/><strong class="hljs-slc">Console.WriteLine("I just added this in Visual Studio");</strong>
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Having made your change, you want to check it in. Since we are in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">VisualStudio</code> directory, we'll do the work right within Visual Studio. Click the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Git</code> menu and choose <strong class="screenText">Commit or Stash</strong>. A Git window will open as a tab next to <strong class="screenText">Solution Explorer</strong>. Enter a commit message and press <strong class="screenText">Commit All</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_14.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.14: Git window in Visual Studio</p>
    <div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Note that if you drop down the <strong class="screenText">Commit All</strong> menu, you have a number of shortcuts for adding, committing, and pushing your changes.</p>
    </div>
    <p class="normal">As you <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>can see, and will see often in this book, you can do almost anything in Visual Studio that you can do at the command line.</p>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-46" class="title">Pushing to the server</h3>
    <p class="normal">You have now committed your changes to your local repository. The GitHub repository, however, doesn't know <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>about your changes. (You can prove this to yourself by returning to GitHub and drilling down to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code>.)</p>
    <p class="normal">The other programmers' repositories (for example, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CommandLine</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitHubDesktop</code>) are equally oblivious. To disseminate this change, you first push your changes up to the server (GitHub) and then pull them down to the other repositories.</p>
    <p class="normal">From within Visual Studio's Git window, press <strong class="screenText">Staged</strong>. This will stage your changes for committing. Next, click <strong class="screenText">Commit</strong>. This will put your changes into your local repository (be sure to give the commit a meaningful message). </p>
    <p class="normal">Examine the Git window; there is a lot of information:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_15.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.15: The Git window in Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">You are told that the commit was created locally (and locally is the important part!). Below that <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>is the status of your commit. You have one to push up to the server (outgoing) and none to bring down (incoming):</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_16.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.16: Uploading a commit from Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, find the up-pointing arrow in the upper-right corner. Hover over it and you'll see that it says <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Push</code>. Click that button to push your changes to the server. When it is done, it will give you a success message. Ignore the offer to create a pull request for now.</p>
    <p class="normal">Look to the left of your Git menu and see the local history of your commits:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_17.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.17: The history of commits</p>
    <p class="normal">Each dot signals a commit, and next to each dot is your commit message (and now you can see why <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>meaningful commit messages are both hard to write and worth the effort). There is also an indicator that main is pointing to your last commit.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you check GitHub (remember to refresh the page) you will now see the line in <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code>. Make sure you understand why: this is because after we committed the change, we pushed it to the remote repository.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-47" class="title">Downloading the changes at the command line</h2>
    <p class="normal">We created <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>the changes in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">VisualStudio</code> directory. <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CommandLine</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitHubDesktop</code> know nothing of the changes, even though they are now on GitHub.</p>
    <p class="normal">For these directories to know about the changes, you need to pull the changes down.</p>
    <p class="normal">Change directories to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CommandLine</code>. Examine the contents of <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code>; the new line is not there. Open your terminal and enter <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">pull</code>. This will pull any changes from the server to your local repository.</p>
    <p class="normal">The result should look like this:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_18.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.18: Pulling from the remote repository</p>
    <p class="normal">Git is <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>telling you that it formatted and compressed your files and passed them down to your repository. Toward the bottom it says that it used Fast-forward. We'll discuss this in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Merging, Pull Requests, and Handling Merge Conflicts</em>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Take a look at <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code> now in your command directory; the new addition should now be there.</p>
    <div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">Want to do something cool? Open the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code> file before updating. After the update you will see the second <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">WriteLine </code>pop into view. What is actually happening is that the code that was in your directory is replaced by the new code on the pull. </p>
    </div>
    <h3 id="_idParaDest-48" class="title">Downloading the changes using GitHub Desktop</h3>
    <p class="normal">Change directories to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitHubDesktop</code> and open the GitHub Desktop program. It will give you a <a id="_idIndexMarker064"/>lot of information about the status of your repository (<strong class="screenText">No Local Changes</strong>) and it will automatically check and inform you that there is one commit to update your local repository with:</p>

    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.19: The view from the remote repository</p>
    <p class="normal">Go ahead <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>and click <strong class="screenText">Pull origin</strong>. It does the pull, and the button disappears. Check your code; the change should now be in your <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs </code>(and is recorded in your local repository).</p>
    <div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-">All three local repositories and the server repository are now in sync. </p>
    </div>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-49" class="title">Starting at the command line</h1>
    <p class="normal">You can start the process at any of our repositories. Last time we started in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">VisualStudio</code> repository <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>and then pulled the changes down to the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CommandLine</code> and <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">GitDesktop</code> repos. This time, let's start at the command line.</p>
    <p class="normal">Open Visual Studio and point it to the project in your <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">CommandLine</code> directory. Just to be certain, right-click on <strong class="screenText">Solution</strong>, select <strong class="screenText">Open Folder in File Explorer</strong>, and make sure you are in the right directory.</p>
    <p class="normal">To keep this example very simple, we'll just add another line to <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program.cs</code>:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {

        Console.WriteLine("I just added this in Visual Studio");
        Console.WriteLine("I just added this in the command line repo");
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Normally you would make many more changes before checking in, but again, this is a demo and we're more interested in using Git than we are in fussing with this silly program. Save all your files and at the command line get the status by entering:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git status
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This will give you output that looks like this:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_20.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.20: The command line indicating one file has been modified</p>
    <p class="normal">The key piece <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>of information is the modified file. That is just as it should be, as that is the file we modified. You can now add it to the index and then commit it:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git add ProGitForProgrammers/ProGitForProgrammers/Program.cs
git commit -m "Add writeline indicating we are in command line"
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">On the other hand, you can combine these two steps with the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">-a</code> flag:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git commit -a -m "Add writeline indicating we are in command line"
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">You will want to draw a distinction between untracked files and modified files. Untracked files are outside of Git and cannot be manipulated inside Git until they are added; modified files are tracked by Git but have changed since the last commit.</p>
    <p class="normal">If we are happy with the commit we've added, we can (optionally) push it to the server: </p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_21.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.21: Pushing our commit to the remote repository</p>
    <p class="normal">We'll want <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>to do that because we want to share this code with the other programmers.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-50" class="title">Pulling to GitHub Desktop</h2>
    <p class="normal">Switching to GitHub Desktop, we see that it already knows there is something to pull, as we saw <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>last time. (If it doesn't, push the <strong class="screenText">Fetch</strong> button, which will go to the server to see if there is anything to bring back.)</p>
    <p class="normal">That's two repos that are identical, but the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">VisualStudio</code> repo is not yet up to date. Let's return to Visual Studio in the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">VisualStudio</code> folder.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-51" class="title">Pulling to Visual Studio</h2>
    <p class="normal">Open the <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>Git menu item, and select <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Pull</code>. Watch your source code and see the third line pop into existence. Once again, the three local repositories and the remote repo are all in sync.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-52" class="title">Commits – best practices</h1>
    <p class="normal">Like everything <a id="_idIndexMarker071"/>else in programming, best practices in commits are, to some degree, controversial. The first issue is frequency.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-53" class="title">How often should I commit?</h2>
    <p class="normal">There are <a id="_idIndexMarker072"/>those who say a commit should be atomic: representing exactly one unit of work (one task, one bug fix). No more and no less. So, according to this line of thought, if you are in the middle of work and you get called away, you should not commit, but you should use the stash. The stash is an area where you can put files that you want to come back to later. You can name sets of files that you stash, and then pick the one you want to restore by name.</p>
    <p class="normal">This is a defensible position, but I hold the opposite: commit early and commit often.</p>
    <p class="normal">Commits are cheap and fast in Git, and interactive rebase (see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Interactive Rebasing</em>) allows you to "squash" commits together. Therefore, if you are working on a feature and you make five <a id="_idIndexMarker073"/>interim commits before you are done, you'll have the opportunity to squash them into a single commit with a single message. This is the best of both worlds: you secure your interim work with a commit, and you present only one commit (rather than five) to the server.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-54" class="title">Keep your commit history clean</h2>
    <p class="normal">The first way that a programmer reviews your code is to look at the list of commits and then dive <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>into those that are interesting. A good history of commits with well-written messages is a delight to review. A long, tedious history with meaningless messages is only slightly more fun than eating glass.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-55" class="title">A note on commit messages</h2>
    <p class="normal">As you will see later in this book, commit messages are very important for anyone (including you) reviewing <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>your commit history. By convention, commit messages should be in the imperative, and should tell you exactly what is in that commit.</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Fixing some files                        // bad
Fix WriteLine in helloworld.cs           // good
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">In practice you'll often find comments in the past tense:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">Fixed WriteLine in helloworld.cs         // good enough
</code></pre>
    <blockquote class="packt_quote"><em class="italic">"In theory, theory and practice are the same; in practice, they never are</em>." -- Pat Johnson</blockquote>
    <p class="normal">It pays to get into the habit of writing good messages in the right format. Your teammates will thank you.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-56" class="title">When the title isn't enough</h2>
    <p class="normal">The message title should be kept to 50 characters. Most of the time this is enough, but if it isn't, leave the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">-m</code> message off and let Git open your editor. There you can add additional <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>information. Skip a line after the header and consider using bullet points or other ways of making the things you want to convey easy to read.</p>
    <p class="normal">Important: By default Git uses vi (a Unix editor). You'll want to enter:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git config ––global core editor "code -w"
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This ensures that Visual Studio Code is your default editor:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_22.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.22: Editing in Visual Studio Code</p>
    <p class="normal">Note that <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">#</code> is the comment character, and all lines that begin with <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">#</code> will be ignored.</p>
    <p class="normal">When you use <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">log </code>(see <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Using the Log</em>) to see your history (or view history in Visual Studio, etc.) you'll see the entire message:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_23.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 2.23: The output of the log command</p>
    <p class="normal">You can see <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>just the headers if you want, using <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">git log -–oneline</code>, but we'll leave the details for <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Using the Log</em>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_02_24.png" alt=""/></figure>
