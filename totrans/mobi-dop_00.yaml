- en: Mobile DevOps is the future of continuous integration and continuous delivery
    for mobile application development, and is a very important requirement of today's
    fast-paced development culture. While DevOps has been implemented and adopted
    by most fast-growing development teams today, mobile DevOps is yet to be used
    by the majority of the mobile development world. It is something that can improve
    integration and delivery, as well as provide a greater feedback mechanism and
    early defect capturing tools.

- en: Mobile DevOps comes with its own implementation challenges, and with various
    mobile platforms out there on millions of devices and with different aspect ratios,
    it is only becoming more important to use tools that streamline testing on physical
    devices and delivery to customers while providing a quick feedback mechanism to
    developers.

- en: In this book, we'll be using Xamarin to explore mobile application development
    fundamentals and tools. Xamarin is a cross-platform mobile application development
    framework from Microsoft that can be used to create iOS, Android, and Windows
    apps using a shareable code base and design. Apart from Xamarin, we'll be using
    other tools from Microsoft's tool belt, such as Xamarin Test Cloud and Visual
    Studios Team Services, to dive deep into the different phases of mobile DevOps.

- en: The main motivation to use Xamarin is its ability to develop cross-platform
    applications and applications with great integration with Microsoft's other widely
    used tools for different phases of the application development cycle.

    and mobile application development, but you should also be able to implement,
    configure, and troubleshoot each and every step involved in the mobile DevOps
    life cycle in your new and/or existing mobile application projects using the popular
    tools that are available.

    basic knowledge of cloud computing and the application development life cycle,
    and also beginner-level knowledge of object-oriented programming languages such
    as Java or C#. The book will go through various phases of the mobile DevOps life
    cycle, which requires a basic understanding of application development fundamentals
    and application delivery. If you have experience with Visual Studio and with programming
    with C#, this is a big plus.
