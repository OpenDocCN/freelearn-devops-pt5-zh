    came **Advanced Roadmaps**, which span multiple projects but are only available
    under a *Premium subscription*. And now, we see the equivalent in JWM projects

    gained traction and has much of the functionality you would expect with this type
    of tool. You can drag starting or ending points of issues to increase their length
    of time, you can add dependencies between issues, and—of course—you can export
    and share your timelines with others.

    dates associated with your issue. JWM projects use the **Start date** field for
    the initiation of work on an issue and the **Due date** field for the end date
    when work should be completed.
  prefs: []

    on the rectangular box associated with the issue at either the beginning (to change
    the start date) or the end of the box (to change the end date) and drag accordingly.
    Be sure to click on one of the slender handles that appear at the end of the box.

    or shorten, as illustrated in the following screenshot:'

    a third-party Marketplace app or adding the **Calendar** gadget to a dashboard.
    Either way, you could not see the calendar from directly inside your project.
    The **Calendar** was one of the first features to be added to JWM and provided
    an immediate lift in functionality not found in other Jira products.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To date, the **Calendar** is still fairly simple, with little flexibility in
    how issues are displayed. But the simple fact that you can access it directly
    in the project makes it super helpful, and we expect the JWM development team
    at Atlassian to continue to produce new functionality. To display the calendar,
    click on the **Calendar** menu option on the left, as illustrated in the following

    is the **Due date** field. The issue will appear on the calendar on the date associated
    with that field. If no filters are applied, you will see all issues in your project
    displayed on the calendar for any issues with a value in the **Due date** field.
    If the **Due date** field is not populated, the issue will not show on the calendar.

    JWM projects and how to access each feature, and we became familiar with how our
    items of work (issues) are related to each feature—their display and relationship.

    such as **Issue type** and **Priority**.
