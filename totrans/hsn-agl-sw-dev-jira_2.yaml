    it, and how to create a project in JIRA. In this chapter, we're going to learn
    about managing all of the work items that we have. Let's go ahead and get started.

    each of these things are, and how we would use and create them in an Agile project.
    Then, we're going to learn about issue type attributes. We're going to talk about
    adding and removing them, and making them really customized to fit the type of
    work that we're doing in JIRA.  Then, we're going to learn about managing the
    items in our backlog, and then we're going to learn about our board (for those
    of us that do Scrum, we are going to feel very comfortable with the board), and
    how to configure it.

- en: '**Epics**, as you might imagine, are large stories. It''s important that they
    have a distinct start and end, just like any story. We want them to be able to
    be completed, which means that they are going to need some sort of end. We like
    to think of epics as something that would span multiple sprints, versus a story,
    which would really be completed within a Sprint. Epics are not groupings of work
    items, and we''ll take a look at that because that''s a common thing that people
    do in a JIRA UX. We''ll take a look at how we use components and labels to do
    this instead of epics. Epics will contain stories, bugs, and tasks, and they''re
    really a grouping of those things, which is again a large story.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stories are smaller than epics. Stories, bugs, and tasks are all the same level
    hierarchically; they're all things that could be prioritized against one another
    within our backlog. Stories are also known as **user stories**, and they're called
    that because the intent is that they will focus on users, we need to think about
    new functionality for whatever this is, and we need to make sure that we're continuing
    to think about the people that we're building it for. That's why they call them
    stories or user stories.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Bugs are what we call defects, and they occur when there's a problem. In JIRA,
    something will always prioritize against a new feature, and we know that we should
    take into account either, *do we want to take the time in this Sprint to fix something,
    or do we want to create something new?* We should be prioritizing those two things
    and pitting them against one another.

    next Sprint, but as the team increases in velocity, to actually pull stories from
    this section into our Sprint so that the team has work as they accelerate. We'll
    look more at that as we get into running a Sprint.

    Sprint. This will eventually be the Sprint that we''ll put on our Sprint board,
    but in the meantime, we have to get our board ready. We can see that what we''ve
    done here is we''ve actually assigned story point values to each of these stories.

    to take a look at this, and a lot of times what we want to do is actually set
    up all of the different team members that are going to be working on stories in
    this Sprint and put them across the top. Then, as we're going through a daily
    Scrum, we can actually click on each name and look at just the items for that
    person and try and figure out if there are any impediments. This is the role of
    the Scrum master as we move through a Scrum Sprint.

    be in TO DO, and then they''ll be DONE, IN PROGRESS. Once they''ve been worked
    on, they need to be tested before they''re considered done, and that way we can
    maintain a high level of quality. We have lots of testers in our Scrum team, and
    this is going to work out just fine because we can actually move a card into that
    testing column and we can have one of the testers help us with testing that. If
    we move into the upper right corner here, we will see three ellipses (…). Let''s
    go into Board settings and take a look at this. We were in here previously, setting

    have the project, we have the query, and we can see that we've actually got multiple
    projects that we can put into a board as well, but we're going to leave these

    free issue types, and then learned what they are and how to add or remove them
    so that we can configure JIRA to meet the needs of our team. Then, we learned
    how to manage the items that are in our backlog, prioritization, assigning the
    edit, assigning to epics and versions, and more. Finally, talked about what a
    board is, how to configure that board so that the workflow matches our workflow,
