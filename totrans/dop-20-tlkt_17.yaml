- en: The custom is to summarize the book at its end. I'll break that tradition by
    not writing a summary. We went through so many practices and tools that summarizing
    them would require quite a big chapter. After all, if, at this point, you need
    a summary of what you learned, it would only mean that you didn't learn as much
    as I hoped. Consequently, I would feel that I failed, get depressed, and never
    write another book.

- en: The book was never meant to be a comprehensive cookbook. I haven't explained
    everything you can do with Docker. Nor I showed you all the power behind Ansible.
    As a matter a fact, I haven't gone into great details with any of the tools. Such
    an approach would require dedication of a single book for each of them. The world
    is full of cookbooks. I wanted to write something different. I wanted to write
    a book that connects the dots between different practices and tools. I wanted
    to show you the logic behind some of the processes we applied. However, since
    I am a very hands-on type of person, my way of learning logic and processes involves
    a lot of practice and a lot of dedication. For that reason, the book is full of
    many hands-on examples. I thought that the best approach is to learn by doing.
    I hope I accomplished my goal. I hope I opened some doors that you might not have
    known existed, or you didn't know how to step through.

    use the Disqus channel *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit* if you'd like to discuss any aspect
    of the book. If you got stuck somewhere, if you failed to grasp something, or
    if you disagree with one of my views (or even all of them), just post it on the
    channel. I created it today while writing the final words. The problem is that
    nobody wants to be the first to post something in an empty place. I encourage
    you to be that first person. Others will benefit from our discussion and join
    in. If, on the other hand, you prefer a more one-on-one conversation, please send
    me an email to `<[viktor@farcic.com](mailto:viktor@farcic.com)>`, contact me through
    HangOuts or Skype (my username is `vfarcic`), or come to Barcelona and invite
    me for a beer.

    until, one day, I gather the courage to start writing a new book. Maybe it will
    be *The DevOps 3.0 Toolkit*. Or, more likely, it will be something entirely different.
    Time will tell.
