<p class="calibre2">In this chapter we are going to learn about versions and releases—what they are and how they're different from each other. We'll talk about how to read burndowns, Sprint reports, and velocity charts to determine whether or not your team is doing well. We will take a look at releasing epic burndowns as well as versions and epic reports, which give us the ability to do forecasting, which is very powerful.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Versions and releases</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Let's start with versions and releases. In this section, we're going to learn about what versions and releases are and how they interact with one another. We're going to talk about how to create and manage these versions, how to assign work to two versions, how to perform a release, and then finally how to view the contents of a release once we've made one.</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">When we talk about versions and releases, versions come from the concept of software. We're all familiar with major and minor versions of a software, for example, Version 2.0 versus Version 2.1. They really represent a large amount of value, so that's a way to think about it: a version represents a chunk of value that's being deployed or released. Versions can be released, so once we've determined what's in a version, and we complete that version, then we can release it, and then that version becomes a release. They're the same thing—just one is pre-deployment and one is post-deployment. Once a version has been released, we can view the contents of that version as release notes, so we'll take a look at that too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's hop over to JIRA and take a look at our Second Project. In the Backlog, we can see that we have VERSIONS. We can actually have a look at these versions by clicking on them:</p>
<div><img src="img/00092.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">As we can see in the preceding screenshot, this is where all our bot versions will be stored. We mentioned before that a version is a release before it's been released; they're the same thing. Let's go under Releases and have a look at the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00093.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can see in the preceding screenshot that we have the version Name, a Start date, the Release date, and a Description. We will make a version and we'll call it <kbd class="calibre12">test version</kbd>. Our Start date and Release date are optional, but let's go ahead and write <kbd class="calibre12">test version</kbd> in the description, as shown in the following screenshot. Then, we'll click  on Add:</p>
<div><img src="img/00094.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">We have the option to look at Released, Unreleased, and Archived versions. We also have our test version. We can create another one if we like. In the following screenshot, we can see that we have the ability  to Release, Archive, and more:</p>
<div><img src="img/00095.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">If we go back to our Backlog, we can see that if we click on the VERSIONS tab on the left, as we can see in the following screenshot, we actually have our test version. We can see the number of Issues, Completed, Unestimated, and more:</p>
<div><img src="img/00096.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can actually take two stories and drag them in. If we do that, we can see in the following screenshot that these stories are now a part of the test version:</p>
<div><img src="img/00097.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">If we go under Releases again, we can take a look at the version. We can see in the following screenshot that there are 2 issues in this version, the two that we added, and there are 0 in Issues Done, 0 in In Progress, and 2 issues in To Do. Once we're done with this, we can actually hit Release and release this item:</p>
<div><img src="img/00098.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">We will go back to the Backlog and we'll put the other three stories into VERSIONS. This means that we now have five issues. We'll go back to Releases and then we'll go ahead and release our version:</p>
<div><img src="img/00099.jpeg" class="calibre76"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">As we can see in the preceding screenshot, we've released the items, we can see the item in progress, and we can see that some are in the to do list. If we go to our Release notes, then we can see what was contained within our version:</p>
<div><img src="img/00100.jpeg" class="calibre77"/></div>
<p>Release notes</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Burndown report</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">We're going to talk about the burndown report. We've spent a little time previously looking at the burndown report in regards to how we use it during running a Sprint iteration, and how we use it with our team. But in this section, we're going to talk more specifically about the report itself and how we read it, and then what kinds of data we can use for a burndown report.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As we already know, burndown is used to measure progress within an iteration and helps us understand whether we are on track or off track from our ideal state. In a burndown, the vertical axis represents the total amount of work that exists inside of that iteration, and the horizontal axis represents time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Burndowns tell stories. The more we look at them, the more we understand what may or may not have happened during an iteration, and we get pretty good at telling the story from looking at those burndowns. In a burndown, we can burn down all kinds of things, so we can burn down points, we can burn down hours, we can burn down risks, and there's other things too.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Burndown example 1</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">We'll now take a look at how to set these things up in JIRA. Let's look at this first example:</p>
<div><img src="img/00101.jpeg" class="calibre78"/></div>
<p>Burndown example 1</p>
<p class="calibre2">First of all, we can see on the vertical axis that we have <strong class="calibre4">STORY POINTS</strong>. In this iteration, we've got about 36 story points at the beginning of this Sprint. We can see at the end that we actually want to burn down two 0 story points, so ideally we're handling all of the work that was committed to in this iteration. On the bottom, we can see that we have <strong class="calibre4">TIME</strong>. As we can see, this would be a two-week Sprint, and we can see that as we go through time, the ideas that we burn down makes the story points go down to zero. The gray line represents the <strong class="calibre4">Ideal</strong> scenario, so, assuming that the work is being sorted through correctly, we want to be close to that gray line, as this would show the pattern that we're looking for. The gray bars in the preceding graph, on the other hand, represent a <strong class="calibre4">Weekend</strong>, or a time that the team is not working, and so we can see that they're flat because ideally we're not working on the weekends. We can also see that there's a blue check box in the upper right-hand side that says <strong class="calibre4">Show Non-Working Days</strong>. We can uncheck that and get rid of those weekends if we don't want to look at them.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Burndown example 2</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">We'll be talking about how burndowns can tell us a story about the Sprint. Let's take a look at the following Burndown example:</p>
<div><img src="img/00102.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Burndown example 2</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">One of the things that we want to keep an eye on, as we can see at the beginning of this particular Sprint, is that we started with 25 story points, and we didn't quite burndown to zero. As we can see in the preceding screenshot, there's a little hump in red, and this hump is caused by work being added to the Sprint once it's already been started. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Burndown report</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Let's take a look at JIRA—we want to have a look at a couple of things. First of all, the way to get to a burndown is to go to Reports. Burndown Chart is the first item that we'll see, and this is where we can get to our burndown:</p>
<div><img src="img/00103.jpeg" class="calibre79"/></div>
<p>All reports</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">The other thing we want to talk a little bit about is burning down other values. If we go back to our Backlog in the upper right corner, we can see that we have our Board settings, so we'll click that, and then under our SETTINGS, we've got Estimation:</p>
<div><img src="img/00104.jpeg" class="calibre80"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">And we can see in the preceding screenshot, we're estimating in story points, but we've also got the ability to estimate in original time as well. Then, we can use this time tracking so that instead of seeing story points on that vertical axis, we'll actually see hours, and so we can burndown hours. As we move through the Sprint items, let's say we've got an item that started with 10 hours, we can then update that value to be, say, 8 hours or 6 hours long, and it will actually burn down the amount of hours as we move through the Sprint.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Sprint report</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to talk about the Sprint report. We'll talk about what it is, and we'll talk about how to read it. In the Sprint report, there's a summary of the Sprint iteration. It's going to show us the burndown, the work that's been completed, the work that wasn't completed, and any work that was added and removed during the iteration.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's take a look at JIRA, and get more information about a Sprint report. Do we remember the demo project that we used? For going into reports, we can click on Reports on the left, and then we can take a look at our Sprint report:</p>
<div><img src="img/00105.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Sprint report</p>
<p class="calibre2">Keep in mind that our burndown is not going to be beautiful because this was a one-day Sprint. Normally, the burndown would be more appropriate based on the iteration length of our we Sprint. But let's pay attention to the bottom. As we can see in the preceding screenshot, we've got the Completed Issues (items that were completed during this Sprint). If we look at any issues that were added after the Sprint started, we'll notice that they have an asterisk by them, which allows us to see any items that came in that were not part of the original commitment. We can also see items that were not completed, so SP-7 was not completed during this Sprint. We can also see any items that were removed from the Sprint. In total, we've got completed items, we've got added items, we've got removed items, and then anything not completed. Of course, we also have a Sprint name and we've got the date range for that Sprint as well.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Velocity chart</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to talk about the velocity chart. The velocity chart is very valuable. First, we'll talk about what it is, how to read it, and then we're going to talk about how to use our past velocity to plan our future commitments.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Velocity chart example</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Let's take a look at an example of a velocity chart:</p>
<div><img src="img/00106.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Velocity chart</p>
<p class="calibre2">To orient us to the preceding chart, let's take a look at the different elements. The gray bars represent what we've committed to in our Sprint, and we can see that this is measured in <strong class="calibre4">Story Points</strong>. In this example, we can see that in <strong class="calibre4">Sprint 3</strong>, we've actually committed to <strong class="calibre4">25</strong> story points. The green bar represents what people created, and so we've completed <strong class="calibre4">25</strong> story points, and we've met <strong class="calibre4">100</strong> percent of our commitment. That's great! We can also see some examples where the gray bar is lower than the green bar, which means we've committed, but we've actually completed even more than we committed, which is even better.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we look at <strong class="calibre4">Sprint 5</strong>, it doesn't have a commitment, so there may have been some sort of data problem there, or there was no commitment and the Sprint was started without a commitment in place, which means we would probably see a burn up when Sprint work was added after the beginning of the iteration. We have already talked about reports telling a story; this report tells a different story, which is interesting. We can see that our velocity is actually dropping, which would definitely be a cause for alarm and it'd be something to talk about with our Scrum master or with the team if we're looking at this report. It's important to get some information about what's going on and use this to gather some knowledge about what's going on with this project. That was the velocity chart. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Release and epic burndowns</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to talk about release and epic burndowns, how important they are, and how we can use them to give us some insight into how things are going. We're going to learn about what release and epic burndowns are, how to read these burndown reports, and how to use these reports for forecasting.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Release burndown example</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">We're going to show an example of a release burndown.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that it releases a version. Essentially, it's a version that's been deployed. An epic is also a container of work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Recall to our backlog. A release is generally larger than an epic, so an epic would be a large story that spans multiple Sprints, but the same concepts apply, and so when we're looking at an epic burndown report, it's going to be the same as a release burndown report, but probably smaller. However it will allow us to project when that epic might be completed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Let's take a look at this release burndown. We want to familiarize it with the different elements of this report:</p>
<div><img src="img/00107.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Release burndown example</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">First of all, what we're seeing in the first column is our estimate of the work that's contained within this version, which will eventually be our release. We can see that it has <strong class="calibre4">184</strong> points. The thing that's interesting about this report, in this specific example, is that we have <strong class="calibre4">28%</strong> of the work that's unestimated, which means that it's hidden. There's <strong class="calibre4">20%</strong> of the issues that are contained within that do not have story point estimates, which means that our original scope is actually larger than the <strong class="calibre4">184</strong>, but we don't have that work sized, which means that that would be very important to go and make sure that all of the work is sized so that it's all contained within our forecast right away. As we said before, those <strong class="calibre4">184</strong> points represent our original scope, and so that medium blue bar represents the original scope of the version at the time of creation. The dark blue in the preceding example, plus <strong class="calibre4">32</strong> points from <strong class="calibre4">Sprint 2</strong>, represents the new scope. This is work that was added in this iteration to this version and is now part of this release. We can see that the green bar represents work that's been completed, so in <strong class="calibre4">Sprint 2</strong>, we finished <strong class="calibre4">46</strong> points of the original scope and added <strong class="calibre4">32</strong> points. We still have <strong class="calibre4">128</strong> points of the original scope remaining. Given this, we can see that we are starting to establish a velocity. We know that this team's velocity is <strong class="calibre4">45</strong> points per Sprint, and, based on that, we can see the dashed line and where we are today. We know that we have <strong class="calibre4">50</strong> story points remaining in the scope of this version. This tells us that we've got just over a Sprint worth of work, so essentially two Sprints remains. If our two Sprints are two weeks each, then we can see that we have essentially one month remaining before this version will be available for release, and that gives us the ability to forecast. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Version and epic reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section about reporting, we're going to talk about version and epic reports. In the previous section, we talked about release and epic burndowns, and we're going to get a similar kind of view in this report, but it's a different look, with slightly different information. In this section, we're going to learn about what version and epic reports are. Again, they're very similar.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A version report is large and contains a larger piece of value and an epic is small. It is basically the same kind of report, but it allows us to look at a specific version or a specific epic, and then we get some sort of forecast as to when that item will be completed. We'll look at how to read a version report, and then we'll also look at how we can use these reports to provide a forecast.</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Version report example</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">We're going to look at an example version report, as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/00108.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Version report</p>
<p class="calibre2">As we can see in the preceding figure, we've got the work in the vertical axis represented in <strong class="calibre4">STORY POINTS</strong>. We can see that there's actually quite a few story points in the preceding report, because usually a version has a lot of functionality built into it. We can also see that the horizontal axis represents <strong class="calibre4">TIME</strong>. There's a red line in the report which represents the amount of unestimated work as it goes up and down, as we move through this version. We can see from the blue line that this version started in January, we can see <strong class="calibre4">Today</strong>, which is represented by a dotted line, and we can see that we have a projected completion date. Some other things to note is the completed date is a cone shape, and that there's an optimistic date a little bit to the left of that projected completion date, and a little bit to the right of that is a pessimistic date.</p>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2"/>
<p class="calibre2">We actually have an optimistic and pessimistic release date and projected based on the actual velocity of the team and the work that's included inside of that version. This value is actually dynamically generated as we move through time. If we remove the scope from this version, this will pull the date in and it will actually deliver earlier, and if the team slows down or if we add more scope, then that date will get pushed out. The closer we get to the actual release date (the projected completion date), the tighter that cone gets until there's no more cone left at all. When we first started in February or March, we'd have a much broader wider cone, given the fact that there's a lot of variables that could affect that completed date. This gives us a useful ability to look at this version over time, and figure out what that completion date might look like, and do some things very far ahead that would allow us to affect that. Should we bring the team together into one room, should we add more people, more to resources to the project, should we change the scope, and so on, we've got lots of choices assuming we've got a good view of what's coming and what lies ahead.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">That brings us to the end of this chapter. In this chapter, we learned about what versions and releases are, what iteration release epic burndown reports have and how we should read them, what a Sprint report is, the data that's inside a Sprint report and how we can read it, what a velocity report looks like and why it's important for planning future Sprints, what version and epic reports are and how to read them, and then we also talked about version and epic reports and used those to provide forecasts for when our version will be completed. </p>
