    Software for Kanban*, Jira comes with a number of reports that you can generate
    to get a better understanding of how your project is tracking. However, they often
    require you to go to your board and then generate the report manually. A better
    way to display and share information on your project is to take advantage of some
    of Jira's built-in collaboration features.

    retrospective sprint reports at the end of each sprint. Remember, one of the key
    ideas behind agile is continuous improvement, so it is important that at the end
    of each sprint, the entire team comes together and discusses what the they did
    well, and what went wrong during the sprint; and also to summarize lessons learned
    and discuss how to improve the process in the next sprint as a team.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we looked at some of the additional features and capabilities
    Jira offers, so you can now create your Scrum and Kanban boards just the way you
    want them. We looked at using some of the non-agile specific features of Jira,
    such as gadgets and dashboards to better surface data and help with collaboration.
    We looked at integrating Jira with Confluence and Team Calendars, so you can create
    detailed documentations and report and cross-reference them with epics, user stories,
    and sprints.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Remember, a bit part of these features is to take the data out of Jira so it
    is not in a silo, and share the information with the team and other stakeholders
    of your projects. By sharing information on a dashboard, and retrospectively reviewing
    your progress as a team, you can contiguously refine and improve together, and
    become successful at using agile and being agile.

    another solution from Atlassian that focuses on helping software engineers manage,
    build, and deploy code. Together with Jira, this will complete the cycle of using
    Jira Software as an agile project management solution for software development.
