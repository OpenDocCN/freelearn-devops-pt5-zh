			<h1 id="_idParaDest-255"><a id="_idTextAnchor257"/>Securing Jira</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapters, you learned how to store data in Jira by creating issues. As you can see, as an information system, Jira is all about data. It should come as no surprise to you that security plays a big role in Jira, to ensure that only the right people will get access to your data. This is achieved by providing a flexible and robust way for you to manage access control. It is able to integrate with your existing security practices, such as a password policy, and allows both centrally controlled permissions and delegating and empowering your project owners and users to manage permissions for their own projects.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have learned about the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Managing users, groups, and project roles</li>
				<li>User <a id="_idIndexMarker694"/>directories and how to connect Jira to the <strong class="bold">Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</strong> (<strong class="bold">LDAP</strong>)</li>
				<li>General access control in Jira</li>
				<li>Managing project- and issue-level permission settings</li>
				<li>How to troubleshoot permission problems</li>
				<li>Configuring <a id="_idIndexMarker695"/>Jira <a id="_idIndexMarker696"/>with <strong class="bold">Security Assertion Markup Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAML</strong>) <strong class="bold">single sign-on</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSO</strong>) and <strong class="bold">just-in-time</strong> (<strong class="bold">JIT</strong>) user <a id="_idIndexMarker697"/>provision</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Specifically, we will look at the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Managing users</li>
				<li>Managing groups and roles</li>
				<li>User directories</li>
				<li>Understanding Jira permissions</li>
				<li>Issue security</li>
				<li>Troubleshooting permissions</li>
				<li>Workflow security</li>
				<li>Password policy</li>
				<li>Enabling SSO with SAML</li>
				<li>Auditing system changes</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">human resources</strong> (<strong class="bold">HR</strong>) project</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Before we delve into the deep end of how Jira handles security, let’s first take a look at how Jira maintains user and group memberships.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-256"><a id="_idTextAnchor258"/>Managing users</h1>
			<p>Each user <a id="_idIndexMarker698"/>needs to have an account for them to access Jira unless it is configured to allow anonymous access (refer to the <em class="italic">Permission schemes</em> section in this chapter for details). Each user is identified by their unique username.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">user browser</strong> is where <a id="_idIndexMarker699"/>you will be able to see a list of all the users in Jira, including their usernames, email addresses, last login attempt, and which user directory they belong to. The user browser also provides you with search capabilities. You will be able to search for users that fit the criteria, such as by username, full name, email address, and group association. Perform the following steps to access <a id="_idIndexMarker700"/>the user browser:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">User management</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Users</strong> option, to take you to a screen like this:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.1_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1 – User browser&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.1 – User browser</p>
			<p>By default, the results will be paginated to show 20 users per page, but you can change this setting <a id="_idIndexMarker701"/>to show up to 100 users per page. When dealing with large deployments having hundreds of users, these options will become very useful to quickly find the users you need to manage.</p>
			<p>Other than providing the ability for you to effectively search for users, the user browser also lets you add new users to Jira and manage a user’s group/role associations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-257"><a id="_idTextAnchor259"/>Adding a user</h2>
			<p>Jira lets <a id="_idIndexMarker702"/>you add new users in several ways, such as the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Direct creation by the Jira administrator</li>
				<li>Invitation from the Jira administrator to create an account</li>
				<li>Synchronization of user accounts from an external user repository, such as LDAP</li>
				<li>By signing up for an account if the public signup option is enabled</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The first three options have centralized management, whereby only Jira administrators can create and/or manage user accounts. These options are most applicable to private Jira instances designed to be used by an organization’s internal users.</p>
			<p>The last option allows users to sign up for accounts by themselves. This is most useful when you run a public Jira instance, where manually creating user accounts is not scalable enough to handle the volume. We will be looking at how to enable the public signup option and integrate with LDAP in the <em class="italic">User directories</em> section later. For now, we will <a id="_idIndexMarker703"/>examine how administrators can create user accounts manually. Here’s how to do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">User Browser</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create user</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Enter a unique username for the new user. Jira will let you know if the username is already taken.</li>
				<li>Enter the password, full name, and email address of the user. If you do not enter a password, a random password will be generated. In this case, you should select the <strong class="bold">Send notification email</strong> option so that the new user can reset their password.</li>
				<li>Select which applications in Jira the new user will have access to. For example, if you are running Jira software, you should check the <strong class="bold">Jira Software</strong> option. Doing so will consume one license seat count.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create user</strong> button to create a new user.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Alternatively, administrators can also choose to invite users so that they can create their accounts themselves. This is different than the public signup option since only recipients of invitations will be able to create accounts. For this feature to work, you will need to have an outgoing mail server configured, as invitations will be sent as emails. Perform the following steps to invite users to sign up:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">User Browser</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Invite users</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Specify the email addresses of the people you wish to invite. You can invite multiple people at once.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Invite users</strong> button to send out invitations.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-258"><a id="_idTextAnchor260"/>Enabling public signup</h2>
			<p>If your Jira setup is public (for example, an open source project), then creating user accounts <a id="_idIndexMarker704"/>individually, as explained earlier, would become a very demanding job for your administrator. For this type of Jira setup, you can enable public signup to allow users to create accounts by themselves. Perform the following steps to enable public signup in Jira:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">General configuration</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit Settings</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Public</strong> for the <strong class="bold">Mode</strong> field.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Update</strong> button to apply the change.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you have set Jira to run in <strong class="bold">Public</strong> mode, users will be able to sign up and create their own accounts from the login page, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.2_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2 – Public signup&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2 – Public signup</p>
			<p>As you will see in the <em class="italic">Application access</em> section later in this chapter, once a user signs up for a new account, they will automatically join groups with the Jira user’s global permission. If you have set Jira to run in <strong class="bold">Private</strong> mode, then only the administrator will be able to create new accounts.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-259"><a id="_idTextAnchor261"/>Enabling CAPTCHA</h2>
			<p>If you are running Jira in <strong class="bold">Public</strong> mode, you run the risk of having automated spam bots creating <a id="_idIndexMarker705"/>user accounts on your system. To counter this, Jira provides <a id="_idIndexMarker706"/>the <strong class="bold">CAPTCHA</strong> service, where potential users will be required to type a word represented in an image into a text field. Perform the following steps to enable the CAPTCHA service:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">General configuration</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit Settings</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">On</strong> for the <strong class="bold">CAPTCHA on signup</strong> field.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Update</strong> button to apply the change.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now, when someone tries to sign up for an account, Jira will present them with a CAPTCHA challenge that must be verified before the account is created, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.3_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.3 – CAPTCHA&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.3 – CAPTCHA</p>
			<p>In addition to managing users, we also need to review how groups and roles are managed in Jira. Let’s go through this in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-260"><a id="_idTextAnchor262"/>Managing groups and roles</h1>
			<p>Groups are a common way of managing users in any information system. A group represents <a id="_idIndexMarker707"/>a collection of users, usually based on their positions and <a id="_idIndexMarker708"/>responsibilities within the organization. In Jira, groups provide an effective way to apply configuration settings, such as permissions and notifications, to users.</p>
			<p>Groups are global in Jira, which is something that should not be confused with project roles (which we will discuss later). This means that if you belong to the <code>jira-administrators</code> group, then you will always be in that group regardless of which project you are accessing. You will see in later sections how this is different from project roles.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-261"><a id="_idTextAnchor263"/>Managing groups</h2>
			<p>As with the user browser, the group browser allows you to search, add, and configure groups within Jira. Here’s how to access this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">User management</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Groups</strong> option. This will bring up the <strong class="bold">Group Browser</strong> page, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.4_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.4 – Group Browser page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.4 – Group Browser page</p>
			<p>Jira comes <a id="_idIndexMarker709"/>with a few default groups. These groups are created automatically when you install Jira. For Jira software, we have the following groups:</p>
			<table id="table001-6" class="T---Table">
				<colgroup>
					<col/>
					<col/>
				</colgroup>
				<tbody>
					<tr class="T---Table">
						<td class="T---Table T---Body T---Body">
							<p><strong class="bold">Group</strong></p>
						</td>
						<td class="T---Table T---Body T---Body">
							<p><strong class="bold">Description</strong></p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="T---Table">
						<td class="T---Table T---Body T---Body">
							<p><code>jira-administrators</code></p>
						</td>
						<td class="T---Table T---Body T---Body">
							<p>Administrators of Jira. By default, this group lets you access the administration console.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
					<tr class="T---Table">
						<td class="T---Table T---Body T---Body">
							<p><code>jira-software-users</code></p>
						</td>
						<td class="T---Table T---Body T---Body">
							<p>By default, members of this group will have access to the Jira Software application.</p>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 9.1 – Default groups</p>
			<p>Other Jira applications, such as Jira Service Desk, will have different sets of default groups.</p>
			<h3>Adding a group</h3>
			<p>Other than <a id="_idIndexMarker710"/>the three groups that come by default with Jira, you can create your own groups. It is important to note that once you create a group, you cannot change its name. Therefore, make sure that you think about the name of the group carefully before you create it. Follow these steps to create a group:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Group Browser</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Enter a unique name for the new group in the <strong class="bold">Add group</strong> section.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add group</strong> button to create this new group.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After a <a id="_idIndexMarker711"/>group is created, it will be empty and will have no members; you will need to manually add users to the group.</p>
			<h3>Editing group memberships</h3>
			<p>Often, people move around within an organization, and your Jira setup needs to be kept up to date <a id="_idIndexMarker712"/>with such movement. In the group browser, there are two ways to manage group memberships. The first option is to manage the membership on a per-group level, and the second option is to manage several groups at the same time. These options are actually similar, so we will cover them at the same time.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to manage individual groups:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Group Browser</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit members</strong> link for the group you wish to manage members of. This will bring you to the <strong class="bold">Bulk Edit Group Members</strong> page.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You will notice that both options will take you to the same page. The difference is that if you chose the individual group option, Jira will auto-select the group to update, and if you chose the bulk edit option, then no groups will be selected. However, regardless of which option you choose, you can still select one or all of the groups to apply your changes to, as described in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.5_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.5 – Group members&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.5 – Group members</p>
			<p>Perform <a id="_idIndexMarker713"/>the following steps to update the membership in one or more groups:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Bulk Edit Group Members</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Select one or more groups to update.</li>
				<li>Select users from the middle box and click on the <strong class="bold">Remove selected users</strong> button to take users out of the groups.</li>
				<li>Specify users (by typing usernames) in the right-hand side box and click on the <strong class="bold">Add selected users</strong> button to add users to the groups.</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>Deleting a group</h3>
			<p>If a group <a id="_idIndexMarker714"/>has become redundant, you can remove it from Jira by following these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Group Browser</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> link for the group you wish to remove and click on <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> again to permanently remove the group.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you remove a group, all users who previously belonged to it will have their group associations updated to reflect the change. However, if you have other configurations using the group, it can have a negative impact if you are not careful. For example, if you are restricting the <code>developers</code> in your permission scheme, by deleting the <code>developers</code> group, nobody will <a id="_idIndexMarker715"/>be able to create issues in projects using the permission scheme.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Be very careful when deleting a group, as it might be used in other configurations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-262"><a id="_idTextAnchor264"/>Managing roles</h2>
			<p>As you have seen, groups are collections of users and are applied globally to all projects in Jira. Jira also <a id="_idIndexMarker716"/>offers another way of grouping users, which is applied on the project level only.</p>
			<p>Similar to users and groups, project roles are maintained by the Jira administrator through the <strong class="bold">Project Role Browser</strong> page. There is a slight difference, however, because <a id="_idIndexMarker717"/>since project roles are specific to projects, Jira administrators only define which roles are available in Jira and their default members. Each project’s administrators (discussed in later sections) can further define each role’s membership for their own projects, overriding the default assignment. We will first look at what Jira administrators can control through the <strong class="bold">Project Role Browser</strong> page and then look at how project administrators can fine-tune the membership assignment later.</p>
			<p>Perform the <a id="_idIndexMarker718"/>following steps to access the <strong class="bold">Project Role Browser</strong> page:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Project roles</strong> option. This will bring up the <strong class="bold">Project Role Browser</strong> page, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.6_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.6 – Project Role Browser page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.6 – Project Role Browser page</p>
			<h3>Adding a project role</h3>
			<p>To start <a id="_idIndexMarker719"/>creating your own project roles, you will first need to add the role as a Jira administrator, and then each project administrator will be able to add users to it. Perform the following steps to create a new project role:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Project Role Browser</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Enter a unique name for the new project role in the <strong class="bold">Add Project Role</strong> section.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Project Role</strong> button to create this project role.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you add a new project role, it will appear for every project.</p>
			<h3>Managing default members</h3>
			<p>You can assign default members to project roles so that newly created projects will have project <a id="_idIndexMarker720"/>roles assigned to them. Default members are an efficient way for Jira administrators to assign project role members automatically, without having to manually manage each new project as it comes in.</p>
			<p>For example, by default, users in the <code>jira-administrators</code> group will have the <strong class="bold">Administrators</strong> project role. This not only increases the efficiency of the setup by creating a baseline for new projects but also offers the flexibility to allow modifications to the default setup to cater to unique requirements.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to set default members for a project role:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Project Role Browser</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Manage Default Members</strong> link for the project role you wish to edit.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows that the <code>jira-software-users</code>):</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.7_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.7 – Default role members&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.7 – Default role members</p>
			<p>On this page, you will see all the default members assigned to the selected project role. You can <a id="_idIndexMarker721"/>assign default memberships based on individual users or groups.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to add a default user/group to a project role:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> link for the default member option (either the user or group).</li>
				<li>Use the user picker/group picker function to select users/groups you wish to assign to the project role.</li>
				<li>Click on the <code>jira-software-users</code> group is the default group for the <code>contract-developers</code> group is to be added:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.8_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.8 – Adding a default role member&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.8 – Adding a default role member</p>
			<p>Once added, any new <a id="_idIndexMarker722"/>projects created will have the specified users/groups assigned to the project role. It is important to note that changes to default memberships are only applied to new projects. Existing projects will not retrospectively have the new default members applied.</p>
			<h3>Assigning project role members</h3>
			<p>As you have seen, Jira allows you to assign default members to projects when they are created. This might be sufficient for most projects when they start, but changes will often need <a id="_idIndexMarker723"/>to be made due to staff movement during the project life cycle. While it is possible for the Jira administrator to continue maintaining each project’s membership, it can easily become an overwhelming task, and in most cases, since project roles are specific to each project, it makes sense to delegate this responsibility to the owner of each project.</p>
			<p>In Jira, an owner of a project is someone with the <strong class="bold">Administer Projects</strong> permission. By default, members of the <strong class="bold">Administrators</strong> project role will have this permission. We will see how to manage permissions in Jira in the <em class="italic">Project permissions</em> section later.</p>
			<p>As a project administrator, you will be able to assign members to various project roles for your project. You can assign roles from the project administration page, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project administration page for the project you want to update.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Users and roles</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add users to a role</strong> link.</li>
				<li>Start typing the user’s username or the group’s name. Jira will auto-search for results as you type.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add users to a role</strong> button once you have found the user/group you want to add. You can see an overview of this in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.9_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.9 – Adding a role member&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.9 – Adding a role member</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">You should use groups instead of individual users where possible to help with future maintenance.</p>
			<p>The users <a id="_idIndexMarker724"/>and groups assigned to a project role will be for the current project only. Each project administrator can configure this for their own projects. In this way, you can maintain project role memberships separately for each project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-263"><a id="_idTextAnchor265"/>User directories</h1>
			<p>You might <a id="_idIndexMarker725"/>be wondering how and where Jira stores users and groups. User directories are what Jira uses to do this. A user directory is backed by a user repository system, such as LDAP, a database, or a remote user management system, such as Atlassian Crowd. Out of the box, Jira comes with a default internal directory that stores user and group information in the database.</p>
			<p>You can have multiple user directories in Jira. This allows you to connect your Jira instance to multiple user repositories. For example, you can have an LDAP directory for your internal users and the Jira internal directory using the database for external users. An example <a id="_idIndexMarker726"/>is given in the following screenshot, where we have three user directories configured. The first user directory is the built-in Jira internal directory running on the Jira database. The second user directory is connected to Microsoft <strong class="bold">Active Directory</strong> (<strong class="bold">AD</strong>) in read-only <a id="_idIndexMarker727"/>mode. The last user directory is connected to Atlassian Crowd, user identity management software from Atlassian:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.10_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.10 – User directories&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.10 – User directories</p>
			<p>As a Jira administrator, you can manage user directories by performing these two steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">User management</strong> tab and then select the <strong class="bold">User Directories</strong> option.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>From there, you can see a list of user directories you currently have configured in Jira, add new directories, and manually synchronize with the remote user repository.</p>
			<p>When adding <a id="_idIndexMarker728"/>a new user directory, you need to first decide on the directory type. There are several different user directory types within Jira, as outlined here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Jira internal directory</strong>: This is the built-in default user directory when you first <a id="_idIndexMarker729"/>install Jira. With this directory, all the user and group information is stored in the Jira database.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">AD/LDAP</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker730"/>is used when you want to connect Jira to an LDAP server. With this directory, Jira will use the backend LDAP to query user information and group membership. This is also known as an LDAP connector and should not be confused with internal and LDAP authentication directories.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Internal with LDAP authentication</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker731"/>is also known <a id="_idIndexMarker732"/>as a delegated LDAP. With this directory type, Jira will only use LDAP for authentication and will keep all user information internally in the database (retrieved from LDAP when the user successfully authenticates for the first time). This approach can provide better performance. Since LDAP is only used for authentication, this avoids the need to download larger numbers of groups from LDAP.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Atlassian Crowd</strong>: If you are also using Atlassian Crowd, a user management and SSO <a id="_idIndexMarker733"/>and identity management solution, you can use this directory type to connect to your crowd instance. With this option, you can also configure your Jira instance to participate in the SSO session. Note that Jira Data Center has SSO support built in, so Atlassian Crowd is not required.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Atlassian Jira</strong>: Jira <a id="_idIndexMarker734"/>can act as a user repository for other compatible applications. If you have another Jira instance running, you can use this directory type to connect to the other Jira instance and for user information.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you have multiple user directories configured for Jira, there are a few important points to keep in mind. The order of the user directories is important, as it will directly affect the order Jira will use to search for users and apply changes to users and groups. For example, if you have two user directories and both have a user called <code>admin</code> with different passwords, this will have the following effects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When you log in to Jira with the <code>admin</code> username, you will be logged in as the <code>admin</code> user from the first user directory that is able to validate the password, in the order of listed directories.</li>
				<li>After logging in, you will be granted group membership from the directory that has validated your password. Any other directories will be skipped.</li>
				<li>If you make a change to the <code>admin</code> user, such as changing the full name, then the changes will only be applied to the first directory Jira has write access to.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Another important <a id="_idIndexMarker735"/>point to remember when working with user directories is that you cannot make changes to the user directory when you are logged in with a user account that belongs to the said directory. For example, if you are logged in with an LDAP account, then you will not be able to make changes to Jira’s LDAP user directory settings, since there is the potential for the new change to actually lock you out of Jira.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Always have an active administrator user account ready in the default Jira internal directory—for example, the account created during the initial setup. This will provide you with an administrator account that can help you fix user directory problems, such as the preceding scenario. If you have a user account with the same name in the other user directory, then the internal directory should also be the first one in the list.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-264"><a id="_idTextAnchor266"/>Connecting to LDAP</h2>
			<p>Jira supports <a id="_idIndexMarker736"/>a wide range of LDAP servers, including Microsoft AD and OpenLDAP. If a particular LDAP is not listed as one of the options, then we also have a <strong class="bold">Generic Directory Server</strong> option.</p>
			<p>When using the AD/LDAP connector directory type, you can choose to connect with one of the following permission options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Read only</strong>: Jira cannot make any modifications to the LDAP server.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Read only, with local groups</strong>: Information retrieved from LDAP will be read-only, but you can also add users to groups created within Jira. These changes will not be reflected in LDAP.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Read/Write</strong>: Jira will be able to retrieve and make changes to the LDAP server.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Read only</strong> option is <a id="_idIndexMarker737"/>the most common option, as <strong class="bold">information technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>) teams often centrally manage LDAP servers and changes are not allowed. With this option, Jira will only need read access to user data stored in LDAP to verify user credentials <a id="_idIndexMarker738"/>and group membership. If you only want to use LDAP as a user repository and for authentication, but still want to have the flexibility to update group membership without having to get the LDAP team involved, then the <strong class="bold">Read only, with local groups</strong> option will be the best fit. Lastly, the <strong class="bold">Read/Write</strong> option should be avoided, as propagating changes to LDAP, such as group membership, can have an unforeseen impact on other systems also relying on the same LDAP server.</p>
			<p>To connect your Jira setup to LDAP, all you have to do is add a new user directory, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">User Directories</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Directory</strong> button and select either <strong class="bold">Microsoft Active Directory</strong> or <strong class="bold">LDAP</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Directory Type</strong> select list, and then click on <strong class="bold">Next</strong>.</li>
				<li>Provide your LDAP server information.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Since every <a id="_idIndexMarker739"/>LDAP is different, the exact parameters that are required will vary. At a minimum, you need to provide the following information:</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-265"><a id="_idTextAnchor267"/>Understanding Jira permissions</h1>
			<p>Jira manages <a id="_idIndexMarker743"/>its permissions in a hierarchical manner. Each level is more fine-grained than the one above it. For a user to gain access to a resource (for example, to view an issue), they need to satisfy all applicable permissions, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application access</strong>: This defines the groups that will have access to the various applications in Jira (for example, Jira Software)</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Global permission</strong>: This permission controls access rights functions, such as overall administration</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project-level permission</strong>: This permission controls project-level permissions—for example, creating and editing issues</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue-level security</strong>: This permission controls view access to each individual issue</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will now look at each of the permission levels and how you can configure them to suit your requirements, starting from access to the Jira application.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-266"><a id="_idTextAnchor268"/>Application access</h2>
			<p>As we have explained in <a href="B18644_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Jira Data Center</em>, the Jira product family includes <a id="_idIndexMarker744"/>several applications and you can have them all running together—for example, you can have Jira Software and Jira Service Management running in the same instance. Access to each of the running applications is controlled via the <strong class="bold">Application access</strong> feature. To manage application access, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Applications</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Application access</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Select a group to grant access to the application. If you check the <strong class="bold">Default </strong>option of the group, new users will be added to the group when created. You can see an overview of this in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.13_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.13 – Application access&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.13 – Application access</p>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker745"/>only assign groups with application access. Once a group is assigned access to an application, all active users in the group will be granted access. Note that each user in the group will also consume a license seat for the application.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-267"><a id="_idTextAnchor269"/>Global permissions</h2>
			<p>Global permissions, as the <a id="_idIndexMarker746"/>name suggests, control permissions <a id="_idIndexMarker747"/>that are applied globally, such as administrator-level access. Similar to application access, global permissions are applied to groups rather than individual users. The following table lists all permissions and what they control in Jira:</p>

			<h3>Jira System Administrators versus Jira Administrators</h3>
			<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker748"/>people <a id="_idIndexMarker749"/>who are new to Jira, it is <a id="_idIndexMarker750"/>often confusing when it comes to distinguishing between the <strong class="bold">Jira System Administrators</strong> and <strong class="bold">Jira Administrators</strong> global permission. For the most part, they are very similar, and they can carry out most of the administrative functions in Jira.</p>
			<p>The difference is that Jira administrators cannot access functions that can affect the application environment or network, while a Jira system administrator has access to everything.</p>
			<p>While <a id="_idIndexMarker751"/>it can <a id="_idIndexMarker752"/>be useful to separate these <a id="_idIndexMarker753"/>two, in most cases, it is not necessary. By default, the <code>jira-administrators</code> group has both <strong class="bold">Jira System Administrators</strong> and <strong class="bold">Jira Administrators</strong> permissions.</p>
			<p>The following list shows examples of system operations that are only available to people with the <strong class="bold">Jira System Administrators</strong> permission:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Configuring SMTP server details</li>
				<li>Configuring <a id="_idIndexMarker754"/>the <strong class="bold">Concurrent Versions System</strong> (<strong class="bold">CVS</strong>) source code repository</li>
				<li>Configuring listeners</li>
				<li>Configuring services</li>
				<li>Configuring where Jira stores index files</li>
				<li>Importing <a id="_idIndexMarker755"/>data into Jira from an <strong class="bold">Extensible Markup Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">XML</strong>) backup</li>
				<li>Exporting data from Jira to an XML backup</li>
				<li>Configuring attachment settings</li>
				<li>Accessing Jira license details</li>
				<li>Granting/revoking <strong class="bold">Jira System Administrators</strong> global permission</li>
				<li>Deleting users with <strong class="bold">Jira System Administrators</strong> global permission</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Configuring global permissions</h3>
			<p>Global permissions <a id="_idIndexMarker756"/>are configured and maintained by Jira administrators and Jira system administrators, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Global permissions</strong> option to bring up the <strong class="bold">Global Permissions</strong> page, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.14_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.14 – Global Permissions page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.14 – Global Permissions page</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">Users with the <strong class="bold">Jira Administrators</strong> global permission cannot grant themselves the <strong class="bold">Jira System Administrators</strong> global permission.</p>
			<h3>Granting global permissions</h3>
			<p>Global permissions can only be granted to groups. For this reason, you will need to organize <a id="_idIndexMarker757"/>your users into logical groups for global permissions to take effect. For example, you will want to have all your administrators belong to a single group, such as the <code>jira-administrators</code> group so that you can grant them administration permission. Here’s how to do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Global Permissions</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Select a permission you wish to assign from the <strong class="bold">Add Permission</strong> section.</li>
				<li>Choose the group to be given the permission.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to add the assignment.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Group</strong> drop-down list will list all the groups in Jira. It will also have an extra option called <strong class="bold">Anyone on the web</strong>. This option refers to all users, including those that are not needed to log in to access Jira. You cannot select this option when granting the <strong class="bold">Jira Users</strong> permission, as they are required to log in, and <strong class="bold">Anyone</strong> refers to a non-logged-in user. For a <a id="_idIndexMarker758"/>production system, it is recommended to take care when granting any global permission to <strong class="bold">Anyone</strong> (non-logged-in users), as this can lead to security and privacy concerns. For example, by granting <strong class="bold">Anyone</strong> as the global permission for <strong class="bold">Browse Users</strong>, anyone with access to your Jira instance will be able to get your registered users’ information.</p>
			<h3>Revoking global permissions</h3>
			<p>Global permissions can also be revoked. Both Jira system administrators and Jira administrators <a id="_idIndexMarker759"/>can revoke global permissions, but Jira administrators cannot revoke the <strong class="bold">Jira System Administrators</strong> global permission.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to delete a global permission from a group:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Global Permissions</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> link for the group you wish to remove from the global permission.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button to revoke the global permission for the group.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Jira has built-in validation rules to prevent you from accidentally locking yourself out by mistakenly removing the wrong permissions. For example, Jira will not let you delete the last group from <strong class="bold">Jira System Administrators</strong> global permissions, as doing so effectively prevent you from adding yourself back (since only Jira system administrators can assign/revoke global permissions).</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-268"><a id="_idTextAnchor270"/>Project permissions</h1>
			<p>The next level of permission control is project permissions. Jira defines a list of permissions <a id="_idIndexMarker760"/>that covers the different operations a user can perform within the context of a project, such as creating new issues and adding comments to issues. Unlike application access and global permissions, which only allow you to use groups, project permissions have a lot more options when it comes to determining <a id="_idIndexMarker761"/>who to grant permissions to. A list of project permissions is set out here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Application access</strong>: This is for any user that has been granted access to the application</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong>: This is the user who submitted the issue</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Group</strong>: These are all users that belong to the specified group</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Single user</strong>: This is any user in Jira</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project lead</strong>: This is the lead of the project</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Current assignee</strong>: This is the user currently assigned to the issue</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project role</strong>: These are all users that belong to the specified role</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">User custom field value</strong>: This user is specified in a custom field of the type <strong class="bold">User Custom Field</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Group custom field value</strong>: These are users within a specified group in a <strong class="bold">Group Custom Field</strong> type</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Since you will likely have many projects, Jira lets you define your permissions once and apply them to multiple projects, with permission schemes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-269"><a id="_idTextAnchor271"/>Permission schemes</h2>
			<p>Permission <a id="_idIndexMarker762"/>schemes are collections of associations <a id="_idIndexMarker763"/>between permissions and users. Each permission scheme is a reusable, self-contained entity that can be applied to one or more projects.</p>
			<p>As with most schemes, permission schemes are applied on the project level. This allows you to apply fine-grained permissions for each project. Just as with project roles, Jira administrators oversee the creation and configuration of permission schemes, and it is up to each project’s administrator to choose and decide which permission scheme to use. This way, administrators are encouraged to design their permissions so that they can be reused based on the common needs of their organization. With meaningful scheme names and descriptions, project administrators will be able to choose a scheme that will fit their needs the best instead of requesting a new set of permissions to be set up for each project.</p>
			<p>There is, however, some level of freedom for project administrators when it comes to configuration <a id="_idIndexMarker764"/>workflows and screens used by <a id="_idIndexMarker765"/>their own projects, as we have already seen in earlier chapters covering those two topics. If the permission scheme has the <strong class="bold">Extended project administration</strong> option enabled, then any projects using that permission scheme will allow project administrators to make changes without having to rely on a Jira administrator.</p>
			<p>We will first look at how Jira administrators manage and configure permission schemes and then at how project administrators can apply them in their projects.</p>
			<p>Perform the <a id="_idIndexMarker766"/>following steps to start managing permission schemes:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Permission schemes</strong> option to bring up the <strong class="bold">Permission schemes</strong> page, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.15_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.15 – Permission schemes page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.15 – Permission schemes page</p>
			<p>On the <strong class="bold">Permission schemes</strong> page, you will see a list of all the permission schemes. From there, you <a id="_idIndexMarker767"/>will be able to create new schemes and edit and delete <a id="_idIndexMarker768"/>existing schemes, as well as configure each scheme’s permission settings.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-270"><a id="_idTextAnchor272"/>Configuring permission schemes</h2>
			<p>Unlike <a id="_idIndexMarker769"/>other schemes, such as workflow schemes, Jira does not create a project-specific permission <a id="_idIndexMarker770"/>scheme when you create a new project, but rather, it uses a preconfigured scheme called the <strong class="bold">Default Permission Scheme</strong>. If your <a id="_idIndexMarker771"/>project needs to have its permission configuration changed, you can either update the permissions in the Default Permission Scheme (which would apply the changes to all other projects using it) or create a separate permission scheme for your new project.</p>
			<p>Since there are many permissions in a permission scheme, it is often much easier and more efficient to clone the Default Permission Scheme or another existing permission scheme as the base for your new permission scheme and then make the necessary changes, instead of creating a new scheme from scratch.</p>
			<p>Once you have decided to either update an existing permission scheme or have created a new permission scheme, you can then proceed to update its permission settings, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Permission Schemes</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> link for a permissions scheme you wish to configure.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>On this page, you will be presented with a list of project-level permissions, along with short descriptions for each, and the users, groups, and roles that are linked to each of the permissions. This is your one-page view of permission settings for projects, and you will also be <a id="_idIndexMarker772"/>able to control who will have access to each of the actions defined by the permissions listed. You can see an overview of this page in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.16_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.16 – Configuring a permission scheme&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.16 – Configuring a permission scheme</p>
			<p>To grant permissions to one or more users, do the following:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Grant permission</strong> button or the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> link for a specific permission.</li>
				<li>Select permissions you wish to grant to the user.</li>
				<li>Select who to grant the permission to. Click on the <strong class="bold">Show more</strong> link to see more options.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Grant</strong> button to grant the selected permission, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.17_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.17 – Grant permission page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.17 – Grant permission page</p>
			<p>As you can see, unlike global permissions, which only allow you to grant permissions to groups, there are many options available. While each option has its uses, you need to consider <a id="_idIndexMarker773"/>how you can maintain your permissions in the long run. For example, although it might be tempting to use the <strong class="bold">Single user</strong> option to quickly grant permission to a user who is requesting access quickly, this can easily become a maintenance nightmare if not careful. The most common options are <strong class="bold">Group</strong> and <strong class="bold">Project Role</strong>. Out of these two, <strong class="bold">Project Role</strong> is often the most flexible option, as it allows each project’s administrator to add users or groups to roles with permissions. Groups, on the other hand, often require either the Jira administrator or, in the case of LDAP, another IT administrator to add and remove users from individual groups.</p>
			<p>Other options, such as <strong class="bold">User custom field value</strong>, are a very flexible way to allow end users to control access. For example, you could have a custom field called <strong class="bold">Editors</strong>, and set up your <strong class="bold">Edit Issues</strong> permission to allow only users specified in the custom field to be able to edit issues.</p>
			<p>The custom field does not have to be placed on the usual view/edit screens for the permission to be applied. For example, you can have the custom field appear on a workflow transition called <strong class="bold">Submit to Manager</strong>. Once the user has selected the manager, only the manager will have permission to edit the issue.</p>
			<p>Revoking permissions is as simple as granting them. Here’s how you can do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Edit Permissions</strong> page for the permission scheme you wish to configure.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> link for the permission you wish to revoke, and click on <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> again.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>When you <a id="_idIndexMarker774"/>are trying to revoke permissions to prevent users from gaining access to certain things, you need to make sure no other options are granted the same permission that might be applied to the same user. For example, if you have both the <strong class="bold">Single user</strong> and <strong class="bold">Group</strong> options set for the <strong class="bold">Browse Projects</strong> permission, then you will need to make sure that you revoke the <strong class="bold">Single user</strong> option and also make sure that the user does not belong to the <strong class="bold">Group</strong> option selected so that you do not have a loophole in your permission settings.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>Applying a permission scheme</h2>
			<p>Once you <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>have your permission scheme <a id="_idIndexMarker776"/>configured, you can apply the scheme to your projects. There really is nothing special involved here. Permission schemes are applied to projects in the same way as notification and workflow schemes. Follow these next steps for instructions on how to configure these:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project administration page you want to apply the permission scheme to.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Use a different scheme</strong> option from the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu.</li>
				<li>Select a permission scheme you want to use.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Associate</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Permission <a id="_idIndexMarker777"/>schemes are applied <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>immediately, and you will be able to see the permissions take effect.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-272"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Issue security</h1>
			<p>We have seen how Jira administrators can restrict general access to Jira with application access and global permissions, and what project administrators can do to place permissions <a id="_idIndexMarker779"/>on individual projects through permission schemes. Jira allows you to take things to yet another level to allow ordinary users to set the security level on issues they are working with, with issue security.</p>
			<p>Issue security allows users to set view permissions (but not edit them) on issues by selecting one of the preconfigured issue security levels. This is a very powerful feature, as it allows the delegation of security control to the end users and empowers them (to a limited degree) to decide who can view their issues.</p>
			<p>On a high level, issue security works in a similar way to permission schemes. The Jira administrator will start by creating and configuring a set of issue security schemes with security levels set. Project administrators can then apply one of these schemes to their projects, which allows users (with the <strong class="bold">Set Issue Security</strong> project permission) to select security levels within the scheme and apply them to individual issues.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-273"><a id="_idTextAnchor275"/>Issue security schemes</h2>
			<p>As explained earlier, the starting point of using issue security is issue security schemes. It is the <a id="_idIndexMarker780"/>responsibility of the Jira administrator to create and design security levels so that they can be reused as much as possible.</p>
			<p>Jira does not come with any predefined issue security schemes, so you will have to create your own from scratch. Perform the following steps to create a new issue security scheme:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Issue security schemes</strong> option to bring up the <strong class="bold">Issue Security Schemes</strong> page, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.18_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.18 – Issue Security Schemes page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.18 – Issue Security Schemes page</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Click on the <strong class="bold">Add issue security scheme</strong> link.</li>
				<li>Enter a <a id="_idIndexMarker781"/>name and description for the new scheme.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to create a new issue security scheme.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Since an issue security scheme does not define a set of security levels like a permission scheme, you will need to create your own set of security levels right after you create your scheme.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-274"><a id="_idTextAnchor276"/>Configuring an issue security scheme</h2>
			<p>Unlike permission schemes, which have a list of predefined permissions, with issue security schemes, you need to define all the security levels you need. Each security level represents <a id="_idIndexMarker782"/>the level of security that users need to meet before Jira will allow them access to the requested issue. Note that even though they are called security levels, it does not mean that there are any forms of hierarchy among the set of levels you create.</p>
			<p>To add new security levels to your issue security scheme, proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Issue Security Schemes</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Security Levels</strong> link for the issue security scheme you wish to configure. This will take you to the page shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US"> </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.19_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.19 – Issue security levels&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.19 – Issue security levels</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Enter a name <a id="_idIndexMarker783"/>and description for the new security level in the <strong class="bold">Add Security Level</strong> section.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Security Level</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can add as many security levels as you like in a scheme. One good practice is to design and name your security levels based on your team or project roles (for example, <strong class="bold">Developers only</strong>).</p>
			<p>As with permission schemes, once you have your security levels in place, you will need to assign who will have access to each of the security levels. Users assigned to the security level will have permission to view issues with the specified security level. Proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> link for the security level you wish to assign users to.</li>
				<li>Select an option you wish to assign to the security level.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to assign users.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Just as with <a id="_idIndexMarker784"/>permission schemes, it is better to use options such as <strong class="bold">Project Role and Group</strong>, as they are more flexible and do not tie the security level to individual users, allowing you to control permission with options such as group association.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-275"><a id="_idTextAnchor277"/>Setting a default security level</h2>
			<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker785"/>set a security level to be the default option for issues if none is selected. This can be a useful feature for projects with a high-security requirement to prevent users (with the <strong class="bold">Set Issue Security</strong> permission) from forgetting to assign a security level for their issues. Follow these next steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Edit Issues Security Levels</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Default</strong> link for the security level you want to set as default.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once set as default, the security level will have <strong class="bold">Default</strong> next to its name. Now, when the user creates an issue and does not assign a security level, the default security level will be applied.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-276"><a id="_idTextAnchor278"/>Applying an issue security scheme</h2>
			<p>Just as with permission schemes, project administrators apply issue security schemes to projects. Applying an issue security scheme is similar to applying a workflow scheme, where <a id="_idIndexMarker786"/>there is an intermediate migration step involved. This is to ensure that existing issues with set issue security levels can be successfully migrated over to the new security levels in the scheme. Proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project administration page you want to apply the workflow scheme to.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Issue Security</strong> option from the left-hand panel.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Use a different scheme</strong> option from the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> menu.</li>
				<li>Select a permission scheme to use.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button to move to <em class="italic">step 2</em> of the process.</li>
				<li>Select a new security level to apply to an existing issue that may be affected by this change.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Associate</strong> button to apply the new issue security scheme.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that <a id="_idIndexMarker787"/>we have seen how to apply permissions to projects and issues, let’s take a look at how you can troubleshoot problems you might encounter due to incorrect permission settings.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-277"><a id="_idTextAnchor279"/>Troubleshooting permissions</h1>
			<p>Just as with notifications, it can be very frustrating to troubleshoot permission settings. To help <a id="_idIndexMarker788"/>with this, Jira also provides a <strong class="bold">Permission Helper</strong> tool to <a id="_idIndexMarker789"/>assist administrators with pinpointing settings that prevent users from accessing certain features.</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Permission Helper</strong> tool works <a id="_idIndexMarker790"/>similarly to the <strong class="bold">Notification Helper</strong> tool. Here’s how you can use it:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Permission helper</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Specify the user having access problems in the <strong class="bold">User</strong> field.</li>
				<li>Specify the issue to test with.</li>
				<li>Select the permission the user does not have (for example, <strong class="bold">Edit Issues</strong>).</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Submit</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can see an overview of the process in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.20_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.20 – Permission helper page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.20 – Permission helper page</p>
			<p>As shown <a id="_idIndexMarker791"/>in the preceding screenshot, the user <code>DEMO-4</code> because she does not have the required <strong class="bold">Internal Only</strong> issue security level defined by the issue security scheme used by the project and is not in the <strong class="bold">Developers</strong> project role needed by the permission scheme.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-278"><a id="_idTextAnchor280"/>Workflow security</h1>
			<p>The security features we have looked at so far are not applied to workflows. When securing <a id="_idIndexMarker792"/>your Jira setup, you will also need to consider who will be allowed to perform certain workflow transitions—for example, only users in the <strong class="bold">Managers</strong> group will be able to execute the <strong class="bold">Authorize</strong> transition on issues. For you to enforce security on workflows, you will have to set it on each transition you have by adding workflow conditions. Refer to <a href="B18644_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Workflow and Business Process</em>, which discusses workflows and conditions in more detail.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-279"><a id="_idTextAnchor281"/>Password policy</h1>
			<p>In most cases, unless you are using an SSO solution, you will be using a username and password combination to log in to Jira, so you will want users to choose strong passwords <a id="_idIndexMarker793"/>that cannot be easily guessed. If your organization is already enforcing a password policy and centrally managing authentication, such as via LDAP, then all you have to do is integrate Jira with it and you are good to go. However, if this is not the case, Jira comes with the ability for you to set a password policy to make sure your users do not choose simple, guessable passwords. To set up a password policy for Jira, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then <strong class="bold">Password Policy</strong>.</li>
				<li>Choose from one of the available options, with the <strong class="bold">Custom</strong> option allowing you to specify your own requirements.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Update</strong> button to apply the policy.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After you have applied your new password policy, existing user passwords will not be affected. However, if users try to change their own password, or if you are creating a new user account, Jira will make sure the password meets the requirements of the policy and will display an error message if the requirements are not met, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.21_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.21 – Password policy&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.21 – Password policy</p>
			<p>Next, let’s look <a id="_idIndexMarker794"/>at how to enable SSO with SAML.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-280"><a id="_idTextAnchor282"/>Enabling SSO with SAML</h1>
			<p>If your organization uses SAML for SSO, you can also configure Jira to participate in the SAML <a id="_idIndexMarker795"/>session so that your users will not need <a id="_idIndexMarker796"/>to log in to Jira every time they try <a id="_idIndexMarker797"/>to access the application. Also, if you have configured your SAML <strong class="bold">identity provider</strong> (<strong class="bold">IdP</strong>) with <strong class="bold">two-factor authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">2FA</strong>) for <a id="_idIndexMarker798"/>additional security, Jira gets that benefit as well.</p>
			<p>The one <a id="_idIndexMarker799"/>pre-requisite for enabling SAML SSO with Jira is that you must run Jira on <strong class="bold">Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure</strong> (<strong class="bold">HTTPS</strong>). If you have not configured your Jira setup to do so, please refer to <a href="B18644_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Getting Started with Jira Data Center</em>, for details.</p>
			<p>To enable SAML SSO with Jira, proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then <strong class="bold">Authentication methods</strong>, which will take you to the page shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.22_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.22 – Authentication methods page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.22 – Authentication methods page</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Click on the <strong class="bold">Add configuration</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Enter a name for the configuration. It is a good practice to name it after the IdP and authentication method—for example, <strong class="bold">Okta SAML</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the authentication method—in this case, <strong class="bold">SAML</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>After <a id="_idIndexMarker800"/>you have selected <strong class="bold">SAML</strong> as the authentication method, you will need to enter the <a id="_idIndexMarker801"/>details for your SAML configuration. The SAML configurations will be provided by your SAML-compliant IdP, such as Microsoft Azure AD, Okta, and Ping Identity. You will also need to provide <strong class="bold">Assertion Consumer Service URL</strong> and <strong class="bold">Audience URL (Entity ID)</strong> values to <a id="_idIndexMarker802"/>your IdP in order to register Jira as an application or <strong class="bold">service provider</strong> (<strong class="bold">SP</strong>). Lastly, you need to enter a value for <strong class="bold">Login button text</strong>. This is what will be displayed to the end users when they try to log in, so it should be something meaningful—for example, <strong class="bold">Log in with SSO</strong>. After you have entered all your configurations, click on the <strong class="bold">Save configuration</strong> button.</p>
			<p>Once you have added your SAML configuration, it will be shown as a login option on the login page, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.23_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.23 – SAML authentication&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.23 – SAML authentication</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Important note</p>
			<p class="callout">There <a id="_idIndexMarker803"/>is an option <a id="_idIndexMarker804"/>to hide the username and password option by toggling the <strong class="bold">Show on login page</strong> option for the default username and password authentication method.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-281"><a id="_idTextAnchor283"/>Enabling JIT provisioning</h2>
			<p>With SAML SSO, you can automatically create user accounts for new users when they first log in <a id="_idIndexMarker805"/>to Jira via SSO. Any subsequent logins will also automatically update the user account’s details, keeping the user’s Jira account and account in the IdP in sync.</p>
			<p>This is useful when you only want to create accounts on demand or are not synchronizing with your user directory such as LDAP to pull all your accounts into Jira. To enable JIT provisioning, proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> option for your SAML authentication method.</li>
				<li>Toggle on the <strong class="bold">JIT provisioning</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Enter the SAML attributes that should be used for the user’s display name, email, and groups. These are provided by your SAML IdP.</li>
				<li>Save your configuration.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once JIT <a id="_idIndexMarker806"/>provisioning is enabled, when a new user logs in to Jira via SAML SSO, Jira will create a new account based on the attributes provided by the SAML response. The account will also be updated every time the user logs in.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-282"><a id="_idTextAnchor284"/>Auditing system changes</h1>
			<p>When you have more than one Jira administrator managing your Jira instance, it can often lead to a <em class="italic">too many cooks</em> situation, or you simply would like to keep track of who made which <a id="_idIndexMarker807"/>changes and when. Jira tracks and records many changes to many of the key system features and provides you with a full audit log of all the activities that are going on. This helps you diagnose problems and also perform a security audit in your system. To access the audit log, follow these steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Audit log</strong> option.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As we can see from the following screenshot, the audit log keeps a track of changes such as custom fields, project roles, and more. You can filter the audit log based on the date and type, the person who made the change, and other options to help you narrow down the search:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.24_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.24 – Audit log&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.24 – Audit log</p>
			<p>You can also configure how and what Jira should track for the audit log. By going to the <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> option, you can select how long you want to keep the audit logs and what you want to track, as shown here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.25_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 9.25 – Audit log settings&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.25 – Audit log settings</p>
			<p>By default, Jira tracks <a id="_idIndexMarker808"/>all the items under the <strong class="bold">Coverage</strong> heading at a base level. If you want Jira to track more details for a particular item, simply change the <strong class="bold">Coverage level</strong> option to either <strong class="bold">Advanced</strong> or <strong class="bold">Full</strong>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-283"><a id="_idTextAnchor285"/>The HR project</h1>
			<p>In the previous chapters, you configured your Jira to capture data with customized screens and <a id="_idIndexMarker809"/>fields and processed the captured data through workflows. What you need to do now is secure the data you have gathered to make sure that only authorized users can access and manipulate issues.</p>
			<p>Since your HR project is used by the internal team, what you really need to do is put enough permissions around your issues to ensure that the data they hold does not get modified by other users by mistake. This allows us to mitigate human errors by handling access accordingly.</p>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker810"/>achieve this, you need to have the following requirements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You should know who belongs to the HR team</li>
				<li>Restrict issue assign operations to only the user that has submitted the ticket and members of the HR team</li>
				<li>Do not allow issues to be moved to other projects</li>
				<li>Limit the assignment of tickets to the reporter and members of the HR team</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Of course, there are a lot of other permissions we can apply here; the preceding four requirements will be a good starting point for us to build on further.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-284"><a id="_idTextAnchor286"/>Setting up groups</h2>
			<p>The first <a id="_idIndexMarker811"/>thing you need to do is to set up a new group for your help desk’s team members. This will help you distinguish normal Jira users from your help desk staff. Follow these steps to do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Group Browser</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Name the new group <code>hr-team</code> in the <strong class="bold">Add Group</strong> section.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add group</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You can create more groups for other teams and departments for your scenario here. Since anyone can log a ticket in your project, there is no need to make that distinction.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-285"><a id="_idTextAnchor287"/>Setting up user group association</h2>
			<p>With your <a id="_idIndexMarker812"/>group set up, you can start assigning members of your team to the new group, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Group Browser</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <code>hr-team</code> group.</li>
				<li>Select users with the user picker or simply type in usernames separated by a comma. This time, let’s add our <code>admin</code> user to the group.</li>
				<li>Click <a id="_idIndexMarker813"/>on the <strong class="bold">Add selected users</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-286"><a id="_idTextAnchor288"/>Setting up permission schemes</h2>
			<p>The next <a id="_idIndexMarker814"/>step is to set up permissions for our HR project, so you need to have your own permission scheme. As always, it is more efficient to copy the <strong class="bold">Default Permission Scheme</strong> as a baseline and make your modifications on top, since we are only making a few changes here. Proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Permission Schemes</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Copy</strong> link for <strong class="bold">Default Permission Scheme</strong>.</li>
				<li>Rename the new permission scheme <strong class="bold">HR Permission Scheme</strong>.</li>
				<li>Change the description to <code>Permission scheme designed for HR team projects</code>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that we have our base permission scheme set up, we can start on the fun part—interpreting requirements and implementing them in Jira.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-287"><a id="_idTextAnchor289"/>Setting up permissions</h2>
			<p>The first <a id="_idIndexMarker815"/>thing you need to do when you start setting up permissions is to try to match existing Jira permissions to your requirements. In our case, we want to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Restrict who can assign issues</li>
				<li>Restrict who can be assigned to an issue</li>
				<li>Disable issues from being moved</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Looking at the existing list of Jira permissions, you can see that we can match the requirements with the <strong class="bold">Assign Issues</strong>, <strong class="bold">Assignable Users</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Move Issues</strong> permissions, respectively.</p>
			<p>Once you work out which permissions you need to modify, the next step is to work out a strategy to specify users that should be given the permissions. Restricting the <strong class="bold">Move Issue</strong> options is simple. All you have to do is remove the permission for everyone, thus effectively preventing anyone from moving issues in your project.</p>
			<p>The next <a id="_idIndexMarker816"/>two requirements are similar, as they are both granted to the reporter (the user that submitted the ticket) and our new <code>hr-team</code> group. Follow the next steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Permission Schemes</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> link for <strong class="bold">HR Permission Scheme</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Grant permission</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Select both the <strong class="bold">Assign Issues</strong> and <strong class="bold">Assignable Users</strong> permissions.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Reporter</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Repeat the steps and grant the <code>hr-team</code> group both permissions.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By selecting both permissions in one go, you have quickly granted multiple permissions to users. Now, you need to remove all users granted with the <strong class="bold">Move Issues</strong> permission. There should be only one granted at the moment, <strong class="bold">Any logged in user</strong>, but if you have more than one, you will need to remove all of them. Here’s how you can do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Permission Schemes</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> link for <strong class="bold">HR Permission Scheme</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Remove</strong> link for all users that have been granted the <strong class="bold">Move Issues</strong> permission.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>That’s it! You’ve addressed all your permission requirements with just a few clicks.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-288"><a id="_idTextAnchor290"/>Putting it together</h2>
			<p>Last, but <a id="_idIndexMarker817"/>not least, you can now put on your project administrator’s hat and apply your new permission scheme to your HR project, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the project administration page for your HR project.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Permissions</strong> option and select your new HR permission scheme.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Associate</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>By associating the permission scheme with your project, you have applied all your permission changes. Now, if you create a new issue or edit an existing issue, you will notice that the list of assignees will no longer include all the users in Jira.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-289"><a id="_idTextAnchor291"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we looked at how we can integrate Jira with user repositories, such as LDAP, through user directories, and Jira’s user management options with groups and project roles.
