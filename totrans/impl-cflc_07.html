<h1 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Creating a Space for Product Management</h1>
<p>As remote work is becoming more prevalent, maintaining efficient communication and collaboration among teams, especially product management teams, can be challenging. Confluence was built to address these challenges, offering a shared workspace where teams can collaborate, create, and manage all their work in one place.</p>
<p>Product management teams are responsible<a id="_idIndexMarker575"/> for guiding the success of a product and leading the cross-functional team responsible for improving it. This involves planning, forecasting, producing, and marketing a product or products at all stages of the product life cycle. With team members potentially spread across different locations and time zones, having a centralized platform for collaboration is crucial.</p>
<p>Confluence is a content collaboration tool used to help teams collaborate and share knowledge efficiently. With Confluence, your remote product management team can create, share, and collaborate on projects in one place to keep its work organized and accessible. The platform allows teams to develop product requirements, project plans, meeting notes, and so on, all while integrating seamlessly with Atlassian’s other product, Jira, to track tasks and manage projects.</p>
<p>Whether it’s planning a new product feature, outlining marketing strategies, or detailing product requirements, Confluence provides a single source of truth for your product management team. It encourages active collaboration by enabling team members to comment on pages, contribute to discussions, and give real-time feedback. This helps ensure everyone stays on the same page, reducing misunderstandings and keeping work flowing smoothly.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Confluence’s robust set of features can be tailored to your team’s specific needs. Spaces can be created for individual teams or projects and structured according to different needs; thus, Confluence becomes a flexible tool for your team where each space is a central hub for related pages, keeping work organized and easy to find.</p>
<p>In other words, Confluence can be the backbone of your remote product management team, fostering effective collaboration and ensuring everyone stays aligned and informed. We are now ready to discover how.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Exploring product management roles</h1>

<li><strong class="bold">Documentation of analysis</strong>: They need to<a id="_idIndexMarker594"/> document their analysis methods and findings. Confluence provides a platform for detailed documentation.</li>
</ul>
<p>By providing a centralized space for communication, collaboration, and documentation, Confluence can meet the diverse needs of various roles within a product management team.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-168"><a id="_idTextAnchor169"/>Remote product management challenges</h1>
<p>There are a lot of <a id="_idIndexMarker595"/>challenges specifically faced by remote product management teams. Let's discuss on some of them and how Confluence Cloud can help mitigate these issues.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-169"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Prioritization and roadmap visibility</h2>
<p>Remote product teams can <a id="_idIndexMarker596"/>struggle with keeping everyone aligned on product priorities and upcoming features. The absence of an in-person environment can lead to misunderstandings and misalignments. Confluence Cloud can aid in maintaining the visibility of a product roadmap. You can create a dedicated page for your roadmap where priorities are clearly defined and regularly updated. This ensures everyone in the team is on the same page.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-170"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Cross-functional collaboration</h2>
<p>Product managers often work <a id="_idIndexMarker597"/>closely with various departments such as engineering, design, marketing, and sales. Remote work can make cross-functional collaborations more challenging, so Confluence Cloud provides a platform where all these departments can collaborate and share their work. Each department can have its page within the product space, making it easier to share updates and collaborate effectively.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-171"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Customer feedback collection</h2>
<p>For product teams, collecting <a id="_idIndexMarker598"/>and analyzing customer feedback is crucial. However, in a remote setup, centralizing this feedback can be difficult. Confluence Cloud can serve as a centralized repository for all customer feedback. It can be categorized and tagged for easier analysis, ensuring all voices are heard and considered in product decisions.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-172"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Knowledge transfer</h2>
<p>In product management, there’s <a id="_idIndexMarker599"/>often a lot of information to be shared regarding the product, market, competitors, and so on. In a remote environment, this pool of knowledge transfer can be challenging. Confluence Cloud can be used as a knowledge base where all important product and market information is stored, ensuring that all team members can access the same information, regardless of location.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-173"><a id="_idTextAnchor174"/>Product releases and change management</h2>
<p>Coordinating product releases<a id="_idIndexMarker600"/> and managing changes remotely can be challenging due to the lack of real-time communication. Confluence Cloud can help you manage product releases and changes more efficiently. You can create detailed release plans and change logs, assign tasks, set deadlines, and track progress all in one place. By creating a space on Confluence Cloud, you can centralize communication, facilitate cross-functional collaboration, streamline customer feedback collection and analysis, enhance the transfer of knowledge, and manage product releases and changes more effectively.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-174"><a id="_idTextAnchor175"/>Cloud-based tools used by product managers</h1>
<p>Product management teams working remotely and asynchronously often utilize cloud-based tools to facilitate their work. These tools typically span several categories – project management, communication, collaboration, documentation, and prototyping. Here’s a list of standard tools for each function:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Project management</strong>: Tools such as Jira<a id="_idIndexMarker601"/> and Trello help teams track tasks, manage backlogs, and coordinate project progress. These tools are essential to manage workflows, assign tasks, and monitor progress.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Communication</strong>: Tools such as Slack, Microsoft <a id="_idIndexMarker602"/>Teams, and Zoom are used for instant messaging, video conferencing, and maintaining regular communication within a team.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Collaboration and documentation</strong>: This is <a id="_idIndexMarker603"/>where Confluence excels. Confluence is a workspace where teams can create, share, and collaborate on documents in real time, making it ideal for creating project plans, meeting notes, product requirements, and so on.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Prototyping and design</strong>: Tools such as <a id="_idIndexMarker604"/>Sketch, Figma, and Adobe XD are commonly used to create product designs and interactive prototypes.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">File sharing</strong>: Dropbox, Google Drive, and<a id="_idIndexMarker605"/> OneDrive are used to store and share files across a team.</li>
</ul>
<p>Confluence integrates seamlessly with many of these tools, especially those within the Atlassian ecosystem such as Jira and Trello. For instance, you can embed Jira issues directly into your Confluence pages or link Confluence pages to Jira issues, allowing a seamless transition between planning, documenting, and tracking work. Also, you can integrate Confluence with communication tools such as Slack. For example, you can set up notifications in your Slack channels for updates to Confluence pages, making sure your team stays informed about changes to important documents.</p>
<p>These integrations make Confluence a central hub for product management teams working remotely, allowing them to maintain transparency, collaborate effectively, and keep all necessary documentation in one accessible place. This can lead to improved productivity and alignment across a team, regardless of where team members are physically located.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-175"><a id="_idTextAnchor176"/>Exploring the product management templates in Confluence</h1>
<p>As of June 2023, there are 131 templates on<a id="_idIndexMarker606"/> Confluence. When you filter them, you will see that there are 19 templates for product management, as shown in the following screenshot. In this section, we will give you a summary of these templates. Also, note that this number may have increased by the time you read this book.</p>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.3 – The MVP ideation template</p>
<p>As shown in the<a id="_idIndexMarker630"/> previous <a id="_idIndexMarker631"/>screenshot, the most basic features of Confluence, such as layout and table, are used in this template. Although it may not seem technically complex, it is certainly a very useful template.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-177"><a id="_idTextAnchor178"/>Product launch</h2>
<p>This one can be<a id="_idIndexMarker632"/> considered a big<a id="_idIndexMarker633"/> template. Therefore, we will only discuss some areas of it. First, we will discuss the <strong class="bold">Product release roadmap</strong> section. Here, the Confluence macro named <strong class="bold">Roadmap Planner</strong> is used. With this macro, you can create a basic roadmap for your team.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_07_04_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.4 – The Product release roadmap section from the Product launch template</p>
<p>As you can see, adding <a id="_idIndexMarker634"/>Trello or <a id="_idIndexMarker635"/>Jira content to Confluence is possible. In the following figure, you can see the <strong class="bold">Distribution channels &amp; launch activities</strong> section. Here, you can plan your launch-day activities day by day.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_07_05_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.5 – The Distribution channels &amp; launch activities section from the Product launch template</p>
<p>As you can see in the <a id="_idIndexMarker636"/>previous <a id="_idIndexMarker637"/>screenshot, a table is used in this section. Some cells of the table are merged and colored.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-178"><a id="_idTextAnchor179"/>Product requirements</h2>
<p>This is a great template <a id="_idIndexMarker638"/>that begins<a id="_idIndexMarker639"/> with an imprint section. In it, you can add stakeholders to this document, and it is worth remembering that all stakeholders added here will be notified of updates to the document. In this section, the macro named <strong class="bold">Page Properties</strong> is used. Thanks to this macro, we can easily access the information in this part of the page from another page.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_07_06_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.6 – The Page Properties section from the Product requirements template</p>
<p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, there is a natural integration between Jira and Confluence. This template shows that epics <a id="_idIndexMarker640"/>and<a id="_idIndexMarker641"/> issues from Jira can be added to this document.</p>
<p>In the <strong class="bold">Requirements</strong> section, you can define the product requirements in detail.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_07_07_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.7 – The Requirements section from the Product requirements template</p>
<p>As you can see in the previous screenshot, a simple table is also used in this section. However, this table includes a status macro (the element currently marked as <strong class="bold">HIGH</strong>). Also, the template invites us to integrate with Jira. We must clarify all the details about the requirements in this section of Confluence, then transfer each requirement as an issue to Jira, and track it there.</p>
<p>Then, there is the <strong class="bold">User interaction and design</strong> section. This area currently appears to be quite small. However, it can quickly become an area that takes up a lot of space. You can add various formats of content to this area. You can even enable embedding content from Miro, Google Drive, and so on. This way, you can easily view your content on different platforms through this Confluence template.</p>
<p>You might be wondering what a Jira issue that has been added to a Confluence page looks like. If so, we recommend examining the next screenshot.</p>

<p>As you can see, you can add diagrams and screenshots to this section.</p>
<p>When determining <a id="_idIndexMarker642"/>product requirements, you may encounter numerous questions that need to be answered. A simple table can record, track, and answer these questions.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_07_10_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.10 – The Open Questions section from the Product requirements template</p>
<p>As you can see in the <a id="_idIndexMarker643"/>previous <a id="_idIndexMarker644"/>screenshot, a simple table is used here as well. Tables are among the frequently used macros on Confluence for various purposes.</p>
<p>We have examined three templates in a row. We are now ready to explore other templates to help you create your own.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-179"><a id="_idTextAnchor180"/>Creating a single source of truth for product management</h1>
<p>A <strong class="bold">Single Source of Truth</strong> (<strong class="bold">SSOT</strong>) refers <a id="_idIndexMarker645"/>to having one primary, authoritative data source that all users agree is the real, trusted number. This concept is <a id="_idIndexMarker646"/>widely used in information systems and data management, especially in complex environments where multiple teams, departments, or stakeholders need access to the same information.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-180"><a id="_idTextAnchor181"/>Why do product managers need an SSOT?</h2>
<p>For asynchronous and remote<a id="_idIndexMarker647"/> product management, an SSOT is particularly crucial for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Consistency</strong>: With an SSOT, everyone on the team works from the same information. This eliminates discrepancies or conflicts in data, ensuring everyone is on the same page, regardless of location or time zone.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Efficiency</strong>: An SSOT reduces the time spent searching for information, clarifying misunderstandings, or reconciling conflicting versions of data. When everyone knows where to find the right information, work can proceed more smoothly and efficiently.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Collaboration</strong>: An SSOT facilitates collaboration by providing a common ground for all team members. It simplifies the exchange of information and the coordination of tasks, especially in remote settings where face-to-face interactions are limited.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Decision-making</strong>: Reliable and consistent data is fundamental for informed decision-making. With an SSOT, decision-makers can trust their decisions to be based on accurate and up-to-date information.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-181"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>How to create an SSOT optimized for product management using Confluence</h2>
<p>Let’s look at how to create an SSOT<a id="_idIndexMarker648"/> optimized for product management using Confluence:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Set up a dedicated Confluence space</strong>: Create a dedicated space in Confluence for your product management activities. This will be the central location where all product-related information is stored and updated.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Emphasize important information</strong>: Ensure key information, such as team goals and project milestones, are prominently displayed on the space home page so that important details are immediately visible to anyone accessing the space.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Use shortcuts and the page tree</strong>: To keep information accessible, use the page tree feature in Confluence. This allows quick navigation to different pages within the space, such as project roadmaps, meeting notes, and important files.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Create a project space for complex projects</strong>: If a project requires more documentation, consider creating a separate project space. This space should include key components, such as the project’s vision, stakeholders, goals, and progress-tracking metrics.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Document product requirements</strong>: Use Confluence’s product requirements blueprint to document the product’s requirements. This should include high-level details, goals, business objectives, user stories, design reviews, and traceability to Jira issues.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Update regularly</strong>: An SSOT is only as good as its data. Ensure that the information in Confluence is regularly updated and reflects the current state of a product.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Encourage usage</strong>: Make sure all team members are trained to use Confluence and understand its role as an SSOT. The more it is used, the more valuable it will become as a central repository of information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following these steps, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker649"/>leverage Confluence to create a powerful SSOT for your product management activities while facilitating collaboration, improving efficiency, and driving informed decision-making.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-182"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Using Confluence in conjunction with product management tools</h1>
<p>In the digital age, collaboration<a id="_idIndexMarker650"/> tools have become essential for teams to manage their work efficiently. They facilitate communication, streamline workflows, and help manage and organize various tasks, driving productivity and efficiency. Among these tools, Atlassian’s Confluence stands out, thanks to its comprehensive features designed for content collaboration.</p>
<p>Confluence serves as an efficient platform to create an SSOT, where teams can collaborate in real time to create, share, and update documents. Its seamless integration with other Atlassian tools (Jira, Trello, etc.) makes it a powerful platform for project management. When combined with these tools, Confluence can significantly enhance team collaboration, enabling teams to maintain project transparency, improve the visibility of tasks, and ensure everyone is aligned toward the same goals.</p>
<p>Now, we are ready to take a brief look at how Confluence can be effectively used alongside cloud-based tools used by product managers worldwide. The objective is to help you understand the potential of these integrations and how they can contribute to maximizing your team’s productivity.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_07_11_B16861.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.11 – Using Confluence in conjunction with product management tools</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-183"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Project management tools (e.g., Jira and Trello)</h2>
<p>Confluence can be tightly <a id="_idIndexMarker651"/>integrated with project<a id="_idIndexMarker652"/> management tools to enhance the visibility and traceability of work items. For instance, you can link Jira issues and Confluence pages with Jira, allowing your team to directly see the <a id="_idIndexMarker653"/>background, discussion, and design related to a particular issue from the Jira ticket. You can also create Jira issues instantly from Confluence. This integration helps ensure that all team members have access to the same information and understand the context behind each task.</p>
<p>We will discuss the integration of Jira and<a id="_idIndexMarker654"/> Confluence in detail in <a href="B16861_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor316"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>. However, we want to give you an idea now of how well these two products integrate with each other. In the following screenshot, you can see the first step to easily convert a selected paragraph on a Confluence page into a task in Jira.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_07_12_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.12 – Creating a Jira issue from Confluence (step 1)</p>
<p>As shown in the previous screenshot, the steps you need to follow are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the relevant text.</li>
<li>Right-click.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create </strong><strong class="bold">issue</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, you need to select in which Jira project and of what type the issue will be created. You can see this user interface in the following screenshot.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_07_13_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 7.13 – Creating a Jira issue from Confluence (step 2)</p>
<p>You can see the fields that need to be filled in to create the issue in Jira in the previous screenshot. At this stage, you should first select in which project and of what type the issue will be created. Then, you can update the summary<a id="_idIndexMarker655"/> of this issue, and finally, you should enter a description. In this example, an issue of type <code>Task</code> will be created in the Jira project named <code>Sample </code><code>Jira Project</code>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-184"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Communication tools (e.g., Slack and Microsoft Teams)</h2>
<p>While Confluence is a<a id="_idIndexMarker656"/> powerful tool <a id="_idIndexMarker657"/>for asynchronous communication and documentation, tools such as Slack and Microsoft Teams are often used for more immediate, synchronous communication. You can integrate Confluence with these tools to <a id="_idIndexMarker658"/>get notifications in your chat when updates are made to Confluence pages. This helps keep the team informed in real time about important updates, even if they’re working remotely and asynchronously.</p>

<h1 id="_idParaDest-188"><a id="_idTextAnchor189"/>Leveraging Confluence and Jira for effective product management in remote and asynchronous teams</h1>
<p>Today, effective product <a id="_idIndexMarker668"/>management is considered critical to the success of any organization. It involves orchestrating numerous interconnected tasks, from conceptualization and design to development and final deployment. This complex process is often further complicated by the rise of remote and asynchronous work models, which can introduce unique challenges such as communication gaps and coordination issues. However, tools such as Jira and Confluence can significantly streamline the product management process by offering comprehensive solutions tailored for remote and asynchronous work environments.</p>
<p>Jira, a leading project management tool, excels at task tracking and workflow management. Meanwhile, Confluence is perfect for documentation and collaboration, providing a robust knowledge management system for teams. When used together, these platforms can address the key challenges faced by remote and asynchronous product management teams, fostering a culture of transparency, alignment, and efficiency. In this section, you’ll discover the synergy between Jira and Confluence in product management, with real-world scenarios demonstrating their combined potential.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-189"><a id="_idTextAnchor190"/>Scenario 1 – project planning and tracking</h2>
<p>The planning phase is crucial<a id="_idIndexMarker669"/> for any project. This stage involves defining the scope, objectives, and deliverables. With Confluence, product managers can create a project space where all this information can be documented and easily accessed by a team. This space can also provide a snapshot of the project’s goals, stakeholders, and progress metrics. Once the project is underway, tasks and deliverables can be tracked using Jira. This integration allows for a seamless transition from project planning in Confluence to execution in Jira. It gives teams a clear view of what needs to be done, who is responsible, and how progress is tracked against the project plan.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-190"><a id="_idTextAnchor191"/>Scenario 2 – managing product requirements</h2>
<p>When developing a new product or<a id="_idIndexMarker670"/> feature, capturing and managing requirements is key. Confluence offers a collaborative space where requirements can be documented in detail, including goals, business objectives, strategic fit, and user stories. Requirements can then be linked directly to Jira, broken into actionable tasks, and assigned to the respective team members. This integration ensures that all team members understand what needs to be developed and why, providing a direct line of sight from the high-level requirement to the individual tasks needed to implement it.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-191"><a id="_idTextAnchor192"/>Scenario 3 – collaborative decision-making</h2>
<p>In a remote and asynchronous <a id="_idIndexMarker671"/>environment, fostering collaboration can be a challenge. However, Confluence and Jira make collaborative decision-making easier. Confluence can create a dedicated space for decision-making where team members can share their thoughts, ideas, and feedback. This space can also serve as a repository for all decisions made, providing a historical record that can be referred to in the future. Additionally, Jira can track decision-making tasks, ensuring that all necessary decisions are made promptly.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-192"><a id="_idTextAnchor193"/>Scenario 4 – team and project spaces</h2>
<p>Having centralized spaces for teams <a id="_idIndexMarker672"/>and projects can enhance collaboration and communication in a remote and asynchronous setting. Confluence provides a platform to create spaces where all relevant information can be shared, discussed, and updated in real time. Team members can quickly see who is working on what, the status of different tasks, and upcoming deliverables. This visibility is especially crucial in an asynchronous work setting where real-time communication is not an option.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-193"><a id="_idTextAnchor194"/>Scenario 5 – documenting and sharing knowledge</h2>
<p>Confluence and Jira can facilitate knowledge <a id="_idIndexMarker673"/>sharing across an organization. For example, after a project is completed, a post-project<a id="_idIndexMarker674"/> review can be documented in Confluence, capturing key learnings, challenges encountered, and how they were addressed. Other teams can then easily access this knowledge, helping them avoid similar project challenges. Similarly, Jira can be used to record and track bugs, issues, and their resolutions, creating a knowledge base that can be referred to in the future.</p>
<p>In conclusion, using Jira and Confluence in harmony can revolutionize product management in remote and asynchronous work settings. These tools can mitigate the common challenges associated with distributed work models by bridging communication gaps, fostering collaboration, and keeping all stakeholders in the loop. From creating a unified space for team collaboration to documenting product requirements, tracking project progress, and conducting efficient retrospectives, they can seamlessly handle the full spectrum of product management tasks. As each organization is unique, the key is to adapt and tailor these tools according to specific needs and workflows, thereby harnessing their full potential.</p>
<p>Remember, the journey toward effective product management is iterative and continuous. As teams evolve and grow, so should the tools and processes they employ. Embrace the combined power of Jira and Confluence, and embark on a journey toward enhanced productivity, collaboration, and success in your product management endeavors.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-194"><a id="_idTextAnchor195"/>Summary</h1>
<p>Although the world of product management is dynamic and rewarding, it comes with specific challenges. With teams often spread across different time zones, working remotely and asynchronously, maintaining a cohesive and well-aligned group can be tricky. This is where Confluence can become a powerful, professional ally.</p>
<p>Confluence offers a centralized platform where your team can create, share, and discuss all its projects, acting as a lynchpin to keep everyone on the same page. The space home page is a team dashboard, allowing anyone to quickly understand important upcoming deliverables and see what their teammates are working on. It’s crucial to highlight the most important information, such as team identity and quarterly goals, making it immediately noticeable. Space shortcuts and a well-structured page tree enhance the accessibility of information and make it easy for anyone to find relevant work or see what a team is currently focused on. The overview page, shortcuts, and page tree are all highly customizable, as shown in the following screenshot, and they can be designed to form a powerful team dashboard.</p>
