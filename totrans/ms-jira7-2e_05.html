One such popular add-on is <strong>Zephyr</strong> that brings in fully-fledged test management in JIRA. In this section, we will learn how to configure and use Zephyr.</p><p>The topics covered are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing the Zephyr plugin</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Zephyr terminology</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Starting to use Zephyr</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec40"/>Installing the Zephyr plugin</h1></div></div></div><p>Zephyr is a paid add-on that is very popular in the industry. If you want to quickly get the features of test management without customizing JIRA yourself, you can use Zephyr. It offers lots of useful test management features that are as per industry standards.</p><p>In this section, we will learn how to configure and use Zephyr. Follow the steps below to install it on your instance:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Add-ons</strong> | <strong>Find new add-ons</strong> under <strong>ATLASSIAN MARKETPLACE,</strong> type <code class="literal">Zephyr</code> in the search box and press the <em>Enter</em> key:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_001.jpg" alt="Installing the Zephyr plugin"/></div><p>

In the pop-up window that appears next, click on the <strong>Accept</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">Finally, you will be asked to enter your Atlassian account to generate a trial license for Zephyr:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_002.jpg" alt="Installing the Zephyr plugin"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Once installed, you will get a new menu item, <strong>Tests</strong>, in your instance.</li></ol></div><p>We have just installed Zephyr; now we will learn how to configure this add-on.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec41"/>Zephyr terminology</h1></div></div></div><p>The Zephyr add-on works very closely with your existing JIRA project but there are some terms that we need to understand before we start using this add-on:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Test</strong>: This is the test case and a detailed description of what needs to be tested</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Execution</strong>: Each test that is run along with its result</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Test cycle</strong>: This is a grouping of tests which may be for a particular project's version</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Ad hoc cycle</strong>: All the tests that are executed without a defined cycle are run in an ad hoc cycle</li></ul></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch05lvl1sec42"/>Starting to use Zephyr</h1></div></div></div><p>The Zephyr add-on may seem overwhelming at the beginning to new users but in this section, let us learn how to quickly configure this add-on and use it for performing tests.</p><p>The steps mentioned below will get you started with the Zephyr add-on in the shortest amount of time:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">The <strong>Test Issue Type</strong> is by default added to all new projects of <strong>Software</strong> and <strong>Business</strong> project types, but you can always add it to your project by modifying the <strong>Issue Type Scheme</strong>.

</p><div><img src="img/image_05_005.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Project Administration</strong> and check under <strong>Issue types</strong>; you will notice that the <strong>Issue Type Test</strong> has been added automatically in your project. You are now ready to start using Zephyr for testing.</li><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Project Administration</strong> | <strong>Versions</strong> and add a few versions, such as <code class="literal">Version 1.0</code>, <code class="literal">Version 1.1</code>, <code class="literal">Version 1.2</code>, or any name of your choice.</li><li class="listitem">Go back to your project's navigation sidebar and click on the new item <strong>Tests</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_006.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">There are three tabs here—<strong>Test Summary</strong>, <strong>Test Cycles</strong>, and <strong>Traceability</strong>. Click on the <strong>Test Cycles</strong> tab. You will find an <strong>Ad hoc</strong> cycle already defined for our project. Let us add a new test cycle. Under <strong>Cycle Summary</strong>, click on the <strong>Create New Cycle</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_007.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Create New Cycle</strong> popup, select <code class="literal">Version 1.0</code> as the<strong> Version</strong> and <strong>Name</strong> as <code class="literal">Functionality</code>.

</p><div><img src="img/image_05_008.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Just like <code class="literal">Version 1.0</code>, also add <code class="literal">Functional</code> and <code class="literal">Regression</code> test cycles for <code class="literal">Version 1.1</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Create</strong> button in the navigation menu. In the <strong>Create Issue</strong> popup, select your project and <strong>Test</strong> as the <strong>Issue Type</strong>, enter a <strong>Summary</strong>, and scroll down until you see the section for <strong>Zephyr Teststep</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_009.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the three sections, enter <strong>Test Step</strong>, <strong>Test Data</strong>, and <strong>Expected Result</strong>, and press the <strong>Add</strong> button. You can add multiple test steps in a similar way. Let us add one more and finally click on the <strong>Create</strong> button to create the test. The issue will now be created and under the <strong>Test Details</strong> section, you will notice the two test steps that we added are visible. You will notice that the default workflow buttons are not displayed for issue of type <strong>Test</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Now we have to execute the test. Under the <strong>Test Details</strong> section, there is another section for <strong>Test Executions</strong>. Initially, this section will be empty. You can either click on the <strong>Execute</strong> button on top of the issue or click on the link <strong>here</strong> under this section to create an execution:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_010.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Execute Test</strong> popup, select <strong>Add to Existing Test Cycle and Execute</strong>, then select a specific <strong>Version</strong> and the <strong>Test Cycle</strong> drop-down list will then display the test cycles that we earlier associated with that version. In the <strong>Assignee</strong> section, select <strong>Me</strong> if you want to assign this execution to yourself or select the name of the <strong>Person</strong> from the drop-down list. Then click on the <strong>Execute</strong> button. Create more <strong>Test Executions</strong> for another <strong>Version</strong> and <strong>Test Cycle</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_011.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Initially, the status of each test execution is <strong>UNEXECUTED</strong>. To start the execution, click on the <strong>E</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_012.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">We are now executing an individual <strong>Test Execution</strong> where various test steps added for this <strong>Test</strong> can be found. Each <strong>Test Step</strong> needs to be individually tested for <strong>Test Data</strong> and the output is compared with the <strong>Expected Result</strong>; based on the output, the test step<strong> Status</strong> can be changed from <strong>UNEXECUTED</strong> to <strong>PASS</strong>, <strong>FAIL</strong>, <strong>WIP</strong>, or <strong>BLOCKED</strong>. Just click on <strong>UNEXECUTED</strong> and a drop-down list will appear. If any bug is found then it can be associated with this <strong>Test Step</strong>. Click on <strong>Enter Defects</strong> and it will give you an option to either associate an existing JIRA issue or let you create new issue:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_013.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Apart from the individual <strong>Status</strong> of the <strong>Test Step</strong>, the overall execution <strong>Status</strong> of the test can also be changed in a similar way:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_05_014.jpg" alt="Starting to use Zephyr"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">As you start executing the <strong>Test Executions</strong> and change their <strong>Status</strong>, the <strong>Test Executions</strong> section will display a consolidated summary of all the test cycles. Go back to the project navigation sidebar, click on the <strong>Tests</strong> | <strong>Test Cycles</strong> tab, and select a particular version and you will get a <strong>Cycle Summary</strong> displaying the <strong>Test Cycles</strong> that we created, along with all the tests associated with them and the overall progress in percentage of that test cycle:<p>
