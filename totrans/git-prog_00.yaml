- en: Version control is essential to every programming project, as will be explained
    in chapter 1, and Git is the world's most popular version control system. The
    larger the team the more urgent it is that you use version control, but it can
    be essential for a single programmer as well.

    and clone it from GitHub. You will see the relationship between the repository

    learn about branching: a central concept in version control and one of Git''s
    great strengths. Branching allows you to work on more than one thing at a time
    and keeps your release code clean. Git has especially fast branching.'
