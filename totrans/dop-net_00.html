DevOps, as you are probably well-aware, is an abbreviated amalgamation of "Development" and "Operations", so why does it have any significance to networking? It is true that there is no "Net" in the DevOps name, though it is fair to say that the remit of DevOps has extended well beyond its initial goal.</p><p>The initial DevOps movement sought to remove the "chucking it over the fence" and reactive mentality that existed between development and operations teams, but DevOps can be efficiently used to promote collaboration between all teams in IT, not just Development and Operations staff.</p><p>DevOps, as a concept, initially aimed to solve the scenario where developers would develop code, make significant architectural changes, and not consider the Operations team that needed to deploy the code to production. So when the time came for the operations team to deploy the developers' code changes to production, this would result in a broken deployment, meaning crucial software fixes or new products would not reach customers as planned, and the deployment process would typically take days or weeks to fix.</p><p>This led to frustration to all the teams involved, as developers would have to stop coding new features and instead would have to help operations staff fix the deployment process. Operations teams would also be frustrated, as often they would not have been told that infrastructure changes were required to deploy the new release to production. As a result, the operations team did not have the idea to adequately prepare the production environment to support the architectural changes.</p><p>This common IT scenario highlights the broken process and operational model that would happen continually and cause friction between development and operations teams.</p><p>"DevOps" was an initiative setup to foster an environment of collaboration and communication between these previously conflicting teams. It promotes teams to speak daily, making each other aware of changes and consequently preventing avoidable situations from happening. So, it just so happens that development and operations staff were the first set of silos that DevOps aimed to solve. Consequently, it branded DevOps as a way to unify the teams to work, as one consolidated fluid function, but it could easily have been called something else.</p><p>DevOps aims to create better working relationships between teams and a happier working environment, as frankly nobody enjoys conflict or firefighting preventable issues on a daily basis. It also aims to share knowledge between teams to prevent the development teams being viewed as "ignorant to infrastructure" and operations teams to be "blockers to changes" and "slowing down devs". These are the common misconceptions that teams working in silos have of one another when they don't take the time to understand each other's goals.</p><p>DevOps strives to build an office environment where teams appreciate other teams and their aims, and they are respectful of their common goals. DevOps is undoubtedly one most talked about topics in the IT industry today. It is not a coincidence that its popularity has risen with the emergence of agile software development, as an alternative to using the more traditional waterfall approach.</p><p>Waterfall development and the "V-Model" encompass the separate phases of analysis, design, implementation (coding), and testing. These phases are split up traditionally into different isolated teams, with formalized project hand-off dates that are set in stone.</p><p>Agile was born out of the realization that in the fast-paced software industry, long running projects were suboptimal and not the best way of delivering real value to customers. As a result, agile has moved projects to shorter iteration cycles that incorporated analysis, design, implementation, and testing into two-week cycles (sprints) and aimed at using a prototyping approach instead.</p><p>The prototyping approach uses the notion of incremental development, which has allowed companies to gather feedback on products earlier in the release cycle, rather than utilizing a big bang approach that delivered the full solution in one big chunk at the end of the implementation phase.</p><p>Delivering projects in a waterfall fashion at the end of the waterfall implementation stage ran the risk of delivering products that customers did not want or where developers had misinterpreted requirements. These issues were typically only discovered in the final test phase when the project was ready to be taken to market. This often resulted in projects being deemed a failure or resulting in huge delays, whereas costly rework and change requests could be actioned.</p><p>Agile software development for the best part has fostered the need to collapse down those team silos that were typically associated with waterfall software development, and this strengthened the need for daily collaboration.</p><p>With the introduction of agile software development, it also has changed the way software testing is carried out too, with the same DevOps principles also being applied to testing functions.</p><p>Quality assurance test teams can no longer afford to be reactive either, much like operations teams before them. So, this promoted the need for test teams to work more efficiently and not delay products reaching market. This, however, could not be done at the expense of the product, so they needed to find a way to make sure applications are tested adequately and pass all quality assurance checks while working in a smarter way.</p><p>It was readily accepted that quality assurance test teams can no longer operate in silos separate from development teams; instead, agile software development has promoted test cases being written in parallel to the software development, so they are not a separate activity. This is in stark contrast to code being deployed into a test environment and left to a team of testers to execute manual tests or run a set of test packs where they deal with issues reactively.</p><p>Agile has promoted developers and quality assurance testers to instead work together in scrum teams on a daily basis to test software before it is packaged for deployment, with those same tests then being maintained and kept up to date and used to seed the regression test packs.</p><p>This has been used to mitigate the friction caused by developers checking in code changes that break quality assurance test team's regression packs. With siloed test teams, a common scenario that would often cause friction is be that a graphical user interface (GUI) would suddenly be changed by a developer, resulting in a portion of regression tests breaking. This change would be done without notifying the test team. The tests would be failing because they were written for an old GUI and were suddenly outdated, as opposed to breaking because developers had actually introduced a software failure or a bug.</p><p>This reactive approach to testing did not build confidence in the validity of the test failures reported by automated test packs as they are not always conclusively down to a software failure, and this introduced unnecessary delays due to suboptimal IT structure.</p><p>Instead if the communication between development and test teams had been better, using the principles promoted by DevOps, then these delays and suboptimal ways of working can be avoided.</p><p>More recently, we have seen the emergence of DevSecOps that have looked at integrating security and compliance into the software delivery process, as opposed to being bolted on manual actions and separate reactive initiatives. DevSecOps has looked at using DevOps and agile philosophies and embraced the idea of embedding security engineers in scrum teams to make sure that security requirements are met at the point of inception.</p><p>This means that security and compliance can be integrated as automated phases in Continuous Delivery pipelines, to run security compliance checks on every software release, and not slow down the software development lifecycle for developers and generate the necessary feedback loops.</p><p>So networking teams can learn from DevOps methodologies too much like development, operations, quality assurance, and security teams. These teams have utilized agile processes to improve their interaction with the software development process and benefit from using feedback loops.</p><p>How many times have network engineers had no choice but to delay a software release, as network changes need to be implemented and have been done so inefficiently using ticket-based systems that are not aligned with the processes other departments use? How many times have manually implemented network changes broken production services? This isn't a criticism of network teams or the ability of network engineers; it's the realization that the operational model needs to change and they can.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>This book will look at how networking changes can be made more efficient so as not to slow down the software development lifecycle. It will help outline strategies network engineers can adopt to automate network operations. We will focus on setting up network teams to succeed in an automation-driven environment, enabling the teams to work in a more collaborative fashion, and improve efficiency.</p><p>It will also show that network teams need to build new skills and learn configuration management tools such as Ansible to help them achieve this goal. The book will show the advantages that these tools bring, using the network modules they provide, and that they will help make automation easy and act as a self-starter guide.</p><p>We will focus on some of the cultural challenges that need to be overcome to influence and implement automation processes for network functions and convince network teams to make the most of networking APIs that are now provided by vendors can be trusted.</p><p>The book will discuss public and private clouds such as AWS and OpenStack, and ways they are used to provide networking to users. It will also discuss the emergence of software-defined networking solutions, such as Juniper Contrail, VMWare NSX, CISCO ACI, and focus on the Nokia Nuage VSP solution, which aims to make networking functions a self-service commodity.</p><p>The book will also highlight how continuous integration and delivery processes and deployment pipelines can be applied to govern network changes. It will also show ways that unit testing can be applied to automated network changes to integrate them with the software delivery lifecycle.</p><p>A detailed chapter overview for the book is detailed below:</p><p>
