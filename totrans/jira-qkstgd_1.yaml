    issue tracking tool by various teams in an organization. It's one of the most
    popular tools developed by Atlassian, which is the company behind it. Jira comes
    in three different flavors and, in this chapter, we'll also discuss the differences
    between these three flavors.

    issues, and manage project functions. There are many tools available on the market,
    but the best thing about Jira is that it can be easily customized and configured
    to suit the specific needs of an organisation and there are plenty of ways to
    add more features.

    also be customized to act like a help desk system, a simple test management suite,
    or a project management system with end-to-end traceability for software development
    projects.

- en: Jira has become one of the most popular tools in the industry, by not just software
    development teams but also by people who are working on support desk and business
    teams. Jira essentially is an issue tracking tool, where issue is a generic term
    for a ticket that could be a task, bug, story, epic in software development projects,
    a simple to-do in business projects, or an incident, problem, or service request
    in service desk-based projects. The popularity of Jira increased because of the
    fact that it can be customized very easily for a variety of use cases.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are lot of development methodologies in the industry that have become
    standard. These methodologies are used and adopted by many organizations. For
    instance, Agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban are one of the most widely
    used techniques but, let's be honest, irrespective of these standards, each company's
    way of working is different and there are many factors that changes the way a
    company works.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Scrum and Kanban methodologies provide a common framework and there are many
    tools that can help the easy adoption of these tools; however, a tool should be
    flexible enough to accommodate the needs of the team. A tool should adhere to
    standards but, at the same time, should be flexible enough to allow adjustments
    from the teams.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Difficulty in customization
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the methodologies that are adopted by teams for either development purposes
    or support are driven by a process, which is nothing but a life cycle with different
    stages. The most simple process can have just three stages, such as To do, In
    progress, and Done. When a new task is started it's usually waiting for someone
    to pick it up and when they have completed the task, they simple update the status
    of the task to Done.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now, in most cases, the complexity of the process is defined by the type of
    activity (task or bug), what information needs to be captured (summary, description,
    and so one) while planning the work, the life cycle or the workflow of the task,
    and tracking the work using reports. Standards, such as Scrum/Kanban (Agile) or
    ITSM (Service Desk), provide a framework but the teams trying to adopt these industry
    standards still need a way to tweak the tool based on their requirements. Maybe
    they need to ensure that users or developers attach a file when they resolve a
    task or they want to send a notification to the developer when the task is assigned
    to them.
  prefs: []

- en: Difficulty in adoption by teams
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tools are used to solve a problem, not to over-complicate it. A freelancer working
    on a laptop building code might not need to rely on a tool to help them; a small
    team of a few developers can develop code by keeping track of their activities
    in a spreadsheet; and a small help desk team receiving a couple of tickets once
    in a while can also use and manage their work using emails only.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, tools come into the picture when these teams need to improve their
    efficiency and aspire to become more productive. Any tool you use should be easy
    to adopt by all. It should be easy for the administrators to set up and implement,
    it should be easy for management to plan and track the work, and finally it should
    be easy for the developers to use.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As discussed previously, the adoption of the tool shouldn't be difficult and
    hence some effort is required to train the people involved in the usage of the
    tool. However, the training and how quickly the team can start using the tool
    are also very important and should be key criteria in choosing which tool you
    should be using.
  prefs: []

- en: Expensive
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The tools used in organizations provide lots of value and have obvious benefits;
    however, a tool should justify its cost and maintenance. A tool may be flexible,
    provides lots of customization, and is easy to use by everyone but if it's too
    expensive to implement and set up, then it will be difficult for an organization
    to justify the benefit.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are plenty of tools and application that are flexible but are either too
    difficult to customize or require lot of effort. Some tools are easy to customize
    but require lots of training and require special skill-sets. Jira tries to tackle
    these challenges by providing the right balance. Most of the customization can
    be done from the UI and that enables teams to quickly get started, while at the
    same time having peace of mind and confidence in the tool because a slight change
    in the process such as adding a new state in the workflow won't require a week.

    easy to get started with the tool. You can use various out-of-the-box templates
    to create a project. Irrespective of your team size, you always have this option
    to use an industry-standard tool. Even for a small team, the configurations that
    come with the out-of-the-box templates are well defined. Jira doesn't differentiate
    its features based on the team size; whether you're a small team or a big enterprise,
    the features that you get in the tool are the same. The way a small team of 10
    developers work on an Agile board will be the same as a big team of 50 developers
    working on multiple Agile boards.

    know for a fact that this number will increase to 35 or 40, then it's better to

    your productivity to increase. Not only is Jira a great tool for planning your
    activities or projects, but the day-to-day tracking is also very good in Jira.
    There are various ways through which your team is always up to date with the latest
    activities in the project. There are dashboards where everyone with the right
    access can see the information relevant to their team and themselves. Also, the
    tool has the capability to send notifications and reminders to users.

    if you're wondering whether you should be using Jira Core, Jira Software, or Jira
    Service Desk, then in this section we'll discuss how to choose which application
    is right for you.

    Methodologies supported by Jira Software: SCRUM83 and Kanban. Jira Software supports
    typical Agile concepts along with standard Agile-based reports. | Service desks
    and IT support desks helping customer issues. It can be used to implement ITSM
    or ITIL. Key features include: customer portal, integration with Confluence for
    self-service, SLAs, and queues. Jira Service Desk doesn''t put restrictions on
    the number of customers raising tickets. |'

- en: The best part is that all three applications can be used together. You can have
    one Jira instance in your organization where a few teams can have their projects
    running on Jira Core without any Agile boards, the development team can have their
    projects with Jira Software, and the service desk team can have their project
    running on Jira Service Desk.

    but these applications can be run on separate instances as well.

    need to sign up online and you can be up-and-running with your Jira instance within
    a few minutes. There's no installation required when using Cloud deployment. After
    signing up for Jira on the Cloud, just create your users. Your Jira instance can
    be accessed by a unique link that can be shared among your team.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is targeted at, and suitable for, big enterprise deployments of Jira. It's
    basically the Server version of Jira but installed on multiple nodes. The main
    benefits of Data Center deployment are high availability, disaster recovery, and
    scalability. This deployment is recommended if your organisation can't afford
    any downtime of Jira and it's mission-critical for your business.
