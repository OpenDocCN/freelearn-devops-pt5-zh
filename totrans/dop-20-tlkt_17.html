I'll break that tradition by not writing a summary. We went through so many practices and tools that summarizing them would require quite a big chapter. After all, if, at this point, you need a summary of what you learned, it would only mean that you didn't learn as much as I hoped. Consequently, I would feel that I failed, get depressed, and never write another book.</p><p>The book was never meant to be a comprehensive cookbook. I haven't explained everything you can do with Docker. Nor I showed you all the power behind Ansible. As a matter a fact, I haven't gone into great details with any of the tools. Such an approach would require dedication of a single book for each of them. The world is full of cookbooks. I wanted to write something different. I wanted to write a book that connects the dots between different practices and tools. I wanted to show you the logic behind some of the processes we applied. However, since I am a very hands-on type of person, my way of learning logic and processes involves a lot of practice and a lot of dedication. For that reason, the book is full of many hands-on examples. I thought that the best approach is to learn by doing. I hope I accomplished my goal. I hope I opened some doors that you might not have known existed, or you didn't know how to step through.</p><p>Let us not end the journey here. Let's continue in a more direct manner. Please use the Disqus channel <span class="emphasis"><em>The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit</em></span> if you'd like to discuss any aspect of the book. If you got stuck somewhere, if you failed to grasp something, or if you disagree with one of my views (or even all of them), just post it on the channel. I created it today while writing the final words. The problem is that nobody wants to be the first to post something in an empty place. I encourage you to be that first person. Others will benefit from our discussion and join in. If, on the other hand, you prefer a more one-on-one conversation, please send me an email to <code class="email">&lt;<a class="email" href="mailto:viktor@farcic.com">viktor@farcic.com</a>&gt;</code>, contact me through HangOuts or Skype (my username is <code class="literal">vfarcic</code>), or come to Barcelona and invite me for a beer.</p><p>If you would like to get notifications about book updates, please subscribe to the mailing list (<a class="ulink" href="http://technologyconversations.us13.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=a7c76fdff8ed9499bd43a66cf&amp;id=94858868c7">http://technologyconversations.us13.list-manage1.com/subscribe?u=a7c76fdff8ed9499bd43a66cf&amp;id=94858868c7</a>).</p><p>I will continue writing posts in my blog <a class="ulink" href="http://www.TechnologyConversations.com">www.TechnologyConversations.com</a> until, one day, I gather the courage to start writing a new book. Maybe it will be <span class="emphasis"><em>The DevOps 3.0 Toolkit</em></span>. Or, more likely, it will be something entirely different. Time will tell.</p><p>Keep learning, keep exploring, and keep improving the way you work. That is the only way to move forward in our line of business.</p><p>Good night, and good luck.</p><p>
