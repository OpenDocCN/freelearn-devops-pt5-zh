			<p>In this chapter, we will go through the fundamentals of implementing Jira Align to map the key objects and attributes. You will learn what is required to analyze an existing program in Jira Software and what it takes to translate the actual work into Jira Align. This chapter further elaborates on the dimensions of people, work, time, and outcomes, which are supported within your Jira Align and Jira Software toolset. Lastly, you will learn an approach to extend from program to portfolio and bridge strategy with execution.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Analyzing existing programs in Jira</li>
				<li>Mapping people, work, time, and outcomes</li>
				<li>Setting up Jira Align</li>
				<li>Connecting to Jira</li>
				<li>Extending to the portfolio</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>Analyzing existing programs in Jira</h1>
			<p>A key factor in the<a id="_idIndexMarker022"/> success of Jira Align is the quality of underlying data from Jira Software. As a part of the tool solution integration, you'll want to analyze the team-level data in Jira to determine whether it is scalable and connectable. If not, you'll want to standardize and optimize the data prior to integrating with Jira Align.</p>
			<p>We will now perform the following steps to start the health check of your data:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Download the Jet by Jira Align app from the Atlassian Marketplace, as shown in the following screenshot, available for Jira Cloud, Server, and Data Center hosting options. Ask your Jira administrator to install the app on your Jira instance:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.1_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Jet by Jira Align, Atlassian Marketplace"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – Jet by Jira Align, Atlassian Marketplace</p><p>Jet by Jira Align is a native Jira app built for analyzing the underlying health of your team data and<a id="_idIndexMarker023"/> practices in Jira. The app runs seven prioritized health checks and provides detailed insights by highlighting the areas requiring action to fix or improve the data. The more health checks that pass, the smoother your integration with Jira Align will be.</p></li>
				<li>Access the Jira wizard under <strong class="bold">Jira Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage apps</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Align</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jet</strong>. You will see the following start screen for the step-by-step wizard:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.2_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Jet by Jira Align, step-by-step wizard"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Jet by Jira Align, step-by-step wizard</p></li>
				<li>Once you get started, you<a id="_idIndexMarker024"/> can select up to 20 boards to analyze. A board typically represents one agile team. You may select multiple boards that belong to a single team of teams or program.<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p><p class="callout">A Scrum team will work off of a sprint tied to a Jira board and all Jira issues planned within a sprint will belong only to a single team. It is important that only one team works off of a Jira board. This principle applies to Kanban team boards as well.</p><p class="callout">When selecting multiple boards for analysis, it's best to select boards from the same project or that share the same field and issue type configurations. Selecting boards from different projects can cause field mapping discrepancies that skew results.</p><p class="callout">For Jira Cloud, next-gen boards are not officially supported. This is due to the unique field structure in next-gen. You could still analyze next-gen project boards by choosing to run each board individually.</p><p>Here's how the board <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>selection screen appears:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_2.3_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Jet by Jira Align, step 2 – select your team boards"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – Jet by Jira Align, step 2 – select your team boards</p></li>
				<li>Next, you will map<a id="_idIndexMarker026"/> the Jira fields and issue types to compare the Jira data structure against the seven health checks and analyze the health of the boards:<div><img src="img/Figure_2.4_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Jet by Jira Align, step 3 – map your configuration"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – Jet by Jira Align, step 3 – map your configuration</p><p>If you<a id="_idIndexMarker027"/> click on the <strong class="bold">Advanced Settings</strong> link, it will open<a id="_idIndexMarker028"/> the <strong class="bold">Advanced Settings</strong> screen, as follows:</p><div><img src="img/Figure_2.5_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Jet by Jira Align, step 3 – advanced settings"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – Jet by Jira Align, step 3 – advanced settings</p></li>
				<li>Analyze your boards and check the progress in terms of checks passed. When the board analysis is complete, you can view the <strong class="bold">Health Report</strong>. For the checks displaying <strong class="bold">Needs Work</strong>, follow the recommended action to improve the data and rerun the health check:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.6_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Jet by Jira Align, step 4 – health report analysis"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Jet by Jira Align, step 4 – health report analysis</p>
			<p>Let's now discuss<a id="_idIndexMarker029"/> the seven health checks, including their criticality on <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being the most critical, and recommended actions if <strong class="bold">Needs Work</strong> is displayed.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Health check #1: Stories should be linked to epics.</strong></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Criticality: 3</strong></p>
			<p>Stories with parent Jira epics represent how team-level work connects to strategic work. All team-level work should be traceable and reportable against a measurable goal. This check ensures that tactical execution in Jira can connect to strategy in Jira Align.</p>
			<p>You can simply treat it by linking orphan stories to parent Jira epics.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Health check #2: Stories should have estimated story points.</strong></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Criticality: 2</strong></p>
			<p>It is recommended that stories are estimated using story points to provide progress visibility in burndown charts and improve planning based on historical velocity (points per sprint). Ensuring that <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>all stories are estimated will improve your delivery predictability based on actual velocity.</p>
			<p>You can improve it by adding<a id="_idIndexMarker032"/> point estimates to your unestimated stories.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Health check #3: Epics should have an assigned fix version.</strong></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Criticality: 3</strong></p>
			<p>An assigned fix version for a Jira epic defines the release in which the feature will be shipped. The releases are tied to a project in Jira where the Jira epics are located. Fix versions are equivalent and map to release vehicles in Jira Align.</p>
			<p>You can fix it by assigning a fix version to all planned Jira epics.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Health check #4: There should only be one project assigned to a Jira board.</strong></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Criticality: 5</strong></p>
			<p>An agile board in Jira should represent a team. Having multiple projects linked to a single board can make it difficult to measure team-level progress. For example, you may struggle with multiple team sprints with overlapping dates.</p>
			<p>You can fix it by ensuring that only one project is linked to a board by navigating to <strong class="bold">Board Settings</strong>, selecting <strong class="bold">Edit Filter Shares</strong>, and removing all but one project. You may also fail this check if there are no projects associated with your board.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Health check #5: Mark custom fields as optional, not required.</strong></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Criticality: 5</strong></p>
			<p>Custom field configuration can affect your ability to integrate with Jira Align. Any Jira custom field that is set as mandatory will fail to sync between Jira and Jira Align.</p>
			<p>You can fix this by making your Jira issue custom fields optional.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Health check #6: A single sprint should only be tied to one board.</strong></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Criticality: 5</strong></p>
			<p>Because a board should only represent one team, if you have a sprint on multiple boards, it can be difficult to measure team-level progress.</p>
			<p>Similar to health check #4, follow the instructions to make sure you only have one project per board. If your team is structured such that you can't edit <strong class="bold">Filter Shares</strong>, instead select <strong class="bold">Edit Filter Query</strong> and ensure that only a single team's sprints are tied to a Jira board.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Health check #7: Sprints on a Jira board should not have overlapping dates.</strong></p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Criticality: 5</strong></p>
			<p>Sprints<a id="_idIndexMarker033"/> represent a (usually 2-week) planning and execution time slot for a single team. Only one sprint should be active at a time.</p>
			<p>You can improve it by making sure the start and end dates for your sprints don't overlap and that there is only one active sprint at a time.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">Health checks #1, #2, and #3 are great to have when scaling; however, they won't stop you from moving ahead with your Jira Align journey.</p>
			<p class="callout">Health checks #4, #5, #6, and #7 are very important to get right before connecting to Jira. The affected data will impact how work is visualized and synced into Jira Align.</p>
			<p class="callout">Health checks #6 and #7 do not apply to Kanban team boards. However, the Kanban teams should have an agreement to work on a common cadence aligned to sprints and a PI.</p>
			<p class="callout">To bring predictability and forecast insights into Jira Align, define a dataset and import only data completed within the last quarter, currently in progress, and future planned work.</p>
			<p>We have identified which data needs improving by analyzing existing programs in Jira. Let's now set the boundaries and map people, work, time, and outcomes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Mapping people, work, time, and outcomes</h1>
			<p>Jira Align provides a <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>holistic view of how people engage in work over periods of time in order to achieve outcomes. These four dimensions are key to planning and alignment and <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>play a significant role in business agility. While the teams continue their work in the best-of-breed Jira Software, Jira Align connects team-level execution <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>with top-level strategy.</p>
			<p>There are a number of ways in<a id="_idIndexMarker037"/> which team-level work can be organized in Jira. Keep in mind that a <em class="italic">project</em> in Jira represents a container for work items and is hence analogous to a backlog. Also note that there is not a <em class="italic">team</em> entity in Jira's database. Therefore, Jira Align will derive teams based on Jira project/board combinations. Here are the two top options for mapping projects/boards in Jira to teams in Jira Align:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>One Jira project per team of teams, one board per team, and one active sprint per board. This option requires a custom team field in Jira to drive each board. We recommend including Jira epics in the same project when using this option.</li>
				<li>One Jira project per team, one board per team, and one active sprint per board. For this option, you need an additional Jira project to contain Jira epics.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Which option should you choose? Either one project per team of teams or one project per team is acceptable. Let's now take a look at how to use one project per team of teams:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.7_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – One team of teams project structure"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – One team of teams project structure</p>
			<p>One project<a id="_idIndexMarker038"/> per team of teams requires the use of a custom field for teams in Jira to separate team boards. Jira issues don't store the board ID, and a single team selector field should be used to identify the team assignment for each story. The team field sets the board filter and prevents a sprint from being shared by multiple team boards in<a id="_idIndexMarker039"/> one Jira project. Teams can create additional boards and workflows for visualizations, but those won't be mapped to Jira Align. It's best to come up with a naming convention for the team boards that are connected to Jira Align. Larger <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>organizations tend to opt for one project per team of teams to reduce<a id="_idIndexMarker041"/> the number of projects in Jira. For example, if there are 20 portfolios, each with 10 programs, each with 10 teams, that would be 2,000 Jira projects.</p>
			<p>The smaller the company, the more it makes sense to go with the best practice of one project per team – it's simpler and doesn't require a team custom field. An organization can also use a combination of the approaches if need be. Here is the structure for one program project with many team projects:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.8_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – Many team projects structure"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Many team projects structure</p>
			<p>Note<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> that with this<a id="_idIndexMarker043"/> option, the program project should contain only Jira epics, which <a id="_idIndexMarker044"/>will get synced with Jira Align<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> features.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">Be sure to have only one active sprint per team agile board (teams can have future sprints planned without activating them).</p>
			<p class="callout">Avoid overlapping sprint dates and maintain a common sprint cadence between teams, a best practice for agile at scale.</p>
			<p class="callout">It's recommended for a story to be completed by one team in a single sprint. If a story needs to be shared, then clone it for each individual team.</p>
			<p class="callout">If there are any unfinished stories at the end of a sprint, split them or move them to the backlog before completing the sprint.</p>
			<p class="callout">For a Jira project with many team agile boards, do not share sprints across boards as this will create a conflict between boards.</p>
			<p class="callout">Avoid creating fake sprints as an extra holding sprint or backlog within the backlog. Jira Align will assume these are real planned future sprints.</p>
			<p>Now that we've got <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>containers for team-level work items in Jira, we return to the concept that people perform work over time to achieve outcomes. Team-level work is executed in Jira while Jira Align sits on top of Jira to connect execution with<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> strategy. Teams track work in Jira using the native issues and a hierarchy of Jira epics, stories, and sub-tasks. Jira epics represent a feature at the<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> program level that teams deliver within a program increment or business<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> quarter. Jira epics are broken down into stories, and further still into sub-tasks, to be delivered within a single sprint.</p>
			<p>At the portfolio level, you track<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> high-level work items called <em class="italic">themes</em> and <em class="italic">portfolio epics</em>, which are linked to your program-level work items, Jira epics or <em class="italic">features</em>. Organizations developing complex systems often require an additional work level between portfolio epics and<a id="_idIndexMarker051"/> features called <em class="italic">capabilities</em>. Introduce the additional level with caution as it adds extra levels of complexity that require added resources and measures to manage, maintain, and report at the capability level.</p>
			<p>At each level, work items contribute to measurable outcomes, roll up to parent work items, and ultimately connect to the enterprise strategy, as depicted in the following diagram. Notably, your toolset should support these practices at each level:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.9_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Tools with people, work, time, and outcomes"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Tools with people, work, time, and outcomes</p>
			<p>It is critical that the<a id="_idIndexMarker052"/> organization comes to a common agreement on how to <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>align tools with people, work, time, and outcomes <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>to successfully set up Jira Align. A key aspect of alignment is agreeing upon<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> terminology. Whether your organization adopts SAFe or not, we recommend referring to the SAFe glossary as a reference when <a id="_idIndexMarker056"/>defining your dimensions: <a href="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/glossary/">https://www.scaledagileframework.com/glossary/</a>.</p>
			<p>Note that the model shown in <em class="italic">Figure 2.9</em> also leads to <a href="B16328_03_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Navigating Jira Align</em>, where you will learn to load, visualize, and report upon work at various levels of scale.</p>
			<p>Let's get started and set up Jira Align by going through a quick fundamental setup and apply what we have discovered so far.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Setting up Jira Align</h1>
			<p>To get started <a id="_idIndexMarker057"/>with Jira Align, we will look at how to perform a quick setup using the information you discovered during the previous two phases: analyzing existing programs in Jira and mapping people, work, time, and outcomes. We will then onboard new users into Jira Align.</p>
			<p>As part of organizational alignment for transformation, it is important that everyone speaks a common language. As illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 1.1</em>, <em class="italic">Alignment toward transformation by connecting strategy with execution</em>, language helps an organization shape their culture by improving transparent communication flowing from leadership to the knowledge workers and vice versa. Experience has shown that it is important to keep the language as close to the common industry terminology or chosen framework as possible. This not only helps develop competencies internally, but also makes onboarding faster with effective communication when a new knowledge workforce joins an organization.</p>
			<p>As the organization<a id="_idIndexMarker058"/> matures in language, they start developing a shorthand form of communication that abbreviates useful principles and practices. This often creates a sense of togetherness and identity. When everyone speaks the same language, it feels cohesive and creates stronger relationships to bridge differences. The consistency in language has a positive ripple effect both inside and outside the organization, helping to build trust, reliability, and credibility. Overall, the alignment in language helps reduce misunderstandings and increases productivity.</p>
			<p>Jira Align is designed to adapt to your organization's transformation journey. You can rename the work objects, navigation menus, date labels, release attributes, currency, and finance terminologies in Jira Align to allow your organization to closely match your chosen practices and team tools. You can configure the platform terminology in Jira Align to match <a id="_idIndexMarker059"/>your framework, such as <strong class="bold">Large-Scale Scrum</strong> (<strong class="bold">LeSS</strong>), <strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>), and <strong class="bold">Disciplined Agile Delivery</strong> (<strong class="bold">DAD</strong>). For example, a <em class="italic">driver</em> in LeSS <a id="_idIndexMarker060"/>can be identified <a id="_idIndexMarker061"/>as a <em class="italic">business driver</em> in SAFe and a <em class="italic">goal</em> in DAD. Likewise, you may want to call your Jira epic a <em class="italic">feature</em>, your sprint an <em class="italic">iteration</em>, and so on.</p>
			<p>You can configure platform terminology under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform Terminology</strong>, and user record terminology under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong>| <strong class="bold">User Record Terminology</strong>. Once you update the terminologies, be sure to click on the <strong class="bold">Update Terminology</strong> button to save the changes and re-login to Jira Align for the updates to take effect. Here is the platform terminology setup screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.10_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – Jira Align platform terminology setup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – Jira Align platform terminology setup</p>
			<p>Once the terminologies<a id="_idIndexMarker062"/> are configured, we will start creating the entries for the physical and virtual organizational attributes in Jira Align. The physical attributes include the enterprise's organization structure and operational regions. Next, for the virtual organization, we will create a portfolio and associate multiple programs.</p>
			<p>You will first create the organization structure under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Setup </strong>| <strong class="bold">Organization Structure</strong> by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add New</strong> button, which presents the following screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.11_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – Jira Align organization structure setup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – Jira Align organization structure setup</p>
			<p>The organization structure<a id="_idIndexMarker063"/> allows you to represent your organizational business units and how they relate to one another.</p>
			<p>Next, we will create the physical regions in which your organization operates. This information is used when creating portfolios, programs, users, and releases for functionalities tied to time tracking in Jira Align. You can add regions under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Setup </strong>| <strong class="bold">Regions</strong> by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add Regions</strong> button to open the following screen:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.12_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – Jira Align regions setup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.12 – Jira Align regions setup</p>
			<p>We will now create the virtual organization attributes, beginning with the portfolio by going to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Setup</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolios</strong> and clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add Portfolio</strong> button. Creating a portfolio requires the following mandatory details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Mutants</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Mutants Portfolio</code> portfolio.</li>
				<li><code>Mutants Network</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Mutants Portfolio Leadership Team</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Europe</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These settings are shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.13_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13 – Jira Align portfolio setup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13 – Jira Align portfolio setup</p>
			<p>Once you have completed the required details, click on <strong class="bold">Save</strong>. You can now add the individual portfolio leadership team members under the <strong class="bold">Members</strong> tab.</p>
			<p>Next, we will create the <a id="_idIndexMarker065"/>programs and link them to the portfolio by going to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Setup </strong>| <strong class="bold">Programs</strong> and clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add Program</strong> button. Creating a program requires the following mandatory details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Superheroes</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Mutants</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Superheroes Program Leadership Team</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you complete the required details, click on <strong class="bold">Save</strong>. You can now add the individual program leadership team <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>members under the <strong class="bold">Members</strong> tab. When you need to run more than one program, you can repeat the steps to create and associate multiple programs with the portfolio. For example, we have created and associated the <strong class="bold">Transformers</strong> program and the <strong class="bold">Superheroes</strong> program:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.14_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.14 – Jira Align program setup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.14 – Jira Align program setup</p>
			<p>You may create and manage additional attributes, such as customers, cost centers, countries, cities, and custom hierarchies under the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Setup</strong> menu to further define your views and reporting in Jira Align.</p>
			<p>We will next create teams and associate them with the program. The teams will be created by going to <strong class="bold">Team</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Teams</strong> and clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add Team</strong> button. Creating a team requires the following mandatory details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Type</strong>: Choose <strong class="bold">Agile Team</strong> for creating a Scrum team and <strong class="bold">Kanban Team</strong> for a Kanban team. Let's create an agile team for the Superheroes program.</li>
				<li><code>Team Batman</code>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: Add a description for your team.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team Short Name</strong>: Add a five-character short name.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sprint Prefix</strong>: Add a team prefix to your team sprints.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Program</strong>: Choose the <a id="_idIndexMarker067"/>program that your team belongs to.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you have completed the required details, click on <strong class="bold">Save</strong>. You can now add the team photo under the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> tab and individual team members under the <strong class="bold">Members</strong> tab:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.15_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.15 – Jira Align team setup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.15 – Jira Align team setup</p>
			<p>You will repeat these configuration<a id="_idIndexMarker068"/> steps to create your virtual structure and then use the <strong class="bold">Configuration</strong> bar to navigate the virtual organization:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.16_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.16 – Jira Align virtual organizational structure"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16 – Jira Align virtual organizational structure</p>
			<p>Finally, we will create a <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>program increment cadence and the related anchor sprints in Jira Align as preparations to connect to Jira. The program increment will be created by going to <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Program Increments</strong> and clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add Program Increment</strong> button. Creating a program increment requires the following mandatory details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Mutants</code> portfolio.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Program</strong>: Choose all the programs that will share the program increment cadence <em class="italic">Superheroes and Transformers</em>.</li>
				<li><code>2020 Q4</code>.</li>
				<li><code>2020 Q4</code>.</li>
				<li><code>20Q4</code>. This will be used for reporting purposes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start Date</strong>: Add a start date to your program increment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Finish Date</strong>: Add a finish date to your program increment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: Add a description to your program increment.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Status</strong>: Choose a status<a id="_idIndexMarker070"/> to track your program increment. The available statuses are <strong class="bold">Planning</strong>, <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong>, <strong class="bold">Done</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Archive</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once you complete the required details, click on <strong class="bold">Save</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.17_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.17 – Jira Align program increment setup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17 – Jira Align program increment setup</p>
			<p>If your programs do not share a common program increment, then repeat the preceding steps and ensure that you add a prefix to your program increment number, name, and short name to uniquely identify the other program increment cadences.</p>
			<p>We can now create anchor sprints for the program increment. For this, choose the <strong class="bold">SYNC SPRINTS</strong> tab under the selected program increment. You can mass add anchor sprints that follow a common sprint cadence or you can add a single anchor sprint that can represent your <strong class="bold">IP (Innovation and Planning)</strong> sprint.</p>
			<p>To mass add<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> anchor sprints, select the <strong class="bold">Mass Add</strong> toggle and provide the following details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Q4S</code>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">First Date</strong>: Add the first sprint start date.</li>

			<p>In addition to the preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>details, once you connect to Jira, there will be Jira-integrated users who will obtain access to Jira Align. Let's now connect Jira Align to Jira and start mapping the objects and fields with Jira.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>Connecting to Jira</h1>
			<p>In Jira Align, you<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> will create and manage portfolio and program backlogs while agile teams continue to work in Jira Software with zero to minimal disruption. Jira Align connects to one or many Jira instances and the connector supports all three Jira hosting platforms: Atlassian Cloud, Server, and Data Center. Jira Align is a SaaS first solution with enterprise-grade hosting. A Jira Align on-premises solution is available for organizations that require additional controls in terms of their data security and privacy. The following diagram represents how the Jira Align platform connects to one or many Jira platforms:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.23_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.23 – Jira connector hosting platforms"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.23 – Jira connector hosting platforms</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">Jira Align on-premises has<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> the same code base as Jira Align SaaS and supports integration with the Atlassian Cloud Jira Software. If you chose to deploy Jira Align on-premises, you are most likely to integrate with Jira Software Data Center, as illustrated in <em class="italic">Figure 2.23</em>.</p>
			<p>For physically connecting to Jira Software, it is required to establish a permanent application link between Jira and Jira Align via the Jira Connector. To establish the connection, you will need a Jira<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> service account with permission to access the data in Jira.</p>
			<p>You will first create and configure an application link in Jira Software by going to <code>Jira Align</code>, and application type, <code>Generic Application</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.24_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.24 – Jira application link"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.24 – Jira application link</p>
			<p>Now switch to Jira Align, go to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Settings</strong>, and click on the <strong class="bold">Jira Connectors</strong> button. Add a connector and then complete the following details for the connection before you click on the <strong class="bold">Active</strong> button. This will prompt you to enter the Jira service user login details for the Jira connector to access Jira via the API:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.25_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.25 – Jira Align, manage Jira connectors"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.25 – Jira Align, manage Jira connectors</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Here are the technical prerequisites for integration:</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Jira instance accessibility</strong>: The Jira<a id="_idIndexMarker081"/> instance should be accessible to Jira Align via the internet or the <strong class="bold">virtual private network</strong> (<strong class="bold">VPN</strong>).</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Jira instance with secure access</strong>: The Jira instance<a id="_idIndexMarker082"/> should have a publicly trusted <strong class="bold">SSL</strong> (<strong class="bold">secure socket layer</strong>) certificate for secure <strong class="bold">HTTPS</strong> (<strong class="bold">hypertext transfer protocol secure</strong>) access.</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Jira user access</strong>: You will need a dedicated Jira <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>service user provisioned with the following project permissions: Create Issues, Edit Issues, Assign Issues, Manage Sprints, Browse, and Manage Reporter.</p>
			<p>The Jira connector requires access to the Jira API, which should be exposed outside the firewall to access from the Jira Align application. If your Jira is hosted in the Atlassian Cloud, then it is pretty straightforward connecting to the Jira API. If your Jira is hosted on-premises, then your Jira most probably sits behind a firewall, and enabling external access to the Jira API and integrating to Jira becomes a challenge to address. The following <a id="_idIndexMarker084"/>diagram represents how the Jira API should be exposed and accessible to the Jira connector in Jira Align:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.26_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.26 – Jira Connector API access and connectivity"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.26 – Jira Connector API access and connectivity</p>
			<p>You may achieve this by one or a combination of three options after Jira has been configured:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Opening firewall ports/whitelisting</li>
				<li>Reverse proxy and/or API gateway</li>
				<li>On-premises agent</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Due to an organization's<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> network policies, complex infrastructure, and security requirements, you may need to involve various technical roles, including Edge Network Security, Sysadmin, Jira Admin, Network Admin, and IT C-suite executives, to successfully enable and allow the Jira API access to the Jira connector. These are the four API-based URLs that the Jira connector requires:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>/rest/auth/</code></li>
				<li><code>/rest/api/2/</code></li>
				<li><code>/rest/agile/1.0/</code></li>
				<li><code>/rest/greenhopper/1.0/</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The verbs needed for each of these are as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>GET /rest/**</code></li>
				<li><code>POST /rest/**</code></li>
				<li><code>DELETE /rest/**</code></li>
				<li><code>PUT /rest/**</code></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here, /rest/** should be replaced with the endpoints listed previously, for example /rest/auth.</p>
			<p>Once the connection is established, we<a id="_idIndexMarker086"/> will start connecting the Jira artifacts. The following image based on the 10X: Jira Integration Guide document details how Jira and Jira Align artifacts are mapped and synced via the Jira API connector:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.27_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.27 - Jira Align Jira integration mapping, adapted from 10X: Jira Integration Guide"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.27 - Jira Align Jira integration mapping, adapted from 10X: Jira Integration Guide</p>
			<p>You can access the Jira Integration <a id="_idIndexMarker087"/>Guide by going to the user menu, selecting <strong class="bold">Help</strong> | <strong class="bold">Quick Links</strong> | <strong class="bold">Guides,</strong> and then clicking on <strong class="bold">10X: Jira Integration Guide</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">It is important to understand the core data mapping between Jira Align and Jira Software projects, boards, work item types, and fields.</p>
			<p class="callout">Atlassian provides templates for Jira Integration Data Collection to facilitate data mapping during preliminary requirements gathering. You can download the templates by going to the user menu, selecting <strong class="bold">Help</strong> | <strong class="bold">Knowledge Base</strong> | <strong class="bold">Integrations</strong> | <strong class="bold">10X: Jira Integration Guide,</strong> and then clicking on <strong class="bold">10X: Jira Integration Data Collection</strong>.</p>
			<p>In addition to the field <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>mappings required as discussed earlier, there are some recommended optional Jira Align field mappings between Jira epics and Jira Align features. You can configure them under the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Connectors</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Setup</strong> tab and look for the <strong class="bold">Custom Fields</strong> section. Next, you will enter your custom field ID in the following format: <strong class="bold">customfield_100xx</strong>, where <em class="italic">100xx</em> is the ID located in Jira Software. Keep in mind that these will require you to create custom fields in Jira Software as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">MMF</strong> (<strong class="bold">Minimum Marketable Feature</strong>): A <strong class="bold">Yes/No</strong> field that syncs bi-directionally to indicate whether<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> the feature represents the<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> minimum marketable functionality</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature Product</strong>: A single selection drop-down field that syncs bi-directionally to display the product with which a feature is associated</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Why? Details</strong>: A multiline text field that syncs one way (Jira Align to Jira) to display details on why a work item is in the backlog and how it connects to strategic objectives</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Feature Parent</strong>: A single selection drop-down field that syncs one way (Jira Align to Jira) to display the parent work item (capability or portfolio epic) of the feature</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Program increment</strong>: A single selection drop-down field that syncs one way (Jira Align to Jira) to display the <a id="_idIndexMarker091"/>program increment or business quarter in which the feature will be delivered<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p><p class="callout">The <strong class="bold">Jira Align Why? definition</strong>, a custom text (multiline) field, should be created in Jira Software and added to the applicable Jira epic issue screen. Next, the custom field should be configured as a <strong class="bold">Wiki style renderer</strong> in the Jira field configuration. This configuration would allow the <strong class="bold">Why?</strong> button data to be presented in a wiki-formatted table.</p><p class="callout">The data syncs one way, from Jira Align to Jira Software. We recommend that the Jira Align Why? definition custom field is set as read-only, or any changes made in the custom field will be overwritten upon the next sync with Jira Align.</p><p class="callout">In addition, any required custom fields in Jira Software should be set as optional in order for the custom fields to successfully sync with Jira Align.</p><p class="callout">If you use Rich Text Format in Jira fields to be integrated with Jira Align, go to the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Connections</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Setup</strong> tab and choose <strong class="bold">HTML</strong> as the option for <strong class="bold">Rich Text Format</strong>.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>We saw how Jira issue types (epics, stories, and bugs) map to Jira Align work items (features, stories, and defects). Note, too, that Jira sub-tasks map to Jira Align tasks and that Jira tasks can be mapped to a Jira Align story of <em class="italic">type = task</em>. But what about the status of these Jira issue types? Jira workflows are comprised of the statuses and transitions that issues move through as part of the development life cycle. These workflows are connected to Jira Align via a mapping of Jira statuses to Jira Align states (forward mapping) and of Jira Align states to Jira statuses (reverse mapping). Note that ideally, all workflows connected to Jira Align are consistent to make administration easier, but whatever workflows are agreed upon must not be altered without coordination with the Jira Align administrator.</p>
			<p>Let's now configure the forward state mapping between Jira and Jira Align. You can configure the state mapping under the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Connectors</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">State Mapping</strong> tab. The forward state mapping is a global setting and can be configured for the following work items: features (Jira epics), stories, tasks (Jira sub-tasks), and defects (Jira bugs). You will need to set the Jira Canceled State ID to allow any issues canceled in Jira to <a id="_idIndexMarker092"/>move to the canceled recycle bin in Jira Align. Any canceled work item in Jira Align will set the issues in Jira to the canceled state. The following screen shows how to configure the forward state mapping in Jira Align:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.28_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.28 – Jira Align forward state mapping"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.28 – Jira Align forward state mapping</p>
			<p>Next, we will set the reverse<a id="_idIndexMarker093"/> state mapping between Jira Align and Jira. For this you will first need to manage Jira projects under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Connectors</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage Projects</strong>. To add a new Jira project, click on the <strong class="bold">Add Project</strong> button and provide the project key, project name, choose the associated program, and then click on <strong class="bold">Save</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.29_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.29 – Jira Align manage projects"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.29 – Jira Align manage projects</p>
			<p>The reverse state mapping is<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> available for each Jira project for the following work items: features (Jira epics), stories, and defects (Jira bugs). You will need to click on the <strong class="bold">State Mapping</strong> link for each Jira project to configure the reverse state mapping. The following screen shows how to configure the reverse state mapping for a chosen Jira project in Jira Align:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.30_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.30 – Jira Align reverse state mapping"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.30 – Jira Align reverse state mapping</p>
			<p>Once the mapping is configured, you can click on <strong class="bold">Update</strong> to save it to the project or click on the <strong class="bold">Update all Jira Projects</strong> button to apply the reverse state mapping to all available Jira projects in Jira Align.</p>
			<p>Next, you will configure <a id="_idIndexMarker095"/>the field mappings for each Jira project by going to the <strong class="bold">Manage Projects</strong> tab and clicking on the <strong class="bold">Manage Custom Fields</strong> button. Here you will configure the Jira custom field mappings: Jira Team and Team values, Jira Link Actions, Jira Product, Jira MMF, and Jira Priority field values, as shown:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.31_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.31 – Jira Align reverse custom field mapping"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.31 – Jira Align reverse custom field mapping</p>
			<p>Now that fields and states<a id="_idIndexMarker096"/> are mapped, let's see how to audit changes and orphan records. You can report on Jira issues that Jira Align no longer has access to via the API. These issues are known as orphans and you can report on them under the <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Connectors</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Management</strong> | <strong class="bold">Jira Deleted Issue</strong> tab. The resulting orphan Jira issues report lists two types of missing issues:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Any Jira Align-linked Jira issues that were permanently deleted by a user in Jira. The issues are displayed with a red warning icon.</li>
				<li>Any Jira issues that had their parent project permission changed such that the Jira service account no longer has access to the issue.<p class="callout-heading">Tips and Tricks</p><p class="callout">Note that the report also displays API parsing errors via a yellow icon, which can be ignored or filtered out using the error types, as the issues still exist in Jira.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is recommended to run this report once a week and schedule the run during non-working hours to prevent any interruptions to the regular syncing of data.</p>
			<p>Next, let's see how to view an audit log. Simply go to the <strong class="bold">Manage Projects</strong> tab and click on the <strong class="bold">View Logs</strong> button to view audit logs on the Jira synchronization process. The log captures changes to <a id="_idIndexMarker097"/>the data regarding managing projects, Jira setup, custom issue types, Jira integration, pulling Jira user data, and state mappings. You can filter the Jira log report according to the following items: Configuration, Jira API, Issues, Sprints, and Release Vehicles. You can filter the configuration data further by date, and it serves as a change log if you need to track who changed what and when on the Jira Connector configurations.</p>
			<p>Now that you have connected to Jira, let's explore how to connect tactical execution in Jira to strategy in Jira Align by extending to the portfolio.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Extending to the portfolio</h1>
			<p>A portfolio is<a id="_idIndexMarker098"/> more than a collection of programs. It is the unit responsible for linking strategy to execution. The portfolio team translates mission and vision into strategic themes and lightweight business cases for epics through which the themes are realized. But extending Jira Align to the portfolio level traditionally comes later in an enterprise implementation after several successful programs are up and running.</p>
			<p>For years, the Jira Align implementation roadmap has closely followed that of the leading framework it supports, SAFe, beginning with the establishment of the core leadership team who are not only bought in, but drive the transformation day to day. From there, programs (teams of teams) are identified, trained, and onboarded in Jira Align where they refine their backlogs and prepare for quarterly planning (PI planning if following SAFe). They leverage Jira Align's powerful Product Roadmaps, Program Room, Program Board, Dependency Maps, Risk ROAM report, and so on, to execute their quarterly increment. Then, building on the success of the first launched program, the guiding group engages in a <em class="italic">rinse and repeat</em> for the next program, and so on. One of our successful clients launched seven programs this way in the course of a year, realizing 33% faster time-to-market in year 1, 37% in year 2, and 45% in year 3.</p>
			<p>Program-level success, where teams of teams deliver features to market faster, with higher quality and higher value has traditionally been the sweet spot of both scaling frameworks and tools that support them. For this reason, extending program-level success to the portfolio has come later, after launching several programs. However, there is a more recent trend to establish the portfolio level in Jira Align early on and connect it with program-level execution concurrent with launching the first few programs.</p>
			<p>Using this approach, portfolio leadership may be onboarded in Jira Align prior to the first programs and begin creating high-level work items: themes that may span years and portfolio epics that span business quarters. They may also create high-level goals, such as annual OKRs that will be<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> realized through the work of programs as they are onboarded. A portfolio-level funnel can be created in Jira Align using process steps visualized on a Kanban for leadership to track the state of epics from concept through to delivery. This is done as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.32_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.32 – Portfolio-level epic funnel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.32 – Portfolio-level epic funnel</p>
			<p>The portfolio team can periodically prioritize epics using <strong class="bold">Weighted Shortest Job First</strong> (<strong class="bold">WSJF</strong>), which Jira Align calculates <a id="_idIndexMarker100"/>after you enter a score for the four parameters: Business Value, Time Value, Risk Reduction/Opportunity Enablement Value, and Job Size. The following screenshot shows the WSJF parameters used to calculate the score:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.33_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.33 – Calculated WSJF based on parameter scores"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.33 – Calculated WSJF based on parameter scores</p>
			<p>The following screenshot shows the portfolio epic backlog ranked by WSJF:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.34_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.34 – Portfolio epic backlog ranked by WSJF"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.34 – Portfolio epic backlog ranked by WSJF</p>
			<p>The portfolio team can also use Jira Align's Value Engineering functionality to determine whether work items are worth building, and later, based on collected metrics, whether to pivot or persevere<a id="_idIndexMarker101"/> based on the <em class="italic">build-measure-learn</em> approach popularized by Eric Ries in <em class="italic">The Lean Startup</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.35_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.35 – Value engineering data shown on the epic details panel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.35 – Value engineering data shown on the epic details panel</p>
			<p>The rise in popularity of establishing the portfolio in Jira Align earlier in the implementation makes sense as organizations wish to connect strategy with execution, from themes to portfolio epics to features, to stories and tasks. Referring again to <em class="italic">Figure 1.1</em>, the sooner you connect strategy with execution, the sooner you achieve the ripple effect leading from alignment to business transformation. Once the levels are connected in Jira Align, the organization has visibility into key financial reports, such as investment by theme and investment versus actuals, as well as real-time status from live product roadmaps and progress bars for work item rollups in the work tree.</p>
			<p>There are, however, considerations as to whether an organization is ready to extend Jira Align to the portfolio. Those who achieve the greatest success at the portfolio level adopt the practices discussed in the following sections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Establishing a portfolio vision and roadmap</h2>
			<p>You cannot connect <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>execution with strategy if the latter is ill-defined. Jira Align provides canvas templates to help the portfolio team define its vision statement <a id="_idIndexMarker103"/>and value proposition. The following screenshot shows a template for the portfolio vision canvas:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.36_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 2.36 – Portfolio canvas template"/>

			<p>In agile budgeting, you fund <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>persistent teams and bring the work to them, as opposed to traditional budgeting, where you fund projects and assemble teams to deliver them. If following SAFe, you will have value stream budgets that remain fixed each quarter and adjust the allocation of funding across value streams about twice a year. The persistent teams then develop work items to deliver upon these value streams. Each quarter, work is funneled to the teams who break down higher-level work items into features that can be delivered within the quarter and stories that can be delivered within sprints. The group of sprints comprising the quarter, usually five or six of them, is called a Program Increment in SAFe, but whether following SAFe or not, the practice remains generally the same when operating at scale.</p>
			<p>An important aspect of agile budgeting is that it relies on the average cost of a story point based on a blended rate. The financial reports in Jira Align, such as the investment by theme and investment versus actuals reports, rely on this approach. Organizations that leverage this approach have found it to be lighter and less burdensome than traditional budgeting and have even<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> obtained <strong class="bold">capital expense</strong> (<strong class="bold">CapEx</strong>) and <strong class="bold">operating expense</strong> (<strong class="bold">OpEx</strong>) costs<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> in this manner. However, while the average point cost approach often closely matches other methods, it is important to note that Jira Align is not meant to be the organization's financial system of record.</p>
			<p>The rise in interest in <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>establishing the portfolio level early in a Jira Align implementation also coincides with the launch of SAFe's Lean Portfolio Management certification in Fall 2019. More and more organizations are moving toward funding and managing value streams. Indeed, 78% of respondents to the 14th Annual State of Agile survey stated that their organization has implemented, is implementing, or has expressed interest in, approaches focused on value streams.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Connecting the enterprise</h2>
			<p>In this modern software <a id="_idIndexMarker108"/>and digital age, you will find that most organizations are starting, or have started, their transformation journey. But those achieving the best outcomes have taught us that business and technology teams alike need to be connected, aligned, and stay in sync. Attaining business agility requires connecting the entire enterprise.</p>
			<p>It is important that your non-technical teams, such as HR, procurement, compliance, and finance, embrace and understand the value of agile to propel an organization forward in achieving goals such as accelerating the time to market. Any and all functions of the business required to deliver value to customers must be onboard and engaged at the right levels to keep the flow of value delivery consistent and unblocked. When the entire enterprise knows the product roadmap and required support for the teams (staffing, tooling, security reviews, and suchlike), organizational silos are reduced while business agility increases.</p>
			<p>If you are yet to extend your team-level execution to the portfolio, then you may face challenges regarding transparency, consistency, and predictability. The best way to bridge this gap is for teams at all levels to gain visibility to work, measure outcomes, and continually optimize investments to maximize value – in short, get them onboarded and acquainted with Jira Align. We'll now help you get oriented with the tool, beginning with basic navigation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we discussed the fundamentals of implementing Jira Align. We learned the importance of analyzing existing programs, aligning the organizational language, and mapping people, work, time, and outcomes. We then looked at a quick setup to connect team-level execution in Jira with programs and strategy in Jira Align. Lastly, we covered the importance of extending to the portfolio sooner rather than later when implementing Jira Align.</p>
			<p>Now you know how to analyze the underlying data and prepare Jira Software for Jira Align. You know the technical requirements to set up and connect Jira Align with Jira. Lastly, you've seen three proven practices on how to extend agile practices to the portfolio level.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we move beyond implementation to the actual use of Jira Align, beginning with the basics of navigation.</p>
