- en: DevOps is not a tool, technology, process, or framework; DevOps is a culture.
    Culture is an organization-specific thing and it evolves with a combination of
    people, processes, and tools for continuous improvement with continuous innovations.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The price of doing the same thing over and over again is far higher than the
    price of change. Change is no threat to an organization's culture. Using disruptive
    innovations only improves the culture. To improve is to change in the right direction,
    and to be perfect is to change often in the right direction by learning from the
    mistakes or experiences. And just for some fun... "Change is inevitable—even from
    a vending machine nowadays."

- en: DevOps is not about reaching a destination and enjoying the beauty of it and
    ending the tour. It is a never-ending process of continuous improvement where
    we innovate things and plan to reach the same destination by enjoying the journey
    or process. This process may differ each time we improve and innovate, but our
    goal doesn't change! The goal is to achieve faster time to market with best utilization
    of resources in a cost-effective manner with the highest customer satisfaction.

- en: This book emphasizes not only the technology but also different practices that
    the DevOps culture should include. DevOps is in its early stage. Deciding what
    not to do is very important, when, as an organization, we go in the direction
    of improvements and innovations. It is important to decide not to do manual work
    when it is repetitive.

- en: In this book, we will cover all the key practices of DevOps, such as continuous
    integration, resource provisioning using containers and cloud computing – IaaS
    (Amazon EC2 and Microsoft Azure virtual machines), and PaaS (Azure App Service
    or Azure Web Apps and Amazon Elastic Beanstalk), continuous delivery, continuous
    testing, and continuous deployment; how to automate build integration and provision
    resources in the cloud environment; deploying a web application into Amazon Elastic
    Beanstalk, Microsoft Azure Web Apps/App Service Environments; application monitoring
    in AWS and Microsoft Azure Public Cloud; and load testing in VSTS and Apache JMeter.

- en: The main objective is to manage the application life cycle. By automating repetitive
    manual processes, we standardize the management of the application life cycle
    and avoid errors. We also provide governance to application life cycle management
    by providing approval-based application deployment to different environments in
    Jenkins and VSTS, both with plugins or out-of-the-box features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For continuous integration and continuous release (continuous delivery and continuous
    deployment), we have used Jenkins and Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS). The
    orchestration of end-to-end automation and approval-based workflows is managed
    by Jenkins and VSTS.

- en: Progress is impossible without a change in mindset, and in order to change anything
    we need to visualize the change. In this book, we will try to focus on the cultural
    journey in the land of DevOps using people (development team, QA team, operations
    team, cloud team, build engineers, infrastructure team, and so on), processes
    (continuous integration, automated resource provisioning, continuous delivery,
    continuous testing, continuous deployment, continuous monitoring, continuous improvement,
    and continuous innovation), and tools (open source and the Microsoft stack).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The main reasons to showcase processes or practices using open source and the
    Microsoft stack is to cultivate the feeling that it is not about tools; it is
    about the mindset! We can perform almost the same operations using any automation
    tools.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book assumes that you are familiar with at least the Java programming language.
    Knowledge of core Java and JEE is essential if you want to gain better insights
    from this book. Having a strong understanding of the deployment of a web application
    in application servers such as Tomcat will help you to understand the flow quickly.
    However, we have quickly provided an overview of it. As the application development
    life cycle will cover a lot of tools in general, it is essential to have some
    knowledge of code repositories, as well as IDE tools such as Eclipse, and build
    tools such as Ant and Maven.
  prefs: []

- en: Knowledge of code analysis tools will make your job easier in configuration
    and integration; however, it is not vital to perform the exercises given in the
    book. Most of the configuration steps are mentioned clearly, step by step, and
    by providing screenshots for clear visualization.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book is aimed at IT developers and operations, administrators who want to
    quickly learn and implement the DevOps culture in their organization. This book
    is specially aimed at developers, technical leads, testers, and operational professionals,
    who are the target readers and will want to jumpstart containers, the Chef configuration
    management tool, Microsoft Azure PaaS, and offerings such as app services and
    SQL database to host applications. Readers are aware of the issues faced by development
    and operations teams as they are stakeholders in the application life cycle management
    process. The reason to jumpstart Jenkins Automation Server, Microsoft Azure PaaS,
    and VSTS is to understand the importance of their contribution to continuous integration,
    automated test case execution, and continuous delivery for effective application
    life cycle management.

    continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. You may be a novice or be experienced
    with continuous integration tools such as Jenkins. This book covers continuous
    integration, cloud computing, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment for
    a sample Java Spring-based application. The main objective is to see end-to-end
    automation and implement it on the open source and Microsoft technology stack
    that can be extended further based on the understanding gained from this book.
