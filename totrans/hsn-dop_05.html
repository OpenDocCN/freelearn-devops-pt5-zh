<p>Cloud technologies encompass a wide umbrella of multiple service offerings and underlying technologies, as depicted in the following diagram:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="272" src="assets/15608fd1-d90a-44bb-b48c-d9c9e2e02c20.png" width="594"/></div>
<p>The increasing popularity of cloud computing has resulted in its wide adoption across industries such as banking, insurance, hi-tech, pharmacy, manufacturing, and so on. Big data systems ingest huge volumes of data from multiple source systems with variety of formats. Therefore, its quite economical to stage or store data on cloud compared to on-premise systems.</p>
<p>Even with Internet of Things, sensor data from machines runs into terabytes and petabytes quickly, therefore only cloud systems are economical to hold such data volumes. With strategic and systematic adoption of business processes, applications, platforms, and infrastructures, businesses can accrue the following multiple benefits:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dynamic load patterns and elastic scalability</strong>: A well-known application of the cloud is where the workload is varying and unpredictable. In such scenarios, clients scale your IT capacity by off loading high-demand compute requirements to the cloud without provisioning for peak-load capacity, thus saving money for the organization.</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="109" src="assets/5e76d8ec-0d20-4800-9511-3258599dff2d.png" width="337"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Quick setup</strong>: The capacity sizing and procurement time for the resources is drastically reduced multifold, so with cloud setup, application deployments are relatively easier and faster; allowing for the offloading of basic IT requirements to the cloud service providers.</li>
<li><strong>Pay as you go</strong>: Pay for what you need and use. The big advantage is in saving the effort and cost for many of the products used to support the network and systems, such as spam/antivirus, encryption, data archiving, email services, and off-site storage.</li>
<li><strong>Higher value</strong>: The administrative activities for the IT support systems move to the cloud service provider so internal IT resources can focus on higher-value business activities, and capital expenditure can be directed for more pressing business investments.</li>
</ul>
<p>The adoptions for cloud are across the following layers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Business process</li>
<li>Application</li>
<li>Platform</li>
<li>Infrastructure</li>
</ul>
<p>We will discuss these in detail in the coming sections. They are also represented in the following diagram:</p>

<p>Virtualization is one important technology often referred to alongside cloud technologies. It is the prime technology framework associated with cloud computing to create various dedicated execution environments sharing the same physical infrastructures, such as an operating system, server, storage device, or network. Virtualization software manipulates hardware, while cloud computing refers to the service, and delivers the value of shared computing resources software or data as a composite service.</p>
<p>Virtualization is creating a virtual machine over bare metal, or an existing operating system with hypervisor.</p>
<p>There are a few models, such as Oracle VM, Sun xVM Server, LynSecure, and VirtualLogicVLX, that have hypervisor running on a bare system without an operating system:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="258" src="assets/cd446ce0-631e-4c26-bf60-711e06279aa3.png" width="238"/></div>
<p>Another category involves having hypervisor software on top of an existing operating system. A few examples are VMWare Fusion, Virtual Server 2005 R2, Containers, Microsoft Hyper V, Windows Virtual PC, and VMWare workstation 6.0:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="272" src="assets/55fce0cd-6980-4022-8f75-7bcfbf9b8574.png" width="233"/></div>
<p><strong>Virtual Machine Monitor </strong>(<strong>VMM</strong>) or virtual manager, is technology to create virtual versions of a device or resource to run multiple applications on multiple divergent operating systems on the same server simultaneously. DevOps ensures the configuration is consistent between environments like development, QA, pre-prod and production. The usage of virtual machines on cloud and their replication consistently with DevOps is effective mode to quickly turn around. A hypervisor or VMM installed on top of the operating system makes servers, workstations, storage, and other systems independent of the physical hardware layer. A <strong>virtual machine</strong> (<strong>VM</strong>) is an emulation of a computer system based on architectures, and provides the specialized functionality. A host machine is a computer on which a hypervisor runs one or more virtual machines, and each virtual machine is called a <strong>guest machine</strong>.</p>
<p>Virtualization offers many benefits, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximizing resources</strong>: Traditionally built systems are mostly underutilized. Virtualization can reduce the number of physical systems to acquire by efficiently using the capacity. Virtualization helps to maximize the use of the hardware investment to get more value out of the servers.</li>
<li><strong>Multiple systems</strong>: These can help you run multiple types of applications and even run different operating systems for those applications on the same physical hardware, such as Linux and Windows, on the same server and deploy the respective applications.</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtualization can be full virtualization or para-virtualization.</p>
<p><strong>Full virtualization</strong> is where the server with all the software is emulated to another system. It's more applicable in scenarios such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing a computer system among multiple users</li>
<li>Isolating users from each other and the control programs</li>
<li>Emulating a server system to clients or host systems</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Para-virtualization</strong> allows for multiple OS to run on a single hardware device, and it's more apt in scenarios such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convenient migration to new systems, as guest systems can be easily moved</li>
<li>Capacity management to add additional resources is easily managed</li>
<li>Disaster recovery for guest instances to be managed</li>
</ul>
<p>Virtualization offers benefits such as systems consolidation, and fully-managed virtualized and cost-efficient systems.</p>
<p>Cloud solutions beyond virtualization, however, offer the following capabilities, which we will discuss in detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>Self-service</li>
<li>Elasticity</li>
<li>Automation management</li>
<li>Pooled resources and scalability</li>
<li>Pay as you go service</li>
</ul>
<p>Stateful, stateless servers, and REST protocols are frequently referred with cloud computing technologies.</p>
<p>Stateful servers maintain a user's state information in the form of sessions. Once a user logs into the website, a unique identifier is created and tracked by the web service for that session. The session information will be retained for all other requests by the user till the browser is closed; this session information helps to offer a personalized service to the user. The details of the sessions also help to monitor concurrent web traffic and incorporate security features, such as preventing a malicious user trying to flood the web server with multiple simultaneous requests through an established connection.</p>
<p>Stateless servers, as the name indicates, do not maintain any state information for the user, so each request is completely independently handled as a new request unrelated to the previous request.</p>
<p>Web API's design follows stateless architecture, and uses the <strong>REpresentational State Transfer</strong> (<strong>REST</strong>) protocol. The user identity in this stateless design is through a unique user ID allocated to the user, which needs to be passed with every request.</p>
<p>REST is an architectural approach focusing on resources (or data) as a prime objective, and not on the function (functionality) that should be provided by the API. It provides better scalability, interoperability, and is aptly used in the following scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>Client server</li>
<li>Stateless servers</li>
<li>Cacheable web systems</li>
<li>Layered system</li>
<li>Code on demand</li>
<li>Uniform interface</li>
</ul>
<p>REST is a set of constraints that ensure a scalable, fault-tolerant, and easily extensible system adopted by the <strong>World Wide Web</strong> (<strong>WWW</strong>). A RESTful API can use other transfer protocols, such as SNMP, SMTP, and others. <strong>HyperText Transfer Protocol</strong> (<span><strong>HTTP</strong>) </span>is a protocol used to link pages of hypertext in the WWW. This is also a popular way to transfer files apart from other transfer protocols available, such as FTP, gopher, and so on. RESTful APIs use HTTP as a transport layer in most scenarios, since the infrastructure, servers, and client libraries for HTTP are widely adopted. A RESTful API adheres to all the REST constraints, and an HTTP API makes use of HTTP as its transfer protocol, including SOAP APIs relaying on HTTP.</p>
<p>Working with REST APIs is like the navigation between websites. HTTP and HTTPs are two-key protocols used in implementations of REST APIs. A <strong>Uniform Resource Identifier</strong> (<strong>URI</strong>) is used as an address by the REST API to access a particular website. The URI is comprised of two parts--a <strong>Uniform Resource Locator</strong> (<strong>URL</strong>) and a <strong>Uniform Resource Name</strong> (<strong>URN</strong>). The URL represents the location of a specific resource on a computer network, and defines a mechanism for retrieving it. A URN is the name of a web resource.</p>
<p>For example, <kbd>https://en.wikipedia.org</kbd> is our URL, and <kbd>/wiki/Cloud_computing_architecture</kbd> is our URN.</p>
<p>The combination<span class="URLPACKT"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_architecture">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing_architecture</a> </span>is a URI unique resource address or identifier.</p>
<p>There are four basic operations when working with any REST API to interact with a server through the HTTP protocol. They are GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE.</p>
<ul>
<li>GET will retrieve the element addressed</li>
<li>PUT will create or replace the addressed element</li>
<li>POST is used to create another element</li>
<li>DELETE will delete the addressed element</li>
</ul>
<p>These are also used to get the status of a call response; for example, the HTTP status code of 404 is for a page or address <em>Not Found</em>.</p>
<p>The two types of data formats to present the output results when working with REST APIs are <strong>JavaScript Object Notation</strong> (<strong>JSON</strong>) and <strong>eXtensible Markup Language</strong> (<strong>XML</strong>). The advantage of JSON is that it's easier to parse, and hence more preferred to XML in most cases. While XML has some more advanced features in terms of result validation and navigation, it's more complex. Using <kbd>.json</kbd> at the end of the URI, JSON formatted output is delivered.</p>

<p>REST APIs through HTTP protocol ensure authentication, a security mechanism, and data protection, they encrypt traffic between the client and server. Some APIs rely on GET requests to view data without authentication; however, for any data modifications, authentication is strictly enforced. Username and password for HTTP authentication is basic model called with Base64 hash, which not a scalable and secure model, token-based authentication mechanism known as <strong>Authtype 1/2</strong> is now more prominent for API calls.</p>

<p>Cloud architecture also follows the pattern of layered representation of presentation, business logic, and data to support the application multi-tier models. A typical architecture model with underlying components is shown in the following picture:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/53b23487-9846-44fa-8c3f-a49e2a853b37.png"/></div>
<p>This layered architecture model is supported by popular cloud vendors offering multiple value-added features and functionality at each service layer as listed.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Presentation tier</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>The presentation tier is the frontend user-facing and interacting tier. It displays on the website/webpage the information related to available services by communicating with other tiers. It sends the results to the browser for the service and query requests by coordinating with other tiers in the network such as business and data layers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Elastic infrastructure</strong>: To meet the real-time demand, hypervisors are enabled to create virtual machines or containers towards cloud infrastructure elasticity with the resources. They are enabled with self-service BI for features such as monitoring information about resource utilization, traceable billing, and provisioning of resources.</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="105" src="assets/4cfa51d8-9ac4-4d22-ada5-21a0388a9490.png" width="191"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale vertically or scale-up</strong>: Moving the application to a bigger virtual machine, or by resizing the VM (claiming back the virtual machine's capacity) to accommodate a scalable environment for the application is termed as vertical, or scale-up. This is associated with multiple dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Elastic platform scalability</strong>: This is often associated with the application layer for its capability to handle a growing amount of work. It could be possible to add or append the system, network, or process in order to cater to the business growth.</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="120" src="assets/e7231154-ec23-4fa7-a072-0adb3ab85d62.png" width="179"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scale-out or scale horizontally</strong>: This is achieved by provisioning more instances of the application tiers on additional machines (through additional resources), and then dividing the load between them. Though horizontal scaling allows the re-division of resources between applications by provisioning, the application architecture should be able to scale by additional nodes, and by distributing the load.</li>
<li><strong>Node-based availability</strong>: Most legacy applications have been developed to run on a single machine. This is where each node plays a unique role for hosted applications, and its availability is measured. These applications require recoding to adapt for both the scalability and elasticity that the cloud provides:</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="307" src="assets/83adb844-d4c6-4cd6-98f5-c546d6f06e51.png" width="325"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Environment-based availability</strong>: Applications built with multi-threaded architecture benefit from cluster-based environments with built-in elasticity and scalability. This is crucial with uneven usage, or spikes during certain periods. The applications should be designed to detect variations in the real-time demand for resources, such as bandwidth, storage, and compute power and automatically adopt:</li>
</ul>

<p>The business logic tier is also called the <strong>application tier</strong>. As the name indicates, business logic performs all the processing required by the application to send the requisite details for the presentation tier by communicating with the underlying data tiers.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Virtual networking</strong>: This is a technology to access remote systems on the networks. It is also called <strong>remote desktop sharing</strong>, and enables visual display and control of one system through other protocols, such as <strong>Remote Frame Buffer</strong> (<strong>RFB</strong>), <strong>Remote Desktop Protocol</strong> (<strong>RDP</strong>), and <strong>Apple Remote Desktop</strong> (<strong>ARD</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="109" src="assets/1f941f38-84ec-45b5-9e4f-a21837b1597e.png" width="185"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Message-oriented middleware</strong>: <strong>Message-oriented middleware</strong> (<strong>MOM</strong>) enables the sending and receiving of messages between application modules distributed over heterogeneous platforms. MOM reduces the complexity of developing applications that span multiple operating systems and network protocols through software or hardware infrastructure support. The following are some of the variants of MOM:
<ul>
<li><strong>Exactly-once delivery</strong>: For many, critical systems require exactly-once delivery of messages. By using filter conditions duplicate messages are avoided.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="113" src="assets/f3bf506e-6947-4dcd-b9e6-e930bb17099c.png" width="197"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Atleast-once delivery</strong>: To ensure that the messages are delivered at least once without loss, for each message, an associated acknowledgement is added.</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="115" src="assets/1fbdb54c-0508-496d-a4b2-c215c50ce400.png" width="208"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction-based delivery</strong>: This ensures that the message is fully delivered, and received as a transaction with ACID compliance.</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="94" src="assets/3599d6af-35c5-41d7-833c-b84a5e053017.png" width="201"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Timeout-based delivery</strong>: In this process, the message is not deleted from the system until the client system acknowledges receiving and reading the message. So, messages are stored in the system till that time, hidden from client systems as backup.</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="87" src="assets/ea4d2b3e-f65a-4b6e-95d6-74a2444096c1.png" width="167"/></div>

<p>The data tier is the repository of the data; it supports the presentation/business/application tier for processing the browser request. The request from the browser is translated into the application logic by sharing the underlying data, ensuring the confidentiality and consistency per the business demands.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Strict consistency</strong>: Multiple replicas of data are maintained at different locations to serve data redundancy in the event of failures, to ensure consistency of replicas, and also improve response time. Data replicas can be either read or write operations; their equation <em>N</em> (number of replicas) <em>&lt; R</em> (replicas access to read) <em>+W</em> (replicas accessed to write), <em>N &lt;R+W</em>, ensures data consistency.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Eventual consistency</strong>: Eventual consistency is employed by data stored at different locations; data is not consistent all the time so that performance and availability of the data are ensured with network partitioning. All replicas are updated with data alterations by asynchronously propagating over the network.</li>
</ul>

<p>Cloud platforms support many types of storage, including the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Key-value storage</strong>: We have seen that in the Map Reduce framework, the values are stored as a key-value pair, there is no schema, and the value of the data is in the form of numbers, strings, counters, JSON, XML, HTML, binaries, images, short videos, and so on. In a key-value storage, or key-value database, values are identified and accessed via a key. This form of data storage is appropriate for storing, retrieving, and managing associative arrays. This method of designing a data structure is referred to as a dictionary, or hash. Some popular databases are Aerospike, Apache Cassandra, Berkeley DB, Couchbase Server, Redis, Riak, and so on.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Blob storage</strong>: Blob is a binary large object. It is used for storing large amounts of unstructured binary data, such as text or binary data that can be accessed through web protocols, such as HTTP or HTTPS.</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="115" src="assets/9f49b7c5-b00c-47b6-bf4b-5e6887561972.png" width="170"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Block storage</strong>: Block blobs are composed of storage blocks with different sizes, and are identified by block ID. Block storage is ideally suited for streaming data, where a large video is split into smaller segments and uploaded in parallel to decrease the upload time, and assembled. This is applicable for file-sharing applications to file blocks uploaded to the storage service in parallel and then assembled into a block blob:</li>

<p>In a public cloud, the applications and services are hosted on a public cloud platform. The systems and services are easily accessible to the general public; for example, Amazon, Microsoft Azure, Google, Salesforce, and so on:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="379" src="assets/d84bfae5-c361-4fa0-a3a2-da0079f045ae.png" width="416"/></div>
<p>Benefits of the public cloud include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Economical scale</strong>: The public cloud is cost-effective by sharing the same resources with a large number of consumers</li>
<li><strong>Reliability</strong>: The public cloud maintains replicas at different locations; they serve for redundancy in case of failover, providing a high level of reliability</li>
<li><strong>Elastic scalability</strong>: The public cloud can be flexibly scaled up or down, depending on demand from a pool of resources</li>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>: Many options to choose among vendors, and also to integrate the public cloud with the private cloud and so on, are available</li>
<li><strong>Pay per use</strong>: This feature enables that resources are accessible whenever a consumer needs them</li>
</ul>

<p>In a private cloud, the applications, operating systems, cloud infrastructure, and storage are all inside the private cloud. They are operated solely for the purpose of an organization. The private cloud can be managed internally by the organization nor by a third party:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="409" src="assets/6e7cea0d-eaf9-4e76-aaff-2bd23d223847.png" width="522"/></div>
<p>The big security feature is that a firewall separates the private cloud from the external world, enhancing the security multifold from data theft:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="298" src="assets/c9428a2a-6126-4e72-8f2c-b1b03614700f.png" width="630"/></div>
<p>The benefits of a private cloud are that privacy and security of organizational information is maintained within the organization, and there is more control within the organization. Although the cost is higher to adopt for the organization, it also offers higher efficiency though enhanced security.</p>
<p>The challenges are that a private cloud's scalability is limited and depends on the organization's resource availability. Procurement could lead to inflated or inflexible pricing. The private cloud may be confined to a local geography, and may not extendable to other regions.</p>

<p>A hybrid cloud offers the best of both private and public clouds, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Security features customized and incorporated as per the organization's needs</li>
<li>Scalability features, architecture flexibility, and also the optimization of the cost efficiencies balancing between public and private models</li>
</ul>
<p>The challenges are network integrations and associated complexities, and security compliance while integrating the public and private clouds:</p>

<p>The community cloud facilitates a group of institutions, sharing systems, and services, to be accessible by all the partner groups; for example, in education, research can be set up across institutes, and the infrastructure and services could be managed by a third party. It could also be effective between various supplier groups of a large organization for effective collaboration.</p>
<p>Benefits include cost-effectiveness, and the advantages of quick community collaboration.</p>
<p>Security features are optimal as per the community needs, and are better than the public cloud.</p>
<p>Challenges could include data governance, security, and cost. Since all the data is hosted together, security should be stringent so as to avoid unauthorized access:</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As represented in the preceding diagram, in SaaS all the components and layers of offerings are owned by the provider.</p>
<p>SaaS is a model where applications are hosted on a cloud as a service that clients access through a web interface, such as browsers, over the internet. Unlike in the traditional system of installing on individual machines, clients don't need to install any specific applications on their machines nor maintain or support the applications on SaaS. The cloud provider is responsible for upgrading it or hosting any integrations, and so on. The provider does all the patching, upgrades, and ensures that the infrastructure is running, by charging fees appropriately.</p>
<p>SaaS applications are designed and built to support multiple concurrent users with web browser tools. These applications are popular for standard commercial usage in most cases, and in some scenarios offer custom-built applications, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Video conferencing</li>
<li>Content management</li>
<li>HR payroll applications</li>
<li>Team collaboration and sharing the screens, applications, and so on:</li>
</ul>

<p>Every customer as a tenant has a separate instance of the software, and the entire supporting infrastructure serves that single customer. Each tenant has their own independent database and instance of the software. There is no sharing, so every tenant is isolated from each other. The advantages are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enhanced security</li>
<li>Reliability of services</li>
<li>Easy to backup and restore</li>
<li>Easy to migrate from SaaS to self-hosted</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Upgrade control</li>

<p>Multi-tenancy means multiple organizations accessing the same server or resources; each organization (or company) is treated like a tenant. The architecture has a centralized compute, storage, and networking, serving to multiple customers by sharing the infrastructure and software. Each customer shares the supporting infrastructure and a single database. To each tenant, the system looks like it has been customized for them. The data is partitioned between the customers and encrypted to serve them separately; all the customers share the same copy of the application code, making it a multi-tenant cloud application. Fewer IT resources are needed to patch, maintain, and upgrade the application (reduced TCO).</p>
<p>Multi-tenancy is achieved by two methods: multi-tenancy through instance replication, and through data segregation effective multi-tenancy. Instance replication becomes an overhead as the number of tenants grows and accordingly the VM's explode, causing performance and maintenance overheads.</p>

<p>Multi-instance instances are deployed on a per-user demand to scale horizontally and infinitely the multi-instance cloud. A separate application logic and database processes are deployed for every client, together with a dedicated set of unique instances as per the organization's needs. The multi-instance system offers data isolation, as customers are not sharing databases and infrastructure.</p>
<p>The multi-instance environment offers many benefits, including greater flexibility, and higher data security, preventing unwarranted intrusion. Its architecture makes it easy to deploy and scale to meet higher performance and SLA's adherence or 24×7 seamless service experiences. It facilitates for better manageability of product updates, upgrades, configuration management, and customization. The customer's services can continue to be available, while migrating to an on-premise server, or to another cloud for routine maintenance and unexpected issues. To create and manage multiple application instances, it's an effective model.</p>
<p>The challenges are that to maintain and upgrade the multiple-instance environments, such as databases and web application instances, it is expensive compared to the multi-tenancy model as propagation of functionality, or features from one instance to multiple instances is not supported.</p>

<p>Many platform (IaaS) vendors have moved away from just nuts and bolts providers of operating systems, networking, and so on; they are providing other value-added offerings such as tools for application development and performance metrics. They offer platforms along with an operating environment to enable better value-added offerings so that developers can build or deploy applications with this support.</p>
<p>Examples of PaaS tied to an operating environment include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows Azure</strong>: Maturing from just an infrastructure (IaaS), Azure is offering many tools from Windows, SQL abstractions, development tools, management, and services, to make it a fully-fledged PaaS.</li>
<li><strong>AWS Elastic Beanstalk</strong>: This is a PaaS that Amazon packages with <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong>AWS</strong>) for deploying applications. Elastic Beanstalk has in-built automation, which benefits organizations to automate, auto-scale as per the demands change, and control for the underlying IaaS resources.</li>

<p>Open-platform PaaS are not tied to any single cloud implementation; developers can develop their own custom tools or open source tools as per the platform. Migration between clouds is convenient by an open platform PaaS. These platforms are well suited for a hybrid cloud environment, supporting deployment on both public and private clouds.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of open-platform PaaS:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>OpenShift</strong>: From Red Hat, this is fully integrated with advanced offerings also with the JBoss application server and middle layer. Applications supported are Java, Python, Perl, PHP, Ruby, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>Cloud Foundry</strong>: This offers VMware public clouds, vSphere, and vCloud, for building, deploying, and operating applications based on the cloud, supporting a wider range of languages, such as .NET, Java, Scala, and Ruby.</li>
<li><strong>Engine Yard</strong>: This is a fully managed PaaS used in conjunction with a number of private clouds and public clouds such as Azure, and AWS. Applications can be built for languages such as Ruby on Rails, and PHP.</li>
<li><strong>CloudBees</strong>: This is a platform that offers a full life cycle application for public and hybrid clouds. It's primarily a Java-based platform to support, build, test, run, manage, and develop, independent of the underlying platform.</li>
<li><strong>OrangeScape</strong>: This offers support for a private or public cloud, and offers portability as well. The main feature is process-oriented application development with OrangeScape Studio for non-programmers. It has pre-built business templates ready for use.</li>
<li><strong>Apprenda</strong>: This is specific to .NET applications development predominantly for Azure PaaS. Organizations can redeploy the applications to other on-premises, or public clouds.</li>
<li><strong>DotCloud</strong>: This is a multi-stack solution with the flexibility of multiple languages, databases, caching, and messaging components. The languages supported on the platform are Java, Perl, Ruby, and PHP.</li>
<li><strong>CumuLogic</strong>: This is a platform for cloud services that supports automation, autoscaling, monitoring, resource management, and user management for Java-based platforms for both public and private clouds.</li>
</ul>
<p>An open source platform as service would include the entire suite of open source applications. Cloudera Enterprise distribution offers an entire bundle of components for the<br/>
big data Hadoop platform as Platform services comprising of 20 components (listed following) ranging from <strong>Extract Transform Load</strong> (<strong>ETL</strong>) applications to <strong>Machine language Libraries</strong> (<strong>MLLs</strong>) as a full suite of Platform as a Service:</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Here, we are giving an example of the Cloudera Enterprise package for PaaS so it will be in accordance with its own specification.</div>

<li><strong>Apache Hbase</strong>: This is popular for columnar storage for Hadoop; it's scalable with random read/write access.</li>
<li><strong>Apache Flume</strong>: This is a stream data processing framework to collect and aggregate event data in real time into HDFS or HBase .</li>
<li><strong>Apache Hadoop</strong>: This is the most popular storage; it also offers data processing and resource management.</li>
<li><strong>Apache DataFu</strong>: Statistical evaluation-oriented user-defined functions for large-scale data analysis written in PIG.</li>
<li><strong>Apache Avro</strong>: This is the framework for data serialization with rich data structures in binary format and RPC.</li>
<li><strong>Apache Crunch</strong>: This is a framework with user defined functions written in Java for writing, testing, and running Map Reduce pipelines.</li>
<li><strong>HUE</strong>: Hadoop User Experience for web-based graphics user interfaces; it is user friendly to work with Hadoop data.</li>
<li><strong>Kite SDK</strong>: Software development kit with the Application Program Interface. It has examples and documentation for creating applications on Hadoop</li>
<li><strong>Cloudera search</strong>: This is the search engine for free-text, and is Google style for business users using Hadoop data.</li>
<li><strong>Apache Zookeeper</strong>: This is the resource coordination service. It is highly effective and reliable, and distributes the Hadoop environment <strong>Infrastructure as a Service</strong> (<strong>IaaS</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>IaaS provides access to infrastructure resources. Customers can benefit from the service on lease to use for their own use as per the timeline agreed upon. The fundamental resources are physical machines, virtual machines, virtual storage, and so on.</p>
<p>Apart from these primary resources, IaaS also extends resources to the end user through server virtualization; they include virtual machine disk storage, <strong>virtual local area networks</strong> (<strong>VLANs</strong>), load balancers, IP addresses, and software bundles.</p>
<p>Infrastructure as a Service is a flexible and efficient mode of renting hardware computer resources such as virtual machines, storages, bandwidth, IP addresses, monitoring services, firewalls, and so on. The consumer has to pay based on the length of time a consumer retains a resource.</p>
<p>The process is also quite simple and convenient, with administrative access to virtual machines. The consumer can also run any software, start web servers, install new applications, or even custom operating systems.</p>
<p>IaaS platforms also support portability and interoperability between cloud platforms. For example, network applications such as web servers and email servers that are running on consumer-owned server hardware, can be ported to run from VMs in the IaaS cloud.</p>
<p>The challenges with IaaS are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Similar to the challenges faced by PaaS and SaaS, network dependence and browser-based risks exist for IaaS.</li>
<li>IaaS supports the consumer to run legacy software in the VM infrastructure; it could expose security vulnerabilities associated with such legacy software:</li>
</ul>

<p>IaaS for Linux platforms offers all the following popular models on cloud as virtual machines:</p>
<ul>
<li>CentOS</li>
<li>Debian</li>
<li>Kali</li>
<li>Red Hat</li>
<li>SUSE</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
</ul>
<p>The two popular cloud platforms offering IaaS are Amazon Web Service, and Microsoft Azure. These platforms, as discussed, offer much more than IaaS; they have offerings also as PaaS and SaaS.</p>

<p>In line with other offerings such as IaaS and PaaS, NaaS is also made available as a value-added service and network as a utility based on the pay-per-use model. NaaS uses a virtualized network infrastructure to provide network services; it enables access to the network infrastructure directly and securely. Customers can deploy custom routing protocols; however, the NaaS provider is responsible for maintaining network resources to ensure workload is supported.</p>
<p>NaaS offers multiple benefits, including being part of portals such as AWS and Azure. Customer networks are independent and segregated logically, as is traffic. Network bandwidth capacity can be accommodated, and customers only pay for usage. There is redundancy and resilience built in for backup. NaaS is convenient for the addition of new service elements. It offers a high-sensitive data protection specialized solution.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Identity as a service (IDaaS)</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p><strong>Identity as a service</strong> (<strong>IDaaS</strong>) is an important service and key feature that is the backbone for other service offerings such as IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. IDaaS enables a set of identity and access management functionalities, to facilitate customers with the service through systems setup either on the client premises, or in the cloud.</p>
<p>IDaaS functionality includes the following broad areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Identity governance and administration</strong>: This is the ability to secure digital information assets of the organization and adapt to governance policies</li>
<li><strong>Identity access management</strong>: This provides access to users for things such as authentication, <strong>Single Sign-on</strong> (<strong>SSO</strong>), and authorization as per role enforcement</li>
<li><strong>Intelligence metrics</strong>: Logging events, audit and compliance, and reporting details on access such as what was accessed, by whom, and when?</li>
</ul>
<p>IDaaS solutions are flexible to store the organization's identity directory either on-premises, or in the cloud. On-premise Active Directory, or LDAP, is required in organizations for higher control and safety, which are important. They are supported with failover and automatic load balancing for continued service. Cloud-based IDaaS is also quite popular, and includes Google Directory, and so on. LDAP or Active Directory, are integrated through firewalls as per business needs. Managing identities requires a fine balance of security and productivity, with the optimal plan meeting the criteria. Audit compliance is an important feature to enforce policies, track cloud activities, and detect anomalies, by controlling access privileges to prevent unauthorized data loss through applications or environments.</p>
<p>It is critical that IDaaS has the ability to enforce granular policies to provide secure access and control of cloud apps to prevent data loss or theft. The business needs to acquire and deploy sanctioned and unsanctioned cloud applications in order to address critical organization needs. A strict policy discipline for data access is therefore imperative and mandatory.</p>
<p>IDaaS offers management of identity (information) as a digital entity. This identity can be used during electronic transactions.</p>
<p>A unique identification attribute is assigned to uniquely identify a digital asset or an object as a digital entity. All objects may have the same attributes, but their identity cannot be the same, so a set of attributes associated with them are identified to make them uniquely recognizable. These identity services are in demand for deployment to validate services such as websites, transactions, transaction participants, clients, and so on.</p>
<p>We have already seen the three broad areas of IDaaS. The following shows the finer segregation of the services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Federated services</li>
<li>Single sign-on services</li>
<li>Registration</li>
<li>Authentication services</li>
<li>Risk and event monitoring</li>
<li>Identity and profile management</li>
<li>Directory services</li>
</ul>
<p>We will look at the identity solutions next.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>SSO is the most popular technology adopted across industries and companies to alleviate the need to use multiple username and password combination credentials for different servers. Single Sign-On software enables the user to login only once with credentials, and provides the user access to all the systems.</p>
<p>The SSO landscape has a single authentication server and, as shown in the following diagram, manages access to multiple systems:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="209" src="assets/0e98d7de-1f3f-4e55-a74a-97e27b472880.png" width="576"/></div>
<p>The SSO modus operandi is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>With the credentials of username and password, log into the authentication server</li>
<li>The user browser gets a ticket from the authentication server</li>
<li>The ticket is sent to the intranet server by the user's browser</li>
<li>The ticket is sent to the authentication server by the intranet server</li>
<li>The user security credentials are sent by the authentication to the intranet server</li>
</ul>
<p>Maintenance is easy for the addition or deletion of access with just the authentication server, which in turn reflects the user's access to all the supporting systems:</p>

<p>As the name indicates, the security credentials are federated across security domains supported with technologies and protocols. <strong>Security Assertion Markup Language</strong> (<strong>SAML</strong>) is a prime mover to package a user's security credentials, as shown in the following diagram:</p>

<p>Security is major focus and concerning area while referring to cloud computing. There are multiple means of handling it as per the type of cloud, be it public, private, communal, or hybrid. It begins with effective planning to analyze several attributes on the sensitivity to risk in the context of the various models--IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS. With each of these models, the responsibilities of the client versus the cloud provider for security at different levels of the service need to be thoroughly understood.</p>
<p>Some pointers to gather relevant inputs in this light are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How the application or resource is deployed on the cloud</li>
<li>Data encrypted form for storage in the cloud</li>
<li>Proxy and brokerage services should be employed</li>
<li>The need to restrict direct access to the shared data</li>
<li>The cloud provider's system and tools for data transfer into and out of the cloud</li>
</ul>
<p>Each cloud deployment model, depending on the service models and cloud types, brings in its own risks. The responsibilities between the cloud service provider and consumer are defined based on the offerings and business requirements:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="501" src="assets/b58f93f2-456e-45e6-b2ef-f1b499526c5d.png" width="546"/></div>
<div class="packt_figure packt_figref CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign">Source: Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) (https://cloudsecurityalliance.org/csaguide.pdf)</div>
<p>As represented in the preceding diagram, IaaS is the basic level of service offering, which is followed by PaaS, and then SaaS. The security features and concerns are inherited from one layer to another, compounded in the order of from IaaS (infrastructure) to PaaS, and to SaaS. Thus, in the integrated system, IaaS has the lowest level of integrated functionalities and security, while SaaS has the highest level of offerings. The responsibilities are shared between vendor and client as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Depending on the service boundary</li>
<li>As agreed upon in the business terms</li>
<li>Depending on the cloud model adopted (public, private, hybrid, and so on)</li>
</ul>
<p>Cloud data security is of vital importance, irrespective of the model and service selected. Data security enforcement includes the following options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Access control</li>
<li>Auditing</li>
<li>Authentication</li>
<li>Authorization</li>
</ul>
<p>Data stored in the cloud can be accessed from any location; therefore, an adequate data protection mechanism to isolate the data directly from client access needs to be incorporated. One of the effective approaches for isolating storage in the cloud is <strong>Brokered Cloud Storage Access</strong>.</p>
<p>In this method, two services are created:</p>
<ul>
<li>A broker with full access to storage, but no access to the client</li>
<li>A proxy with no access to storage, but with access to both the client and broker</li>
</ul>
<p>When the client tries to access the data in the Brokered Cloud Storage system, it follows the following workflow:</p>
<ol>
<li>The client data request hits the proxy's external service interface.</li>
<li>The proxy forwards the request to broker.</li>
<li>The broker makes data request to the cloud storage system.</li>
<li>The cloud storage system returns the data to the broker.</li>
<li>The broker returns data to the proxy.</li>
<li>The proxy sends data to the client.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are depicted in the following diagram:</p>

<p>Encryption safeguards the data from unauthorized access. It prevents data being compromised for the data in motion (in transition, or being transferred), and also data at rest (static, stored in the cloud). However, encryption cannot avoid data loss like disk failure, and so on.</p>

<p>Cloud services are centralized repositories of often sensitive information, so the security aspects should be strengthened more vigorously than a single user laptop or mobile. The cyber security industry has been innovating and investing in technologies and processes to protect cloud servers such as firewalls, threat detection and analysis, and encryption mechanisms. There are different modes of data encryption, as shown in the following topics.</p>

<p>Using technologies such as <strong>Secure Sockets Layer</strong> (<strong>SSL</strong>), or <strong>Transport Layer Security</strong> (<strong>TLS</strong>), the encryption in transit is used to secure a message being transmitted from a phone or computer to the server. This will be secure while the message is on internet, and the decrypted message is available to both the device and the server. This makes the server vulnerable to attack, as the data is in unencrypted format, and messages are available in decrypted format:</p>

<p><strong>Encryption-at-rest</strong> means that data is encrypted when not being used, like in the storage media on cloud servers. However, since the server has decrypted information, it's vulnerable, and not completely safe.</p>

<p>This will provide the complete solution by securing the data, not just the devices:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="216" src="assets/3e3ccdb8-6541-4c48-9144-560da262c814.png" width="477"/></div>
<p>In the end-to-end encryption process, the messages are encrypted right from the device of the sender, till they reach the device of the recipient to be decrypted. So, with end-to-end encryption, the server never has access to the decrypted data, and will not compromise any user information. So here, the security is on the data itself, and not limited to the devices.</p>
<p>Additional data security measures are implanted by several features, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Secure processor acting as a microcontroller</li>
<li>Secure encrypted virtualization</li>
<li>Secure memory encryption</li>
<li>Secure off-chip storage for firmware and data</li>
<li>Cryptographic functionality for secure key generation and key management</li>
<li>Hardware validated boot (TPM)</li>
</ul>
<p>DRAM-level encryption is achieved with the AES-128 engine directly attached to the MMU to safeguard against physical memory attacks.</p>
<p>The OS, or hypervisor, can select the pages to encrypt via page tables.</p>
<p>However, DMA engine- encrypted pages are accessed by external devices such as network storage, and graphics cards.</p>
<p>With its own encryption key, each VM, or container, works in isolation in protecting against cross-contamination. The keys are transparent to the VMs themselves, and managed by the protected hypervisor.</p>
<p>Data contamination is handled with reporting, and a machine check recovery mode.</p>

<p>Best practices for cloud computing backup and recovery follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Four copies of the data are maintained for zero data loss and easy disaster recovery</li>
<li>Two copies of the data would be kept in the primary data center with synchronous replication and for high availability</li>
<li>The third copy of the data will be kept in another data center as a backup</li>
<li>The fourth will be kept in a backup in a different data center and seismic zone using asynchronous replication:</li>
</ul>
