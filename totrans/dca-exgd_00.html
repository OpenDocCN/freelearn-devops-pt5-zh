                    Preface
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">Microservices and containers have changed the way developers create new applications. Microservice architectures allow us to decouple applications in their components, and today we have tools that can provide them with orchestrated and seamless interactions. Also, containers have changed the deployment artifacts for applications. We have moved from binaries to container images. This new development workflow helps developers to build applications faster and more securely, and ensures that the final product will work as intended, anywhere, without many modifications. Applications deployed as containers will follow general code versioning rules, which helps us to keep track of component releases and behavior.</p>
<p class="mce-root">This book will introduce microservices and containers and will help us to learn the key concepts of these technologies. We will learn how containers work, see how networks are implemented in different scenarios, and explore Docker Swarm and Kubernetes orchestration strategies and environments. We will also cover all the Docker Enterprise components and features required to implement Container as a Service platforms in production. All the topics covered in this book, with sample questions and detailed answers, will help you to learn the knowledge required to pass the official Docker Certified Associate exam. </p>
<h1 id="uuid-6fd1e748-bf1b-410b-afc2-543455a9cd47">Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is intended for people who want to learn about container technology and who are preparing for the Docker Certified Associate exam. This book was also written as a guide for Docker Enterprise products and serves as an introduction to Kubernetes' terminology and features.</p>
<p>Good Linux and Windows user knowledge is required, and some networking skills will help you to understand container networking and the use of load balancers and proxies to provide a full-featured Container as a Service environment.</p>
<p>The labs in this book are focused on Linux hosts because most current Docker Enterprise components are deployed on Linux operating systems. Windows hosts can be part of Docker Swarm and Kubernetes clusters, but control planes are deployed using Linux hosts.</p>

<p>In order to follow the book's labs and examples, it is recommended to have Docker Engine installed on your computer. A set of virtual environments is provided for you to allow you to run all the labs without modifying your computer. There are also many labs in which you have to deploy clusters, with many nodes involved. The labs will deploy virtual machines so you don't have to install many nodes, although you can deploy all the labs on your own infrastructure of hosts.</p>
<p>The provided virtual environments require Vagrant (<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/">https://www.vagrantup.com/</a>) and VirtualBox (<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">https://www.virtualbox.org/</a>) to be installed on your computer. Docker images and software will be downloaded from the internet, so internet connectivity is also required. The following table shows the computer resources required to run all of the book's labs. You will free up resources by destroying environments once all the labs from each section or chapter are completed.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>The labs from chapters 1 to 6 require one node. A minimum of 2 vCPUs and 4 GB of RAM is required. The labs from chapter 8 and chapter 9 will deploy 4 and 3 virtual nodes respectively, and more local resources are required. In these cases, you will need at least 4 vCPUs and 8 GB of RAM on your computer. The Docker Enterprise labs require more resources because the platform has quite large CPU and memory requirements per virtual node. These labs will run smoothly with at least 8 vCPUs and 16 GB of RAM because the Vagrant environment will deploy 4 virtual nodes with 4 GB of RAM per node.</p>
<p>In terms of disk space, your computer should have at least 100 GB of free disk for the biggest environment.</p>
<p>The minimum required Vagrant version is 2.2.8, while the minimum required version of VirtualBox is 6.0.0. The labs can be executed on macOS, Windows 10, and Linux. The labs were tested on the Ubuntu Linux 18.04 LTS and Windows 10 Pro operating systems during the writing of this book.</p>
<p>All labs can be executed on Docker Swarm, Kubernetes, and Docker Enterprise, although it is recommended to use virtual environments to execute all the labs' steps, including installation procedures.</p>
<p><strong>If you are using the digital version of this book, we advise you to type the code yourself or access the code via the GitHub repository (link available in the next section). Doing so will help you avoid any potential errors related to the copying and pasting of code.</strong></p>
