    use case would be a certificate, SSH private keys, passwords, and so on. Secrets
    should stay secret meaning that they should not be stored unencrypted or transmitted
    over a network.

- en: Until secrets were introduced, a common way to pass information to containers
    was through environment variables. While that will continue being the preferable
    way for non-confidential information, part of the setup should involve secrets
    as well. Both should be combined. The question is which method to choose and when.
  id: totrans-73

- en: The obvious use case for Docker secrets are secrets. That was obvious, wasn't
    it. If there is a piece of information that should remain invisible to anyone
    but specific containers, it should be provided through Docker secrets. A commonly
    used pattern is to allow the same information to be specified as either environment
    variable and a secret. In case that both a set, secrets should take precedence.
    You already saw this pattern through *Docker Flow Proxy*. Every piece of information
    that can be specified through environment variables can be specified as a secret
    as well.

- en: In some cases, you might not be able to modify code of your service and adapt
    it to use secrets. Maybe it's not a question of ability but lack of desire to
    modify your code. If you fall into the latter case, I will, for now, restrain
    myself from explaining why code should be continuously refactored and imagine
    that you have a very good reason for it. In either case, the solution is usually
    to create a wrapper script that transforms secrets into whatever your service
    needs and then invoke the service. Put that script as CMD instruction in *Dockerfile*
    and you're done. Secrets stay secrets and you don't get fired from refactoring
    your code. To some this last sentence sounds silly but it's not uncommon for companies
    to consider refactoring a waste of time.

    CMD 指令放入 *Dockerfile* 中，这样就完成了。机密信息保持为机密，你也不必因为重构代码而被解雇。对于某些人来说，这最后一句话听起来有些傻，但对于很多公司来说，重构代码被认为是浪费时间并不罕见。

    be a good candidate for Docker secrets. They do not necessarily have to be used
    only as means of specifying confidential information. We can use secrets as a
    way to provide information that differs from one cluster to another. In such a
    case, pieces of configuration that should differ from one environment to another
