- en: This book teaches you how to take advantage of the new benefits of containerization
    systems such as Docker, Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, and Docker UCP, without losing
    the panoptical power of proper configuration management. You will learn to integrate
    your containerized applications and modules with your Puppet workflow.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Installing Docker with Puppet"), *Installing
    Docker with Puppet*, covers how to create a development environment with Docker
    using Puppet. We will look at how to install Vagrant and VirtualBox. Then, we
    will look at Puppet Forge and how to search for modules and their dependencies.
    We will briefly touch upon r10k to be our transport mechanism from the Puppet
    Forge to our environment. Then, we build our environment with Puppet.'

    *Building a Single Container Application*, contains our first Puppet module to
    create a Docker container. In this chapter, we will look at writing rspec-puppet
    unit tests to make sure that our module does what it''s meant to do. We will know
    how to map our Puppet module dependencies with our `metadata.json` and `fixtures.yml`
    files.'

    Multicontainer Applications*, introduces Docker Compose. We will look at the docker-compose
    `.yaml` file construct. We will then take that knowledge and create a Puppet template
    (`.erb` file) and wrap that into a module. We will also touch on the Docker Compose
    functionality that will let us scale containers.'

    Networking"), *Configuring Service Discovery and Docker Networking*, introduces
    two very important topics when working with containers. First, we will look at
    service discovery, what it is, why do we need it, and lastly, the different types
    of service discovery.'

    introduces all the skills that you''ve learned in the book so far. We are really
    going to step it up a notch. In this chapter, we are going to deploy four servers,
    and we are going to look at how to Consul cluster. In this chapter, we are going
    to look at the two ways to network our containers. Firstly, using the stand host
    IP network, that our Consul cluster will communicate on. We will also install
    the **ELK** (**Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, and **Kibana**) stack.'

    covers container schedulers such as Docker Swarm and Kubernetes. Then, we will
    build a dev environment containing four servers, three cluster nodes, and a master.
    We will also build a Docker network and service discovery framework.'

    *Logging, Monitoring, and Recovery Techniques*, will take the environment that
    we created in the last chapter and add monitoring, logging, and recovery techniques
    to it. This will make our applications robust and ready for production.'

    Practices for the Real World*, focuses more on the best practices for deploying
    Puppet itself within a containerized environment using all the new skills that
    you learned in the previous chapters. By the end of this journey, readers will
    be able to master Puppet and Docker and apply them in the real world.'
