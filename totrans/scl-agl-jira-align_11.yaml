    report on agile projects to executives who want waterfall style reports, replace
    legacy time tracking systems with an add-on for Jira Align, host Jira Align on-premises,
    use an agile approach to earned value that can satisfy reporting requirements

- en: Garter coined the term *bimodal* when advising companies to embrace a more innovative
    and nimble approach to product delivery. Mode 1 is the traditional approach of
    waterfall development with long cycle times. The analogy for mode 1 is the marathon
    runner. Mode 2 represents the newer agile approach to product development, with
    short cycle times. The analogy for mode 2 is the sprinter.

    Some have agile teams under waterfall management. Others have pure agile in some
    areas and waterfall in others. Furthermore, agile isn't a "one size fits all"
    approach. The sweet spot of agile is the realm of the complicated and the complex,
    when the *what* and/or the *how* is uncertain or not agreed upon. When what you
    are developing and how you are going to develop it are both well understood and
    agreed upon, then waterfall is a great approach. Because of this, Jira Align has
    been built to accommodate bimodal development.

    agile tool, but you can''t "*agile*" a waterfall tool. Thus tools focused on traditional
    Gantt project schedules and methods are ill-equipped to handle things such as
    burndown and velocity charts, let alone program boards and OKR trees. We''ll now
    cover some Jira Align features that support bimodal development.'

- en: First, it's important to establish a bimodal operating agreement. This includes
    a common lexicon, particularly for people, work, time, and outcome definitions.
    For example, a portfolio practicing agile may be defined as a collection of development
    value streams while one practicing waterfall may define it as a business unit
    with its own P&L (profit and loss) statement, or a product line. Likewise, an
    agile program is a team of agile teams, while a waterfall program may represent
    the people working on a particular product within a product line.

    funded project for business units operating in a waterfall model. While agile
    teams will associate a hypothesis statement with an epic and break it down into
    features and stories, a waterfall portfolio can associate a business requirements
    document with the epic. Many companies change "Portfolio Epic" to the more generic
    term, "Initiative" in **Administration** | **Settings** | **Platform Terminology**.
    In this way, an initiative can represent an epic for agile portfolios and a project
    for a waterfall portfolio.

    agile and waterfall teams can still collaborate. Themes are the work item that

    waterfall portfolios and then generate a theme status report to see the combined
    data across portfolios.

    programs in a portfolio follow a common cadence. For an agile portfolio, the program
    increment is comprised of sprints that sync with Jira Software and represent the
    shared agile team cadence. For a waterfall portfolio, you can create a program
    increment with sprints representing the toll gates or phases of a project. These
    would sync with sprints in Jira Software that have names and dates to match the
    phases in Jira Align.

    methods for estimating work items: T-shirt size and points for agile estimation
    and team weeks for traditional estimation. A **team week** (**TW**) is similar
    to a **member week** (**MW**) except that it relates to the team level rather
    than the individual. Note that a team week is a measure of time independent of
    the size of a team. Therefore, if a portfolio epic is sized at 30 TW, it doesn''t
    matter if it''s a team of 5 or 11 members doing the work, the capacity is still
    the same. Each portfolio can have its own estimation method. The selection is
    made in **Administration** | **Settings** | **Platform** | **Portfolio** | **Estimation

    stories into tasks and provide estimated and actual hours at the task level, time
    tracking is generally not considered core to agile methods. Since organizations
    transitioning to agile or operating in a bimodal manner may require time tracking
    concurrent with agile estimation in story points, Atlassian provides a time tracking
    module for Jira Align. This goes beyond the roll-up of task hours flowing in from
    Jira Software to include time cards, booking time against various cost centers,

    product. Atlassian takes a standards-based approach to security and holds industry-accepted
    certifications. Atlassian holds SOC 2 Type 2 and SOC 3 certifications that are
    validated by external third-party audits over an extended period. Details including

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The standard SaaS deployment option for Jira Align uses common data architecture
    patterns of multi-tenant database applications that run in a **virtual private
    cloud** (**VPC**) environment. The multi-tenant VPCs have an underlying SQL structure
    that separates each Jira Align customer's data on the database service into separated
    data stores.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By customer request, Atlassian can create "dedicated" VPCs, meaning that the
    VPC network is not shared with other customers, to essentially provide a dedicated
    database for additional security. This approach also allows customer-managed keys
    for encryption at rest, the ability to audit at will, penetration testing, and
    improved capacity overhead.

    there are organizations that require the highest level of security. As recently
    as 2016, some large Fortune 500 companies were reluctant to use the standard SaaS
    deployment and opted instead to host Jira Align on-premises. The on-premises option
    carries a higher price tag and requires that the organization's own tools team
    apply the upgrades that Jira Align releases every two weeks. The added licensing
    and internal maintenance costs can add up. We've therefore seen the same Fortune
    500 companies move to the SaaS product within three years.

    Government agencies such as the U.S. **Department of Defense** (**DoD**), a customer
    of Jira Align and of SAFe, host Jira Align on-premises so it's likely to remain
    an option into the foreseeable future. Agile practices and the tools to support
    them have been gaining in popularity among government organizations in recent
    years.

    time, and costs to objectively measure performance and progress. Performance is
    measured by determining the budgeted cost of work performed, also known as **earned
    value** (**EV**), and comparing it to the **actual cost** (**AC**) of work performed.
    Progress is measured by comparing the EV with the **planned value** (**PV**).'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    and **schedule performance index** (**SPI**). CPI is the ratio of earned value
    to actual costs (EV divided by AC). SPI is the ratio of earned value to planned
    value (EV divided by PV).

    threshold is met and calls are blocked, you'll receive the HTTP **429 Too Many
