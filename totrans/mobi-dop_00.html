<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>Mobile DevOps is the future of continuous integration and continuous delivery for mobile application development, and is a very important requirement of today's fast-paced development culture. While DevOps has been implemented and adopted by most fast-growing development teams today, mobile DevOps is yet to be used by the majority of the mobile development world. It is something that can improve integration and delivery, as well as provide a greater feedback mechanism and early defect capturing tools.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>Mobile DevOps comes with its own implementation challenges, and with various mobile platforms out there on millions of devices and with different aspect ratios, it is only becoming more important to use tools that streamline testing on physical devices and delivery to customers while providing a quick feedback mechanism to developers.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>In this book, we'll be using Xamarin to explore mobile application development fundamentals and tools. Xamarin is a cross-platform mobile application development framework from Microsoft that can be used to create iOS, Android, and Windows apps using a shareable code base and design. Apart from Xamarin, we'll be using other tools from Microsoft's tool belt, such as Xamarin Test Cloud and Visual Studios Team Services, to dive deep into the different phases of mobile DevOps.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>The main motivation to use Xamarin is its ability to develop cross-platform applications and applications with great integration with Microsoft's other widely used tools for different phases of the application development cycle.</span></p>
<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>By the end of this book, you should not only be accustomed with mobile DevOps and mobile application development, but you should also be able to implement, configure, and troubleshoot each and every step involved in the mobile DevOps life cycle in your new and/or existing mobile application projects using the popular tools that are available.</span></p>

<p class="NormalPACKT"><span>This book is mainly intended for mobile application developers, DevOps engineers, and small teams willing to apply DevOps to their mobile application development life cycle. Developers already using Visual Studio and/or C# as a programming language are encouraged to use this book to start cross-platform mobile application development and understand the workings of continuous delivery and continuous integration.<br/>
If you are already a Xamarin developer, then this book will help you streamline fast-paced development, continuous testing, and the frequent delivery management process by implementing mobile DevOps in your project.</span></p>

<p>This book assumes a medium-level knowledge of the Windows operating system and basic knowledge of cloud computing and the application development life cycle, and also beginner-level knowledge of object-oriented programming languages such as Java or C#. The book will go through various phases of the mobile DevOps life cycle, which requires a basic understanding of application development fundamentals and application delivery. If you have experience with Visual Studio and with programming with C#, this is a big plus.</p>
<p>The minimum requirements to install Visual Studio and Xamarin are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows requirements: Windows 7</li>
<li>Android 6.0/API level 23</li>
</ul>
<p>The following are the hardware requirements for Android Emulator:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hyper-V support</li>
<li>4 GB or more RAM</li>
<li>64-bit version of Windows OS</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that since the Android SDK Emulator is prohibitively slow without hardware acceleration, Intel's Hardware Accelerated Execution Manager (<span>HAXM)</span> is the recommended way to drastically improve the performance of the Android Emulator.</p>
<p>Internet connectivity is required to install the necessary Visual Studio and Xamarin.Android packages and Git, and to connect with Xamarin Test Cloud.</p>
