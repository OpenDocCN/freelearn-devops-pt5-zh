		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-145"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor145"/>Chapter 9</em>: Duplicating Projects and Starting Outside the Box</h1>
			<p>So far, we have explored and learned how to get up and running with <strong class="bold">Jira Work Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">JWM</strong>) quickly by making use of the standard or out-of-the-box functions of JWM. This typically means creating projects and issues directly in the product by simply clicking on a few buttons and adding some text. </p>
			<p>This chapter will venture off the beaten path and look at ways to create issues from outside of the tool. This provides us with flexibility as to how our customers and internal teammates can get work requests to us and removes some of the friction when starting new work.</p>
			<p>If you have already been using the Jira Software and/or <strong class="bold">Jira Service Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">JSM</strong>) projects but want to take advantage of the cool new features of JWM with your existing work, we will learn how to migrate existing projects to JWM. Finally, we will have one more look at a Marketplace app to help with creating issues based on existing issues.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a id="_idTextAnchor146"/>Creating a project based on an existing project</li>
				<li>Using shared schemes</li>
				<li>Creating issues externally</li>
				<li>Migrating existing Jira projects to JWM</li>
				<li>Working with Marketplace apps – Deep Clone for Jira</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By completing this chapter, you will have learned how to create a new project based on an existing project and how to mimic that using shared schemes. You will have also learned some alternative methods to creating issues from outside of the system and how to migrate projects within Jira to JWM.</p>
			<p>Let's get started!</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor147"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As JWM is only available in the Jira Cloud environment, the requirement for this chapter is simple: <em class="italic">you must have access to a Jira Cloud environment</em>.</p>
			<p>Atlassian provides a free JWM account for up to 10 users. You can create an account by going to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free">https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free</a> and following the instructions provided. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor148"/>Creating a project based on an existing project</h1>
			<p>Although we have seen that the availability of project templates is numerous for quickly creating projects in JWM, we will often tweak those initial settings once the project has been created. This might entail modifying the workflow or adjusting/adding fields to the screen.</p>
			<p>At this stage, it may be helpful if subsequent similar projects that we create make use of the changes we have made. In effect, we have created a new <em class="italic">template</em> for our project. So, the question is, how can we create new projects using the changed objects that are attached to existing projects?</p>
			<p>The answer is to<a id="_idIndexMarker460"/> create a new project based on the existing project. Let's learn how to do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>First, we will begin as we normally would; that is, by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> option from the top navigation bar and selecting <strong class="bold">Create project</strong>: <div><img src="img/Figure_9.1_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1 – Creating a project&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.1 – Creating a project</p></li>
				<li>This leads us to the group of JWM templates we saw in <a href="B17952_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Project Templates</em>. To investigate an alternative route to these templates, let's click on <strong class="bold">Jira Work Management</strong>, which can be found at the bottom left of the screen.</li>
				<li>Once<a id="_idIndexMarker461"/> again, a list of all the JWM project templates will be displayed, as shown in the following screenshot. In our scenario, let's say we want to create a new project for the technology division's monthly meetings. We have decided that it should follow the same pattern we have already set up for our Staff Meeting project. From here, we must select <strong class="bold">Project management</strong>: <div><img src="img/Figure_9.2_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.2 – JWM project templates&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.2 – JWM project templates</p></li>
				<li>As soon as we <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>arrive on the next screen, we can simply click on the <strong class="bold">Use template</strong> button at the top or bottom of the screen:<div><img src="img/Figure_9.3_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.3 – Use template&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.3 – Use template</p></li>
				<li>Finally, the <strong class="bold">Add project details</strong> screen will be displayed. Note that, once again, you will encounter a difference if you are using the free subscription. Creating a project based on an existing project is not available for those plans:<div><img src="img/Figure_9.4_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.4 – Add project details&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.4 – Add project details</p></li>
				<li>Let's continue by<a id="_idIndexMarker463"/> looking at the process for those with a paid subscription. Enter a <strong class="bold">Name</strong> for the new project, as well as the project's <strong class="bold">Key</strong>, as you normally would. However, there's a twist to this: check the box for <strong class="bold">Share settings with an existing project</strong>, as shown in the preceding screenshot. </li>
				<li>Checking this box will give you access to a dropdown field. Click on that field and scroll down to select the project that you would like to base your new project on. For our example, we will select the <strong class="bold">Staff Meeting</strong> project. After that, click the <strong class="bold">Create project</strong> button to finish creating the project:<div><img src="img/Figure_9.5_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.5 – Create project&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.5 – Create project</p></li>
				<li>Once the project <a id="_idIndexMarker464"/>has been created, you will be dropped onto the project's new board, as we saw in <a href="B17952_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor047"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Your First Project</em>. Notice the name of the new project in the top breadcrumbs section. Also, notice that this looks just like the board that was created for our original <strong class="bold">Staff Meeting</strong> project:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.6_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.6 – Your new project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.6 – Your new project</p>
			<p>If we proceed to the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section of <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> for the <strong class="bold">Technology Monthly Meetings</strong> project, we will see that this new project uses the same schemes as the <strong class="bold">Staff Meeting</strong> project. In effect, these schemes have now become <strong class="bold">shared schemes</strong> because more than one project uses each of those schemes. The <a id="_idIndexMarker465"/>following screenshot shows the new project using the Staff Meeting project-related schemes:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.7_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.7 – Shared schemes&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.7 – Shared schemes</p>
			<p>Since creating<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> new projects in this manner is not available for those on a free plan, let's look at an alternative to achieve similar results. What we are about to see with shared schemes will work with any Jira Work Management, JSM, or Jira Software company-managed type of project. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-148"><a id="_idTextAnchor149"/>Using shared schemes</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Shared schemes</strong> are a great <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>way to bring consistency to projects in your organization and reduce the maintenance needs for your Jira administrators. Having multiple projects use a single shared scheme allows you to change the scheme once and have it automatically update all the connected projects. </p>
			<p>In my organization, we try to use shared schemes as often as possible. This might mean being a little creative with workflows to include statuses and transitions that use conditions based on the project's name or role. But once you have done that, it becomes easier the next time. </p>
			<p>Updating the schemes on a free plan project can achieve the same result as a <strong class="bold">shared project template</strong>; it will just take a few extra steps. Note that we can do this with most shared schemes for the free plan, except for the permission scheme. As we saw in the previous chapter, <a href="B17952_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring Permissions and Simple Administration</em>, you cannot modify the permission scheme for free subscriptions. </p>
			<p>So, how does<a id="_idIndexMarker468"/> this work? Let's take a look:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Once again, we begin by navigating to the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> area and then the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section. As shown in the following screenshot, you can click on any of the schemes to make a change:<div><img src="img/Figure_9.8_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.8 – Changing shared schemes&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.8 – Changing shared schemes</p></li>
				<li>Depending on which scheme you are looking to change, the process might be slightly different. For <strong class="bold">TECH: Project Management Issue Type Scheme</strong>, you will enter the scheme, then click the <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> button, and finally select <strong class="bold">Use a different scheme</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot. Then, you must select the scheme you want to use from the resulting list: <div><img src="img/Figure_9.9_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.9 – Issue Type Scheme&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.9 – Issue Type Scheme</p></li>
				<li>For <strong class="bold">TECH: Project Management Workflow Scheme</strong>, you must click on the <strong class="bold">Switch Scheme</strong> button and <a id="_idIndexMarker469"/>select the new scheme instead: <div><img src="img/Figure_9.10_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.10 – Workflow Scheme&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.10 – Workflow Scheme</p></li>
				<li>Again, for our example, we will use the Staff Meeting-related scheme:<div><img src="img/Figure_9.11_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.11 – Selecting a workflow scheme&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.11 – Selecting a workflow scheme</p></li>
				<li>For the new workflow<a id="_idIndexMarker470"/> scheme selection, you will be required to associate all the existing issues in your project with the new workflow(s). </li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that we know how to change our schemes so that we can share them, let's look at alternative ways we can create issues. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor150"/>Creating issues externally</h1>
			<p>As we have <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>mentioned previously, issues represent the work we do on our projects. They may manifest themselves as cards on a board or simply as a row in a list for the project. All of that tells us that issues are unique objects and belong to the project, not the list or the board. In other words, you do not create an issue on a board or a list – you create an issue against a project. </p>
			<p>We are not going to go into the details of each of the following methods, but this list is intended to give you a high-level familiarity with the possibilities. Where appropriate, we have added links to further details about each method. But suffice it to say that each of these processes will allow you to create issues on your project from outside of your JWM product:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Email</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker472"/> function will allow your users to create cards by simply sending an email to a prearranged email address in your organization. The sender of the email will be captured as the <em class="italic">Reporter</em>, the subject of the email will be the <em class="italic">Summary</em>, and the body of the email will be placed in<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> the <em class="italic">Description</em> field of the issue. See <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/create-issues-and-comments-from-email/">https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/create-issues-and-comments-from-email/</a> for more details. There are also free and paid apps in the Atlassian Marketplace to perform this process. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Slack</strong>: Slack<a id="_idIndexMarker474"/> is a favorite tool for many companies due to how easily internal chats can take place. Atlassian and Slack have teamed up to produce some excellent integration between the products, including the ability to create Jira issues from comments/discussions <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>inside of Slack. This requires a free app to be installed. See <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jira-slack-integration">https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/guides/expand-jira/jira-slack-integration</a> for more information. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Microsoft Teams</strong>: Very <a id="_idIndexMarker476"/>similar to the Slack integration, Microsoft and Atlassian have connected to bring you a free app to connect the two tools. Besides issue creation, you can display lists of Jira issues and/or boards directly in a <a id="_idIndexMarker477"/>Teams tab. See <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217836/microsoft-teams-for-jira?tab=overview&amp;hosting=cloud">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1217836/microsoft-teams-for-jira?tab=overview&amp;hosting=cloud</a> for more information. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">REST API call</strong>: Though <a id="_idIndexMarker478"/>more technical, this option will provide the most flexibility as to the amount of information that can be created in a new issue. It is strongly suggested that you have some type of development background to attempt this. See <a href="https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/creating-a-jira-cloud-issue-in-a-single-rest-call/">https://blog.developer.atlassian.com/creating-a-jira-cloud-issue-in-a-single-rest-call/</a> for more<a id="_idIndexMarker479"/> information.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>It is awesome to see so many ways to create<a id="_idIndexMarker480"/> issues for your JWM project. But what if you already have other projects in Jira and want to use JWM's features? Let's see how we can migrate those. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor151"/>Migrating existing Jira projects to Jira Work Management</h1>
			<p>As we outlined in our very first chapter, <a href="B17952_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Why Choose Jira Work Management?</em>, part of the target audience for this book is both those completely new to Jira and those who have used Jira before but are not familiar with the new JWM product. </p>
			<p>As such, some of you <a id="_idIndexMarker481"/>may already have existing projects that use other Jira project types. And now, having seen the new features and capabilities of JWM, perhaps you would like to move some of your projects over to the new product. Remember that you cannot simply convert project types – you must create a new project and migrate issues from the old project to the new project. </p>
			<p>If you have already done some project migrations before, this will not be anything new for you. But for those who have not, let's take a look. We will follow a basic flow that we will outline first and then add screenshots as we progress to reinforce the process:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="bold">Create a new JWM project</strong>: This can be any JWM project type you desire. Just use a template and off you go!</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map any existing custom fields in your project to the new project</strong>: In the <em class="italic">Custom fields</em> section of <a href="B17952_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Fields, Screens, and Issue Layouts</em>, we discussed how to modify the context of the custom field to add projects. You should do this for any custom fields on your existing non-JWM project to add the new JWM project you just created.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Add any custom fields to your JWM project screen</strong>: At this point, you must add these custom fields to the screen that will be used by your new JWM project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Execute a basic or advanced filter search</strong>: Execute a simple search, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 9.13</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Perform a bulk change to move the existing issues to the new project</strong>: Finally, bulk move the existing issues to the new project. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>For our example, we will move issues from the <strong class="bold">Staff Meeting</strong> project to the <strong class="bold">Technology Monthly Meetings</strong> project. First, click on the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> box in the top navigation bar:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.12_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.12 – The search box&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.12 – The search box</p>
			<p>At this point, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker482"/>do a basic search by changing the project on the far left to your existing project (Staff Meeting, for our example). Alternatively, you can click the <code>Project = STAFF</code>. Then, click <strong class="bold">Search</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.13_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.13 –Search and the Bulk change option&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.13 –Search and the Bulk change option</p>
			<p>Once you have a list of all the issues in the project, click the ellipsis menu (<strong class="bold">…</strong>) at the top right and select the <strong class="bold">Bulk change</strong> option. Select all of the issues, and then select <strong class="bold">Move</strong>: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_9.14_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 9.14 – Performing a bulk move&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 9.14 – Performing a bulk move</p>
			<p>Change the <strong class="bold">To</strong> project<a id="_idIndexMarker483"/> to your new JWM project, click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>, and then follow the prompts. When the migration is complete, all of your old project's issues will have been moved to your JWM project!</p>
			<p>Finally, we will learn how another Atlassian Marketplace app can help you be more productive. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor152"/>Working with Marketplace apps – Deep Clone for Jira</h1>
			<p>As we saw in <a href="B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes</em>, Atlassian Marketplace <a id="_idIndexMarker484"/>apps can bring some very helpful functionality to our JWM projects by extending the capabilities of the built-in tools. </p>
			<p>So, we will continue that spirit here with the Marketplace app called <strong class="bold">Deep Clone for Jira</strong>. Earlier, in the <em class="italic">Creating issues externally</em> section, we learned how to create issues outside of the <a id="_idIndexMarker485"/>normal <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button process. With Deep Clone, we can create issues by cloning existing issues.</p>
			<p>Jira has a built-in clone process, but it does not provide much flexibility. Namely, you can only clone an issue into the same project, and you cannot adjust any fields in the new issue during the cloning process. </p>
			<p>What sets Deep Clone apart is its ability to modify all the fields that are available in the create screen for the new issue, regardless of the project you are cloning into. So, you can clone an issue from Project A to Project B and modify the values of the fields in Project A so that they're different values in the new issue in Project B. You can also bulk clone issues, clone comments, subtasks, and even epics and their related children. Here's how to find more information on the app. </p>
			<p>Since Deep Clone<a id="_idIndexMarker486"/> can also clone multiple objects at the same time, it can be used to create several new issues of varying types (epics, stories, tasks, subtasks, and more) in a single process. This is perhaps the closest you can come to creating what could be considered a custom template (in addition to the standard out-of-the-box templates):</p>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor153"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned how to create a new project by utilizing the components of an existing project and how to achieve similar results using shared schemes. We also saw some alternative methods to creating issues from outside of Jira using various third-party applications and tools. </p>
			<p>Then, we learned how to migrate existing Jira projects into JWM projects to begin using JWM's features. Finally, we learned about the Deep Clone for Jira Marketplace app and how it can extend functionality by cloning issues into other projects and modifying fields in the process. </p>
			<p>With these new skills, you will be able to add flexibility to how you approach project and issue creation. This might eliminate the need for you to have to jump back and forth between applications to create issues. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to leverage the Automation for Jira tool to automate routine tasks and add power to our projects and issues.</p>
