    We can think of secrets as a generic term for the types of sensitive data that
    would typically be stored in config and ENV files, such as database access credentials
    or API tokens. Docker provides a handy method for securing this type of data and
    sharing it. For legacy systems using swarm mode instead of Kubernetes, having
    an understanding of how to apply security to these environments is important,
    as you may have to retroactively fix environments in your career.

    need to avoid attempts to store the secret in the container itself in a fashion

    only useful for managing different sets of credentials based upon the environment,
    but also provides an extra layer of security should the container be compromised

    simply called Docker secrets. In order to use this feature or the Kubernetes equivalent,
    you will need to implement swarm services or Kubernetes itself. As we have recommended
    elsewhere in this book, you may wish to avoid swarm services if possible, in favor
    of Kubernetes. However, you may have to work with legacy systems where they are
    in use, so understanding secrets in this case is important. With this in mind,
    containers should, therefore, run as a service.

    environments. For example, the passwords for database access in your development,
    staging, and production instances should not be the same. Typically, as part of
    your development process, you will likely be using newer versions of containers
    in research, development, and QA environments compared to production.

    set up for a development environment, we are also pulling in the right image as
    well; that is, the one we intended to use for development purposes with the development
    credentials we created. Using fixed tags provides a layer of security through
    immutability and prevents an experimental image that may contain security flaws

    indicate a backward-incompatible set of changes. A minor release is usually a
