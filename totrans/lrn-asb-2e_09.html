<h1 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor412"/>Moving to the Cloud</h1>
<p>This chapter will move from using our local virtual machine to using Ansible to launch instances with a public cloud provider.</p>
<p>For this chapter, we will be using Microsoft Azure, and we are targeting this provider as it allows us to launch virtual machines and interact with them without having too much configuration overhead.</p>
<p>We will then look at adapting our WordPress playbook to interact with the newly launched Microsoft Azure instance.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>An introduction to <a id="_idTextAnchor413"/>Microsoft Azure</li>
<li><a id="_idTextAnchor414"/>Launching instances in Microsoft Azure</li>
<li>Bootstrapping WordPress</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor415"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we will launch instances in a public cloud, so if you are following along, you will need a Microsoft Azure account. As with other chapters, complete versions of the playbooks can be found in the repository in the chapters folder at <a href="https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Ansible-Second-Edition/tree/main/Chapter09">https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learn-Ansible-Second-Edition/tree/main/Chapter09</a>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor416"/>An introduction to Microsoft Azure</h1>
<p>In 2008, Microsoft took its first significant step into cloud computing by introducing Windows Azure, a <a id="_idIndexMarker499"/>cloud-based data center service. This launch marked a pivotal moment in what many people saw as a traditional software company’s history, signaling a strategic shift toward cloud computing.</p>
<p>Developed under the internal project <em class="italic">Project Red Dog</em>, Windows Azure represented Microsoft’s answer to the growing demand for scalable, accessible, and flexible computing resources.</p>
<p>Windows Azure <a id="_idIndexMarker500"/>was initially rolled out with five core components, each designed to offer distinct capabilities within the cloud computing spectrum:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Microsoft SQL Data Services</strong>: This component offered a cloud version of Microsoft’s SQL database, simplifying<a id="_idIndexMarker501"/> the complexities associated with hosting and managing databases in a cloud environment.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Microsoft .NET Services</strong>: As <a id="_idIndexMarker502"/>a <strong class="bold">platform as a service</strong> (<strong class="bold">PaaS</strong>) offering, it enabled developers to <a id="_idIndexMarker503"/>deploy their .NET-based applications within a Microsoft-managed runtime, streamlining the development process.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Microsoft SharePoint</strong> and <strong class="bold">Microsoft Dynamics</strong>: These <strong class="bold">software as a service</strong> (<strong class="bold">SaaS</strong>) offerings <a id="_idIndexMarker504"/>provided cloud-based versions of the<a id="_idIndexMarker505"/> company’s<a id="_idIndexMarker506"/> renowned<a id="_idIndexMarker507"/> intranet and <strong class="bold">customer relationship management</strong> (<strong class="bold">CRM</strong>) products, enhancing collaboration and customer engagement.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Windows Azure (IaaS)</strong>: An <strong class="bold">infrastructure-as-a-service</strong> (<strong class="bold">IaaS</strong>) solution, this allowed users to create and <a id="_idIndexMarker508"/>control virtual machines, storage, and networking<a id="_idIndexMarker509"/> services, addressing diverse compute workloads.</li>
</ul>
<p>The preceding four definitions are from an older book I wrote, <em class="italic">Infrastructure as Code </em><em class="italic">for Beginners</em>.</p>
<p>Central to Windows Azure’s architecture was the Red Dog operating system, a specially modified version of Windows NT. This system was engineered to include a cloud layer, ensuring the smooth delivery of data center services.</p>
<p>By 2014, reflecting its expanded range of services and a growing emphasis on Linux-based workloads, Microsoft rebranded the service as Microsoft Azure. This change underscored the platform’s evolution beyond Windows-centric solutions.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2020, and it was evident that Microsoft Azure<a id="_idIndexMarker510"/> had embraced a more inclusive approach, with over half of its virtual machine cores and a significant number of Azure Marketplace images being Linux-based.</p>
<p>This shift demonstrated Microsoft’s broader adoption of Linux and open-source technologies, which remain integral to their current cloud service offerings at the time of writing.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor417"/>Launching instances in Microsoft Azure</h1>
<p>If you followed <a id="_idIndexMarker511"/>along in <a href="B21620_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor336"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Ansible Windows Modules</em>, you <a id="_idIndexMarker512"/>will have already launched a virtual machine in Microsoft Azure using the Azure CLI.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Reminder</p>
<p class="callout">For instructions on how to install and configure the Azure CLI, please see the documentation at <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli/">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli/</a>. Remember, if you are following along on a Windows host, then make sure to install the Azure CLI within your Windows Subsystem for Linux installation alongside where you installed Ansible.</p>
<p>When talking through launching the Windows virtual machine, we did the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>We created a resource group to collect all the resources for our virtual machine workload.</li>
<li>We then created a virtual network and subnet to attach to the machine’s network interface.</li>
<li>We then created a network security group to secure our virtual machine.</li>
<li>Once we had the basics, we launched a Windows virtual machine, attaching a public IP address directly to the network interface.</li>
<li>Finally, we deployed a virtual machine extension that executed the PowerShell script on our Windows host to enable the WinRM protocol, allowing us to connect<a id="_idIndexMarker513"/> to and interact with the host using <a id="_idIndexMarker514"/>Ansible.</li>
</ul>
<p>This chapter will repeat, tweak, and add to these steps using Ansible and the Azure collection of modules.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor418"/>Preparing Ansible for Microsoft Azure</h2>
<p>Before we dive into the<a id="_idIndexMarker515"/> Ansible role, which will launch our<a id="_idIndexMarker516"/> resources, we need to do a little preparation; first, let’s ensure that the Azure collection is installed by running the following:</p>
<pre class="console">
$ ansible-galaxy collection install azure.azcollection</pre> <p>Next, we must install the Python modules that allow the Azure collection to interact with the Azure APIs. To do this, we need to run the following command:</p>
<pre class="console">
$ pip3 install -r ~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/azure/azcollection/requirements-azure.txt</pre> <p>With the necessary supporting Python modules installed, the next step is to ensure that you have signed into your Microsoft Azure account using the Azure CLI. To do this, run the following command and follow the onscreen prompts:</p>
<pre class="console">
$ az login</pre> <p>If you have access to more than one Azure subscription using your account, you should ensure that the subscription you intend to launch your resources in is selected.</p>
<p>To do this, you can list all the subscriptions and, if needed, switch to the right subscription by running the following commands:</p>
<pre class="console">
$ az account list --output table
$ az account s<a id="_idTextAnchor419"/>et --subscription &lt;subscription_id&gt;</pre> <p>Ensure you<a id="_idIndexMarker517"/> replace <code>&lt;subscription_id&gt;</code> with the <a id="_idIndexMarker518"/>correct subscription ID from the <code>az account </code><code>list</code> command.</p>
<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
<p class="callout">Using the <code>az account set</code> command only applies to your current session; if you close your terminal window and reopen a new session, you must ensure you have changed subscriptions again.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor420"/>Reviewing the variables</h2>
<p>There are several variables<a id="_idIndexMarker519"/> across the roles we will use to deploy our Azure resources and configure WordPress. The first ones we will look at<a id="_idTextAnchor421"/> can be found in the <code>group_vars/common.yml</code> file.</p>
<p>To start with, we have some <code>debug_output</code>, outputs the contents of the variables <a id="_idIndexMarker520"/>that are registered during the playbook run; setting this to <code>true</code> is helpful to pull back information on the Azure resources once they have launched during the development of the role.</p>
<p>The second feature flag is <code>generate_key</code>; if this is set to <code>true</code>, then a private and public key pair will be created by Ansible if one does not exist at <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>.</p>
<p>The playbook will use the key in this location when launching a virtual machine, so one must exist, as without it, Ansible cannot connect to the newly launched virtual machine.</p>
<p>These two variables loo<a id="_idTextAnchor422"/>k like the following<a id="_idTextAnchor423"/>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
debug_output: false
genterate_key: false</pre> <p>Next, in <code>group_vars/common.yml</code>, we define some information about our <code>app</code> workload; this contains a mixture of details about the application and some of the Azure details like the Azure region the workload will be launched in (<code>location</code> and <code>location_short</code>) as well as the name that our WordPress site will be accessible on ( <code>public_dns_name</code>):</p>
<pre class="source-code">
app:
  name: "learnansible-wo<a id="_idTextAnchor424"/>rdpress"
  shortname: "ansiblewp"
  loc<a id="_idTextAnchor425"/>ation: "westeurope"
  location_short<a id="_idTextAnchor426"/>: "euw"
  env: "prod"
  public_dns_name: "learnansible"</pre> <p>The final set of variables, which are defined in the <code>group_vars/common.yml</code> file, are for the tags that will be applied to each Azure resource that Ansible will launch:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
common_tags:
  "project": "{{ app.name }}"
  "environment": "{{ app.env }}"
  "deployed_by": "ansible"</pre> <p>The next set of variables we will be using can be found in <code>roles/azure/defaults/main.yml</code>, which are used to deploy our resources.</p>
<p>The first block of <a id="_idIndexMarker521"/>variables defines a quick dictionary of Azure service names for use when it comes to naming our resources:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
dict:
  ansible_warning: "Resource managed by Ansible"
  load_balancer: "lb"
  network_interface: "nic"
  nsg: "nsg"
  private_endpoint: "pe"
  public_ip: "pip"
  resource_group: "rg"
  subnet: "snet"
  virtual_machine: "vm"
  virtualnetwork: "vnet"</pre> <p>Next, we define the <a id="_idIndexMarker522"/>resource names – as per <a href="B21620_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor336"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Ansible Windows Modules</em>, I am naming the resources as close to the cloud adoption framework recommendations as possible:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
load_balancer_name: "{{ dict.load_balancer }}-{{ app.name }}-{{app.env}}-{{ app.location_short }}"
load_balancer_public_ip_name: "{{ dict.public_ip }}-{{ load_balancer_name }}"
nsg_name: "{{ dict.nsg }}-{{ app.name }}-{{app.env}}-{{ app.location_short }}"
resource_group_name: "{{ dict.resource_group }}-{{ app.name }}-{{app.env}}-{{ app.location_short }}"
virtual_network_name: "{{ dict.virtualnetwork }}-{{ app.name }}-{{app.env}}-{{ app.location_short }}"
vm_name: "{{ dict.virtual_machine }}-admin-{{ app.name }}-{{app.env}}-{{ app.location_short }}"
vnet_name: "{{ dict.virtualnetwork }}-{{ app.name }}-{{app.env}}-{{ app.location_short }}"</pre> <p>Now that all the naming is out of the way, we can start defining the networking variables:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
vnet_config:
  cidr_block: "10.0.0.0/24"
  subnets:
    - {
        name: "{{ dict.subnet }}-vms-{{ app.name }}-{{app.env}}-{{ app.location_short }}",
        subnet: «10.0.0.0/27»,
        private: true,
        service_endpoints: «Microsoft.Storage»,
      }</pre> <p>Next, in networking, we have two lists of IPs – one is for fixed IPs, and the other is the IP address discovered <a id="_idTextAnchor427"/><a id="_idTextAnchor428"/>when the playbook ru<a id="_idTextAnchor429"/>ns:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
trusted_ips:
  - ""
dynamic_ips:
  - "{{ your_public_ip }}"</pre> <p>The next block of<a id="_idIndexMarker523"/> variables takes the preceding lists of IP addresses and uses them when creating the two network security group rule<a id="_idTextAnchor430"/>s:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
nsg_rules:
  - name: "allowHTTP"
    description: "{{ dict.ansible_warning }}"
    protocol: «Tcp»
    destination_port_range: «80»
    source_address_prefix: "*"
    access: "Allow"
    priority: "100"
    directi<a id="_idTextAnchor431"/>on: "Inbound"
  - name: "allowSSH"
    description: "{{ dict.ansible_warning }}"
    protocol: "Tcp"
    destination_port_range: «{{ load_balancer.ssh_port }}»
    source_address_prefix: "{{ trusted_ips|select() + dynamic_ips | unique }}"
    access: "Allow"
    priority: "150"
    direction: "Inbound"</pre> <p>As you can see, the first rule, <code>allowHTTP</code>, opens port <code>80</code> to the world; but <code>allowSSH</code> locks down the SSH port to the IP addresses in our two lists. To do this, we take the list of IP addresses in the <code>trusted_ips</code> variable, append the content of <code>dynamic_ips,</code> and then finally only display the unique items in the list so any duplicate entries are removed.</p>
<p>The final networking block defines the basics needed to launch Azure Load Balancer:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
load_balancer:
  ssh_port: "22"
  ssh_port_backend: "22"
  http_port: "80"
  http_port_backend: "80"</pre> <p>Now we have the <a id="_idIndexMarker524"/>virtual machine configuration:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
vm_config:
  admin_username: "adminuser"
  ssh_password_enabled: false
  vm_size: "Standard_B1ms"
  image:
    publisher: "Canonical"
    offer: "0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy"
    sku: "22_04-LTS"
    version: "latest"
  disk:
    managed_disk_type: "Premium_LRS"
    caching: "ReadWrite"
  key:
    path: "/home/adminuser/.ssh/authorized_keys"
    data: "{{ lookup('file', '~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub') }}"</pre> <p>Then, finally, just two<a id="_idIndexMarker525"/> variables that define the location and the host group of our newly launched virtual machine will be placed:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
location: "{{ app.location }}"
hosts_group: "vmgroup"</pre> <p>Now that we have covered all of the variables needed to launch our Azure resources, we can work through the tasks that do the actual work, all of which can be found in <code>roles/azure/tasks/main.yml</code>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor432"/>The resource group task</h2>
<p>The first task we are going to look at is <a id="_idIndexMarker526"/>creating the resource group where all of the other Azure resources are going to be placed:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Create the resource group"
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_resourcegroup:
    name: "{{ resource_group_name }}"
    location: "{{ location }}"
    tags: "{{ common_tags }}"
  register: "resource_group_output"</pre> <p>As you can see, there is not much to it; it takes the <code>name</code>, <code>location</code>, and <code>tags</code> variables we defined and creates the resource group using the <code>azure. collection.azure_rm_resourcegroup</code> module. The task output is then registered as a variable, allowing us to reuse the output in later tasks.</p>
<p>The next task prints the contents of the <code>resource_group_output</code> register variable on the screen if <code>debug_output</code> is set to <code>true</code>; if it is <code>false</code>, then the task is skipped:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Debug - Resource Group result"
  ansible.builtin.debug:
    var: "resource_group_output"
  when: debug_output</pre> <p>This is a common pattern throughout the Azure role, so we will not cover this task again. Assume that if the task registers its output, there is a supporting debug task immediately <a id="_idIndexMarker527"/>after. Now that we have our resource group, we can make a start on configuring the networking.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor433"/>The networking tasks</h2>
<p>The first task launches<a id="_idIndexMarker528"/> the virtual network, placing it in the resource group we just created:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Create the virtual network"
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_virtualnetwork:
    resource_group: "{{ resource_group_output.state.name }}"
    name: "{{ virtual_network_name }}"
    address_prefixes: "{{ vnet_config.cidr_block }}"
    tags: "{{ common_tags }}"
  register: "virtual_network_output"</pre> <p>As you can see, when referencing the resource group name, we use the registered output from the previous task by using <code>{{ resource_group_output.state.name }}</code>. Again, this is going to be a common thread throughout the remaining tasks.</p>
<p>Note, we are not defining the subnet as part of creating the virtual network; this is possible as we are only adding a single subnet, but it is considered best practice to use the <code>azure.collection.azure_rm_subnet</code> module to add subnets as this approach means that you can loop through adding subnets with a <code>with_items</code> statement:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Add the subnets to the virtual network"
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_subnet:
    resource_group: "{{ resource_group_output.state.name }}"
    name: "{{ item.name }}"
    address_prefix: "{{ item.subnet }}"
    virtual_network: "{{ virtual_network_output.state.name }}"
    service_endpoints:
      - service: "{{ item.service_endpoints }}"
  with_items: "{{ vnet_config.subnets }}"
  register: "subnet_output"</pre> <p>With the virtual network now populated with subnets, we can move on to creating the network security group.</p>
<p>As you may <a id="_idIndexMarker529"/>remember, when we looked at the variab<a id="_idTextAnchor434"/>les, we used a variable called <code>your_public_ip</code>, so our next task is to discover the external IP address of the host running Ansible using the <code>community.general.ipify_facts</code> module:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Find out your current public IP address using https://ipify.org/"
  community.general.ipify_facts:
  register: public_ip_output</pre> <p>As you can see, there is not much to this, but we are not registering a variable called <code>your_public_ip</code>; this is done as a separate task that uses the <code>ansible.builtin.set_fact</code> module:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Register your public ip as a fact"
  ansible.builtin.set_fact:
    your_public_ip: "{{ public_ip_output.ansible_facts.ipify_public_ip }}"</pre> <p>Now we know the IP address, we can create the network security group:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Create the network security group"
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_securitygroup:
    resource_group: "{{ resource_group_output.state.name }}"
    name: "{{ nsg_name }}"
    rules: "{{ nsg_rules }}"
    tags: "{{ common_tags }}"
  register: "nsg_output"</pre> <p>So far, so good; the <a id="_idIndexMarker530"/>next piece of networking configuration we need to do is to launch Azure Load Balancer. This is the first deviation from the resources we launched in <a href="B21620_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor336"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Ansible Windows Modules</em>, so why is that?</p>
<p>While Microsoft allows you to directly assign a public IP address to a virtual machine’s network interface in Azure, it is generally frowned upon and not considered best practice – having a networking resource such as Azure Load Balancer to route and distribute your traffic to one or more hosts is deemed to be more secure as you are putting a layer between the virtual machine and the public internet.</p>
<p>Also, having traffic pass through a load balancer, even when running a single virtual machine like ours, allows you to perform a basic health check to see whether the port to which the load balancer sends traffic is healthy.</p>
<p>The first task we need to run when launching Azure Load Balancer is to create a public IP address resource, which will be attached to the load balancer when we launch it:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Create the public IP address needed for the load balancer"
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_publicipaddress:
    resource_group: "{{ resource_group_output.state.name }}"
    allocation_method: "Static"
    name: "{{ load_balancer_public_ip_name }}"
    sku: "standard"
    domain_name: "{{ app.public_dns_name }}"
    tags: "{{ common_tags }}"
  register: "public_ip_output"</pre> <p>Now that the public IP address is defined, we can move on to Azure Load Balancer itself.</p>
<p>As there is rather a lot to the task, I will break it up a little as we go along:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Create load balancer using the public IP we created"
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_loadbalancer:
    resource_group: "{{ resource_group_output.state.name }}"
    name: "{{ load_balancer_name }}"
    sku: "Standard"</pre> <p>The next block in the task defines the front of the load balancer. This is where we attach the public IP address we just created:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    frontend_ip_configurations:
      - name: "{{ load_balancer_name }}-frontend-ip-config"
        public_ip_address: "{{ public_ip_output.state.name }}"</pre> <p>Next up, we<a id="_idIndexMarker531"/> define the backend pool. This is the pool where our virtual machine will be placed to have traffic sent to it. If we had more than one virtual machine, all of them would be addressed to the pool:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    backend_address_pools:
      - name: "{{ load_balancer_name }}-backend-address-pool"</pre> <p>Now we have the health probe, which probes the HTTP port on the backend pool to make sure that the virtual machines are ready to access traffic on port <code>80</code> by seeing if the port is open:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    probes:
      - name: "{{ load_balancer_name }}-http-probe"
        port: «{{ load_balancer.http_port_backend }}»
        fail_count: "3"
        protocol: "Tcp"</pre> <p>For our WordPress workload, we want our HTTP port to be exposed. To do this, we will create a load-balancing rule that allows you to create a one-to-many relationship with one or more virtual machines in the backend pool. This rule exposes the HTTP port on the load balancer and sends the traffic to the HTTP port on the backend virtual machines. If we had more than one virtual machine, the traffic would be evenly distributed<a id="_idIndexMarker532"/> across all hosts in the backend on the HTTP port:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    load_balancing_rules:
      - name: "{{ load_balancer_name }}-rule-http"
        frontend_ip_configuration: "{{ load_balancer_name }}-frontend-ip-config"
        backend_address_pool: "{{ load_balancer_name }}-backend-address-pool"
        frontend_port: «{{ load_balancer.http_port }}»
        backend_port: "{{ load_balancer.http_port_backend }}"
        probe: "{{ load_balancer_name }}-http-probe"</pre> <p>While a load balancing rule takes traffic from a single port on the frontend and distributes it across multiple virtual machines in <a id="_idIndexMarker533"/>the backend pool, an inbound <strong class="bold">NAT</strong> (which stands for <strong class="bold">Network Address Translation</strong>) rule distributes traffic on a one-to-one basis, which makes it perfect for services such as SSH that are not meant to be distributed across multiple hosts:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    inbound_nat_rules:
      - name: "{{ load_balancer_name }}-nat-ssh"
        frontend_ip_configuration: "{{ load_balancer_name }}-frontend-ip-config"
        backend_port: "{{ load_balancer.ssh_port }}"
        frontend_port: "{{ load_balancer.ssh_port }}"
        protocol: "Tcp"</pre> <p>If we were to have more than one machine, we would add more rules that take different ports and map them to port <code>22</code> on the backend virtual machines. Typically, I would use high ports such as <code>2220</code> &gt; <code>2229</code> so I don’t clash with over services – <code>2220</code> would send traffic to port <code>22</code> on the first machine and <code>2221</code> would do the same for the second machine, and so on.</p>
<p>However, in this example, we just have a single host, so I am mapping port <code>22</code> to port <code>22</code>.</p>
<p>Lastly, we will tag the resource and register the output:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    tags: "{{ common_tags }}"
  register: "load_balancer_output"</pre> <p>Now we have the load balancer, we need to create a network interface, which will be placed in the backend pool and attached to our virtual machine.</p>
<p>For those of you who have already looked at the Ansible Azure collection, you may have noticed a module called <code>azure.azcollection.azure_rm_networkinterface</code>, which is used to manage network interfaces. Hence, you’d assume that the task we will be looking at uses that. Well, you would be wrong.</p>
<p>While the pre-written module has pretty good feature parity with the API endpoint it interacts with, it is missing one key piece of functionality we require for our deployment: the ability to assign the network interface to a NAT rule.</p>
<p>However, all is<a id="_idIndexMarker534"/> not lost, and there is a workaround.</p>
<p>There is an Azure module whose only purpose is to interact with the Azure Resource Manager API directly, called <code>azure.collection.azure_rm_resource</code>, and by using this module, we can make an API call directly to the <code>Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces</code> endpoint from within Ansible.</p>
<p>Having the ability to do this for any of the Azure Resource Manager APIs is quite powerful as it opens new features as soon as Microsoft releases them, and it means you don’t have to wait for the Ansible Azure collection developers to write, test, and release the module.</p>
<p>It does come with one downside, though: using this method does add an additional layer of complexity to your playbook.</p>
<p>The following URL is the link to the REST API documentation, which covers the creation of a network interface: <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/virtualnetwork/network-interfaces/create-or-update?view=rest-virtualnetwork-2023-05-01&amp;tabs=HTTP">https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/virtualnetwork/network-interfaces/create-or-update?view=rest-virtualnetwork-2023-05-01&amp;tabs=HTTP</a>.</p>
<p>As we will see from working through the task, the general gist of what we are doing is constructing the URL of the API we would like to target and then constructing the request body detailed in the REST documentation.</p>
<p>To start with, let’s look at the part of the task that generates the URL:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Create the networ<a id="_idTextAnchor435"/>k interface for the wordpress vm"
  azure.<a id="_idTextAnchor436"/>azcollection.azure_rm_resource<a id="_idTextAnchor437"/>:
    api_version: "2023-05-01"
    resource_group: "{{ resou<a id="_idTextAnchor438"/>rce_group_output.state.n<a id="_idTextAnchor439"/>ame }}"
    prov<a id="_idTextAnchor440"/>ider: "network"
    res<a id="_idTextAnchor441"/>ource_type: "networkinterfaces"
    resource_name: "{{ dict.network_interface }}-{{ vm_name }}"
    idempotency: true</pre> <p>The preceding <a id="_idIndexMarker535"/>information constructs the URL given in the documentation, which is the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
PUT https:<a id="_idTextAnchor442"/>//management.azure.com/subscrip<a id="_idTextAnchor443"/>tions/{subscriptionId<a id="_idTextAnchor444"/>}/resourceGroups/{resourceGroupName}/provider<a id="_idTextAnchor445"/>s/Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/{networkInterfaceName}?api-version=2023-05-01</pre> <p>Let us look at how this is generated:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>{subscriptionId}</code> is automatically generated by the module, and we do not need to provide this information.</li>
<li><code>{resourceGroupName}</code> is added by providing the <code>resource_group</code> key, and as per the rest of the tasks, we are using the resource group name, which is the output of our registering the variable in the resource group task.</li>
<li>The providers are provided by us by filling in the <code>provider</code> and <code>resource_type</code> keys. Don’t worry – the URL is not case-sensitive, and the module adds the <code>Microsoft.</code> part for us.</li>
<li><code>{networkInterfaceName}</code> is the <code>resource_name</code> key.</li>
<li>Finally, the API version is provided by filling in the <code>api_version</code> key.</li>
</ul>
<p>The last part of the “header” does not form part of the URL, but instead, it instructs Ansible to perform a <code>GET</code> request and then compares the body of what will be posted to what is returned by the <code>GET</code> request, and if there are any problems, it will error before the body is posted.</p>
<p>Now that we have the URL of the Azure Resource Manager API endpoint to which we will send our request, we need to populate the body of the request.</p>
<p>For our case, this <a id="_idIndexMarker536"/>looks like the following code:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
    body:
      location: "{{ location }}"
      properties:
        enableAcceleratedNetworking: false
        primary: true
      <a id="_idTextAnchor446"/>  networksecuritygroup:
          id: "{{ nsg_output.state.id }}"
        configurations:
          - name: "{{ vm_name }}-ipcfg"
            properties:
              subnet:
                id: "{{ subnet_output.results[0].state.id }}"
              loadBalancerBackendAddressPools:
                - id: "{{ load_balancer_output.state.backend_address_pools[0].id }}"
              loadBalancerInboundNatRules:
                - id: "{{ load_balancer_output.state.inbound_nat_rules[0].id }}"
      tags: "{{ common_tags }}"</pre> <p>When the module runs, <code>properties</code> will be rendered as JSON and posted alongside <code>location</code> and <code>tags</code> in the request’s body, leaving the final part of the task to register the output:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
  register: "network_interface_output"</pre> <p>We now have all the base Azure configuration and resources in place; we can launch our virtual machine. As we will be using SSH to connect to the virtual machine and bootstrap our WordPress installation, we need to ensure we have a valid SSH key generated.</p>
<p>As we will connect to a remote virtual machine, we want to ship a test key as we have been doing on our locally deployed hosts. So, if there is not a key at <code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code> on your local machine, then set the <code>genterate_key</code> variable in the <code>group_vars/common.yml</code> file to <code>true</code> (it is <code>false</code> by default), then Ansible will generate the key for you.</p>
<p>Do not worry if a key <a id="_idIndexMarker537"/>already exists at that location; Ansible will only create a key if one does not exist:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Check user has a key, if not create one for {{ ansible_user_id }}"
  ansible.builtin.user:
    name: "{{ ansible_user_id }}"
    generate_ssh_key: true
    ssh_key_file: "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
  when: genterate_key</pre> <p>Next, we have the task that launches the virtual machine itself. It uses all of the resources we have already deployed and configured so I will not go into too much detail:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: Create the admin virtual machine
  azure.azcollection.azure_rm_virtualmachine:
    resource_group: "{{ resource_group_output.state.name }}"
    name: "{{ vm_name }}"
    admin_username: "{{ vm_config.admin_username }}"
    ssh_public_keys:
      - path: "{{ vm_config.key.path }}"
        key_data: "{{ vm_config.key.data }}"
    ssh_password_enabled: "{{ vm_config.ssh_password_enabled }}"
    vm_size: "{{ vm_config.vm_size }}"
    managed_disk_type: "{{ vm_config.disk.managed_disk_type }}"
    network_interfaces: "{{ network_interface_output.response.name }}"
    image:
      offer: "{{ vm_config.image.offer }}"
      publisher: "{{ vm_config.image.publisher }}"
      sku: "{{ vm_config.image.sku }}"
      version: «{{ vm_config.image.version }}»
    tags: «{{ common_tags }}»
  register: «vm_output»</pre> <p>As with most tasks we<a id="_idIndexMarker538"/> have run in this role, immediately after there is a debug task.</p>
<p>You may think, <em class="italic">“That’s the end of the role, right?”</em> but we have two tasks to cover.</p>
<p>The first of these final two tasks takes information about the hosts, such as the public IP address and SSH port, and then adds it to the host group defined as the <code>hosts_group</code> variable.</p>
<p>This means that there is no <a id="_idIndexMarker539"/>hardcoding of IP addresses or connections in our host’s inventory file. The task to register the host looks like the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: Add the Virtual Machine to the host group
  a<a id="_idTextAnchor447"/>nsible.builtin.add_host:
    groups: "{{ hosts_group }}"
    hostname: "{{ public_ip_output.state.ip_address }}-{{ load_balancer.ssh_port }}"
    ansible_host: "{{ public_ip_output.state.ip_address }}"
    ansible_port: «{{ load_balancer.ssh_port }}»</pre> <p>So, what could this task be? We have the networking in place, our virtual machine has been launched, and we have registered our host, so we must be ready to start bootstrapping WordPress.</p>
<p>That’s the problem; we might be ready, but the host we just launched might not be as it can sometimes take a minute or two for the virtual machine to finish booting up. If we were to immediately try and SSH into the host before it has finished booting, then our playbook would error and halt running.</p>
<p>Luckily, an Ansible module was developed for use in this scenario, <code>ansible.builtin.wait_for</code>:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Wait for the virtual machine to be ready"
  ansible.builtin.wait_for:
    host: "{{ public_ip_output.state.ip_address }}"
    port: «{{ load_balancer.ssh_port }}»
    delay: 10
    timeout: 300</pre> <p>This will wait for <code>10</code> seconds and then attempt to SSH to the host for up to 5 minutes (<code>300</code> seconds); when SSH is accessible, the Ansible playbook will then progress to the next set of roles, which, in our case, bootstrap WordPress.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor448"/>Bootstrapping WordPress</h1>
<p>It won’t be of any surprise to<a id="_idIndexMarker540"/> you that the bulk of the WordPress roles remain intact from our previous chapters so we will not cover those parts there and will instead review some of the small changes.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor449"/>The site and host environment files</h2>
<p>The <code>site.yml</code> is now split<a id="_idIndexMarker541"/> into two sections; the first runs locally and interacts with the Azure Resource Manager API to launch and configure the Azure resources:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Deploy and configure the Azure Environment"
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: true
  vars_files:
    - group_vars/common.yml
  roles:
    - "azure"</pre> <p>The second section targets the <code>vmgroup</code> host group and looks more like what we have been working with so far in the previous chapters:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Install and configure Wordpress"
  hosts: vmgroup
  gather_facts: true
  become: true
  become_method: "ansible.builtin.sudo"
  vars_files:
    - group_vars/common.yml
  roles:
    - "secrets"
    - "stack_install"
    - "stack_config"
    - "wordpress"</pre> <p>The <code>hosts</code> file looks like the <code>hosts</code> files<a id="_idIndexMarker542"/> we have been using throughout the previous chapters; it is just missing the lines where we explicitly define the target hosts and instead is just made up of the host groups’ definitions.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that we are adding a new role, and the remaining ones are mostly the same; the role is called <code>secrets</code>, so let’s see what it does.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor450"/>The secrets role</h2>
<p>The sole purpose of this role is to <a id="_idIndexMarker543"/>generate secure passwords for WordPress and the database. Its tasks are delegated to the loc<a id="_idTextAnchor451"/>al machine as it creates a variables file at <code>group_vars/secrets.yml</code> and loads them into the playbook run.</p>
<p>First, it checks if <code>group_vars/secrets.yml</code> already exists and if it does, we don’t want to change the contents of the file:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Check if the file secrets.yml exists"
  ansible.builtin.stat:
    path: "group_vars/secrets.yml"
  register: secrets_file
  delegate_to: "localhost"
  become: false</pre> <p>If there is no file, then it and its contents are generated from a template file:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
- name: "Generate the secrets.yml file using a template file if not exists"
  ansible.builtin.template:
    src: "secrets.yml.j2"
    dest: "group_vars/secrets.yml"
  when: secrets_file.stat.exists == false
  delegate_to: "localhost<a id="_idTextAnchor452"/>"
  become: false</pre> <p>The template file at <code>roles/secrets/templates/secrets.yml.j2</code> looks like the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
db_password: "{{ lookup('community.general.random_string', length=20, upper=true, special=false, numbers=true) }}" wp_password: "{{ lookup('community.general.random_string', length=20, upper=true, special=true, override_special="@-&amp;*", min_special=2, numbers=true) }}"</pre> <p>As you can see, it <a id="_idIndexMarker544"/>uses the <code>community.general.random_string</code> module to generate a random string with some sensible rules, which we will use as passwords.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor453"/>Other changes</h2>
<p>Most of the changes to the roles are to the variables; for example, in <code>roles/wordpress/defaults/main.yml</code> we have the following:</p>
<pre class="source-code">
wordpress:
  domain: "http://{{ app.public_dns_name }}.{{ app.location }}.cloudapp.azure.com/"
  password: "{{ wp_password }}"</pre> <p>This uses the public URL we are configuring on the Azure Load Balancer public IP address and the password variable from the <code>secrets</code> role that just ran.</p>
<p>Everything else in the roles remains as we left it in <a href="B21620_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying WordPress</em>.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor454"/>Running the playbook</h1>
<p>Running the playbook<a id="_idIndexMarker545"/> uses the same command we have been running throughout the book:</p>
<pre class="console">
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts site.yml</pre> <p>The playbook will execute and by the end of it you should see somethi<a id="_idTextAnchor455"/><a id="_idTextAnchor456"/>ng like the output on the following screen:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.1 – Running the playbook in a terminal" src="img/B21620_09_01.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.1 – Running the playbook in a terminal</p>
<p>Visiting the Azure portal at <a href="https://portal.azure.com/">https://portal.azure.com/</a> and viewing the resource group that Ansible created should show you something like the following:</p>
<div><div><img alt="Figure 9.2 – Viewing the resources in the Azure portal" src="img/B21620_09_02.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 9.2 – Viewing the resources in the Azure portal</p>
<p>From here, you should be able to enter the DNS name assigned on the public IP address; for example, in my instance, it was <code>http://learnansible.westeurope.cloudapp.azure.com/</code>. This may be different in your case and you should see your newly bootstrapped WordPress site.</p>
<p>Just like when we launched Azure resources in <a href="B21620_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor336"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Ansible Windows Modules</em>, to terminate the resources, we need to remove the resource group, which will remove all the resources contained there.</p>
<p>To do this using Ansible, there is a small, self-contained playbook called <code>destroy.yml</code>, which can be executed by running the following:</p>
<pre class="console">
$ ansible-playbook -i hosts destory.yml</pre> <p>This will take a few<a id="_idIndexMarker546"/> minutes to run, but it will remove all resources deployed in the <em class="italic">site.yml</em> playbook, including the ones in Azure and the <code>group_vars/secrets.yml</code> file, leaving you with a nice clean slate for when you next run the main <code>site.yml</code> playbook.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-147"><a id="_idTextAnchor457"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we launched our first instances in a public cloud using the Azure Ansible modules; as you have seen, the process was relatively straightforward, and we managed to securely launch the network and compute resource in Microsoft Azure, ready for us to then install WordPress on it without making any significant changes to the roles we covered in <a href="B21620_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor253"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying WordPress</em>.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will expand on some of the techniques we have covered in this chapter and return to networking, but unlike the previous chapter, where we covered networking devices, we will be looking at networking in public clouds.</p>
