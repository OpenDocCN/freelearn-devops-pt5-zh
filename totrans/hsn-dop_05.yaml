    and Internet of Things-based systems to accommodate huge data volumes, as they
    bring agility and scalability. DevOps is more prominent for cloud, to reproduce
    environments as replicas with configurations to be executed as code on par with
    software projects. In this chapter, we will discuss cloud computing terminology,
    architecture models, building blocks for service offerings such as platforms,
    infrastructures, and so on. We will also discuss the popular market vendors, and

    cloud computing technologies.

- en: Stateful servers maintain a user's state information in the form of sessions.
    Once a user logs into the website, a unique identifier is created and tracked
    by the web service for that session. The session information will be retained
    for all other requests by the user till the browser is closed; this session information
    helps to offer a personalized service to the user. The details of the sessions
    also help to monitor concurrent web traffic and incorporate security features,
    such as preventing a malicious user trying to flood the web server with multiple
    simultaneous requests through an established connection.
  prefs: []

- en: REST is a set of constraints that ensure a scalable, fault-tolerant, and easily
    extensible system adopted by the **World Wide Web** (**WWW**). A RESTful API can
    use other transfer protocols, such as SNMP, SMTP, and others. **HyperText Transfer
    Protocol** (**HTTP**) is a protocol used to link pages of hypertext in the WWW.
    This is also a popular way to transfer files apart from other transfer protocols
    available, such as FTP, gopher, and so on. RESTful APIs use HTTP as a transport
    layer in most scenarios, since the infrastructure, servers, and client libraries
    for HTTP are widely adopted. A RESTful API adheres to all the REST constraints,
    and an HTTP API makes use of HTTP as its transfer protocol, including SOAP APIs
    relaying on HTTP.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Working with REST APIs is like the navigation between websites. HTTP and HTTPs
    are two-key protocols used in implementations of REST APIs. A **Uniform Resource
    Identifier** (**URI**) is used as an address by the REST API to access a particular
    website. The URI is comprised of two parts--a **Uniform Resource Locator** (**URL**)
    and a **Uniform Resource Name** (**URN**). The URL represents the location of
    a specific resource on a computer network, and defines a mechanism for retrieving
    it. A URN is the name of a web resource.

    REST APIs are **JavaScript Object Notation** (**JSON**) and **eXtensible Markup
    Language** (**XML**). The advantage of JSON is that it's easier to parse, and
    hence more preferred to XML in most cases. While XML has some more advanced features
    in terms of result validation and navigation, it's more complex. Using `.json`
    at the end of the URI, JSON formatted output is delivered.
