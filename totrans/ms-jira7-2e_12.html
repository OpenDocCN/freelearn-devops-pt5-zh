For instance, you may want to auto-calculate a custom field value after a workflow transition. Using the <strong>ScriptRunner</strong> plugin, many such advanced configurations can be achieved. It comes with various built-in administration scripts, which give the administrators tremendous power to manage their instance. In this chapter, we will discuss the ScriptRunner add-on, along with the JIRA <strong>Command Line Interface</strong> (<strong>CLI</strong>) add-on, to perform various JIRA functions from the command line.</p><p>We will cover the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing ScriptRunner</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Installing CLI</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec76"/>Installing ScriptRunner</h1></div></div></div><p>Just like any other add-on, ScriptRunner can be installed from the JIRA administration interface. Perform these steps to install ScriptRunner on your JIRA instance:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Add-ons</strong> | <strong>Find new add-ons</strong> (under <strong>ATLASSIAN MARKETPLACE</strong>).</li><li class="listitem">In the search box, enter <code class="literal">ScriptRunner</code> and press the <em>Enter</em> key.

</p><div><img src="img/image_12_003.jpg" alt="Installing ScriptRunner"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>ScriptRunner will now be installed in your JIRA instance.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec102"/>Built-in scripts for administration</h2></div></div></div><p>The ScriptRunner add-on allows users to write and run their own scripts. It comes with plenty of nice scripts, which allow JIRA administrators to perform various activities that are otherwise difficult to perform using existing JIRA features, or not possible at all from the UI. Let's take a look at some of these scripts.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec42"/>Accessing built-in scripts</h3></div></div></div><p>To access scripts that come with the ScriptRunner add-on, perform these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Add-ons</strong> | <strong>Built-in Scripts</strong> (under <strong>SCRIPTRUNNER</strong>).</li><li class="listitem">In this section, the list of all the <strong>Built-in Scripts</strong> can be found:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_004.jpg" alt="Accessing built-in scripts"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on any of these links to run that particular built-in script. This will further ask you to enter parameters relevant for that script.</li></ol></div><p>Let's take a look at some of these built-in scripts.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec20"/>Copy project</h4></div></div></div><p>Only JIRA administrators have the permission to create a project in JIRA (and change the configurations, too). Whenever there is a need to have an additional project in JIRA, the administrator needs to manually create projects and then change their schemes. It's not a difficult task, and usually takes only 10 minutes, but sometimes there is a need to create ten projects, and creating them manually could take hours.</p><p>There is a built-in script in ScriptRunner to copy the project along with its configurations, with or without its issues. Perform these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Copy project</strong> link:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_005.jpg" alt="Copy project"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, select <strong>cursor</strong> as <strong>Source project</strong>, enter <strong>Target project key</strong> and <strong>Target project name</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Check the <strong>Copy versions</strong> and <strong>Copy components</strong> checkbox if you want to copy the project versions and project components as well.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Run</strong> button to initiate the <strong>Copy project</strong> script:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_006.jpg" alt="Copy project"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Once done, the message is displayed at the bottom of the screen stating that the project has been copied, with a link to the new project. If you check the new copied project, you will notice that it has all the configurations of the source project. This tool takes less than a minute to run and JIRA administrators can save a lot of time using it.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec21"/>Escalation service</h4></div></div></div><p>This is an excellent built-in script that helps JIRA administrators perform periodic actions on a certain set of issues. Let's take the example of a support ticket configuration, in which we have a workflow state called <strong>Waiting for Client</strong> in our project. This is used to signify that further information is required from a client to act further on a ticket. These issues need to be resolved automatically if the ticket has not been updated in the past two weeks:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Escalation service</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_007.jpg" alt="Escalation service"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>New Service</strong> to create a new service:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_008.jpg" alt="Escalation service"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Enter <code class="literal">No updates in 2 weeks</code> as <strong>Description</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">In <strong>JQL Query</strong>, enter <code class="literal">status="Waiting for Client" AND updated &gt;= -14d</code>.</li><li class="listitem">Enter your <strong>User Key</strong> and specify <strong>Interval/CRON Expression</strong> as <code class="literal">1440</code>, which is 24 hours. In the <strong>Action</strong> dropdown, all the workflow states for all the projects in your instances will be displayed. Select the workflow transition that you want to perform as per your project. For instance, you can select <strong>Close Issue (2)</strong>.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="note24"/>Note</h3><p>As we want to close the issues that qualify under the criteria in JQL Query, in the <strong>Additional issue actions</strong> field, enter the code <code class="literal">issueInputParameters.setResolutionId('1')</code>.</p><p>You can also do this by clicking on <strong>Expand examples</strong> and selecting the <strong>Set resolution to Fixed</strong> link.</p></div></div></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Add Service</strong> button to save this service:</li></ol></div><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_009.jpg" alt="Escalation service"/></div><p>
</p><p>Now, we have a service added that will run after every 24-hour period and will resolve the issues that were not updated in the past 14 days, that is, two weeks.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec22"/>Switching to a different user</h4></div></div></div><p>Imagine a situation when a user reports some problem in JIRA. As a JIRA administrator, you need to log in with their ID to understand the problem this user might be facing. You can either ask this user for their password or create a similar user with the same set of permissions. Instead, wouldn't it be better to be able to log in to JIRA using that user's username without asking for the password? There is a built-in script to perform just that:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on <strong>Switch to a different user</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Enter the <strong>User ID</strong> of the user and click on the <strong>Run</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_010.jpg" alt="Switching to a different user"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>here</strong> link that appears at the bottom of the screen. You will then be logged in as a different user:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_011.jpg" alt="Switching to a different user"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>This script is one of my favorites because I can log in with any username I want without asking for the user's password. It also saves a lot of time.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec103"/>Modifying the JIRA workflow with conditions, validators, and post functions</h2></div></div></div><p>The best part of the ScriptRunner add-on is the additional features it brings in the JIRA workflow. Out of the box, there are various conditions, validators, and post functions that can be configured in the workflow, but it offers limited functionalities. ScriptRunner simply gives you more options, which you can control in the workflow. Let's take a look at them.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec43"/>Conditions</h3></div></div></div><p>ScriptRunner brings a set of additional conditions that you can add in the workflow; it gives you amazing control over a lot of things, which was not previously possible. Perform these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Modify the workflow of your choice. For any transition, navigate to the <strong>Conditions</strong> tab and then click on the <strong>Add condition</strong> link.</li><li class="listitem">You will find a new condition called <strong>Script Condition</strong>; just select it and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_012.jpg" alt="Conditions"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, you will get a list of scripts that you can add as a workflow condition:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_013.jpg" alt="Conditions"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Let's discuss some of these scripts.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec23"/>All sub-tasks must be resolved</h4></div></div></div><p>If you want all the sub-tasks of a particular issue to be resolved with a specific resolution, the following condition can be added:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_014.jpg" alt="All sub-tasks must be resolved"/></div><p>
</p><p>Simply select the <strong>Resolution</strong> that you want your sub-tasks to have after moving them to the <strong>Resolved</strong> state and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec24"/>Allowing the transition if this query matches a JQL query</h4></div></div></div><p>While performing a workflow transition, you can use a custom JQL in the workflow condition and allow the transition only when that JQL returns the issue that you will transition:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_015.jpg" alt="Allowing the transition if this query matches a JQL query"/></div><p>
</p><p>For instance, if you want the transition to happen only when the assignee of the issue is the currently logged-in user and the due date of the issue is today, in the <strong>JQL Query</strong> field add the <code class="literal">assignee = currentUser() and due = now()</code> query and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button. Optionally, you can also enter the specific issue ID to preview this condition.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec25"/>Checks the issue has been in a status previously</h4></div></div></div><p>The workflow can have numerous states and transitions between them. A workflow state can have more than one transition. If for some reason you want the transition to be made from a particular state only, the following condition can be added:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_016.jpg" alt="Checks the issue has been in a status previously"/></div><p>
</p><p>Just select <strong>In Progress</strong> from the drop-down list for <strong>Previous Status</strong> and check whether this status has to be <strong>Immediately previous only</strong>, or uncheck this option if it could be any other previous status, and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec26"/>Simple scripted condition</h4></div></div></div><p>ScriptRunner has some ready-made simple scripts that can be added quickly as a condition:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_017.jpg" alt="Simple scripted condition"/></div><p>
</p><p>Just click on any of the example links and it can be added as a condition. For instance, I added a condition that will check whether one of the issue attachments is a PDF file or not. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button to continue.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec44"/>Validators</h3></div></div></div><p>Just like additional conditions, ScriptRunner brings a set of additional validators that you can add to the workflow; it gives you amazing control over lots of things that were not previously possible. Perform these following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Modify the workflow of your choice and for any transition, navigate to the <strong>Validators</strong> tab and then click on the <strong>Add validator</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">You will find a new validator called <strong>Script Validator</strong>. Just select it and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_018.jpg" alt="Validators"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, you will get a list of scripts that you can add as a workflow validator:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_019.jpg" alt="Validators"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Let's discuss some of these scripts.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec27"/>Field(s) changed validator</h4></div></div></div><p>It's possible that you will use a transition view in the workflow transition that pops up a window to the user to capture additional input. These transition views are nothing but a screen containing one or more fields. Use this validator to validate whether those fields present in the transition view have changed:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_020.jpg" alt="Field(s) changed validator"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select all the <strong>Fields</strong> that you want to check for changes and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button. The fields visible here are only the ones that are part of the transition view for the transition you are working on in the workflow.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec28"/>Require a comment on transition</h4></div></div></div><p>In the transition view, there is usually a comment field as well. Use this validator to validate whether a comment has been added or not:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_021.jpg" alt="Require a comment on transition"/></div><p>
</p><p>This validator doesn't require any parameters to configure. Just click on the <strong>Add</strong> button.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec29"/>Simple scripted validator</h4></div></div></div><p>ScriptRunner has some ready-made simple scripts that can be added quickly as validators:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_022.jpg" alt="Simple scripted validator"/></div><p>
</p><p>Just click on any of the example links and it can be added as a validator. For instance, if you want to enforce that the issue should have at least four subtasks, then click on <strong>Has greater than two subtasks</strong> and modify <strong>Condition</strong> from <code class="literal">2</code> to <code class="literal">4</code> so that it becomes <code class="literal">issue.subTasks.size() &gt; 4</code>. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button to continue.</p></div></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec45"/>Post functions</h3></div></div></div><p>Just like additional conditions and validators, ScriptRunner brings a set of additional post functions that you can add in the workflow; this gives you amazing control over a lot of things that were not previously possible. Perform these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Modify the workflow of your choice and for any transition, navigate to the <strong>Post Functions</strong> tab and then click on the <strong>Add post function</strong> link.</li><li class="listitem">You will find a new post function called <strong>Script Post-Function</strong>; just select it and click on the <strong>Add</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_023.jpg" alt="Post functions"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen, you will get a list of scripts that you can add as a workflow post function:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_024.jpg" alt="Post functions"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Let's discuss some of these scripts.</p><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec30"/>Adds the current user as a watcher</h4></div></div></div><p>Consider a scenario when the priority of the issue is <strong>Major</strong> and the user who is currently logged in and making the workflow transition should be added as a watcher of the issue; in this case, use the following post function:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_025.jpg" alt="Adds the current user as a watcher"/></div><p>
</p><p>From the list of examples, click on the <strong>Priority is Major</strong> link and a condition will be added. Now, whenever this condition is true during the workflow transition, the post function will be executed. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button to add the post function.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl4sec31"/>Transition parent when all subtasks are resolved</h4></div></div></div><p>If your issue has a lot of subtasks, it's possible to move the parent to a new state in the workflow when all its subtasks are resolved:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_12_026.jpg" alt="Transition parent when all subtasks are resolved"/></div><p>
</p><p>Select <strong>Parent action</strong> as <strong>Done (41)</strong> and <strong>Resolution</strong> as <strong>Done</strong>. Click on the <strong>Add</strong> button to add the post function. This is particularly useful in Scrum boards, when you are to change the state of the story when all of its subtasks are resolved.</p><p>There are numerous other post functions that can be used in the workflow. Using the ScriptRunner add-on, a lot of flexibility and control can be added in the workflow to perform actions that were not possible earlier.</p></div></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl2sec104"/>Accessing powerful JQL functions</h2></div></div></div><p>We have already discussed searching issues in JIRA with the <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Advanced</strong> search options using JQL. However, JQL has some limitations. JIRA administrators often try to fetch the information directly from the database, which is difficult to do because it requires a good knowledge of the JIRA database schema.</p><p>ScriptRunner introduces new JQL functions. You can use these functions in your instance. After installing this add-on, just perform the re-indexing to enable the new JQL functions.</p><p>Let's discuss some of these JQL functions.</p><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec46"/>Returning issues with number of comments</h3></div></div></div><p>Use the following JQL queries to return issues with the exact number of comments:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>issueFunction in hasComments(3)</strong>
</pre><p>The following query will return an issue with more than four comments:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>issueFunction in hasComments('+5')</strong>
</pre></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec47"/>Returning issues based on comment attributes</h3></div></div></div><p>Use the following query to return issues commented on by project role administrators:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>issueFunction in commented("role Administrators")</strong>
</pre><p>This query returns issues with comments from a specific user in the past seven days:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>issueFunction in commented("after -7d by ravisagar")    </strong>
</pre></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec48"/>Returning issues based on attachments</h3></div></div></div><p>Use the following query to fetch issues with a PDF as an attachment:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>issueFunction in hasAttachments ("pdf")</strong>
</pre><p>This query finds issues in the file that were attached by a specific user in the past seven days:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>issueFunction in fileAttached("after -7d by ravisagar")</strong>
</pre></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl3sec49"/>Comparing dates</h3></div></div></div><p>Issues can also be fetched by comparing their date fields, such as <strong>Resolution Date</strong> and <strong>Due Date</strong>.</p><p>Use this query to return issues that were resolved later than their due date:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>issueFunction in dateCompare("", "resolutionDate &gt; dueDate")</strong>
</pre><p>The following query finds issues that were resolved within one week of their creation:</p><pre class="programlisting">
<strong>issueFunction in dateCompare("", "created +1w &gt; resolutionDate ")</strong>
</pre><p>These are just some of the examples of additional JQL functions that you can use. For the full list, I recommend you refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://jamieechlin.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GRV/Scripted+JQL+Functions">https://jamieechlin.atlassian.net/wiki/display/GRV/Scripted+JQL+Functions</a>.</p><p>ScriptRunner is, personally, my favorite add-on, which I use with all of the JIRA instances that I manage. It just gives so much power and control to effectively manage various administrative tasks in JIRA. Apart from various built-in scripts, which give administrators access to ready-to-use features, one can also write one's own script and use it to perform more advanced and complex tasks. This ability to write scripts opens up a lot of possibilities to enhance the workflow and to add more features in JIRA without developing an add-on.</p></div></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec77"/>Installing JIRA CLI</h1></div></div></div><p>Just like any other add-on, Atlassian CLI can be installed from the JIRA <strong>Administration</strong> interface. Perform these steps to install it on your JIRA instance:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Add-ons</strong> | <strong>Find new add-ons</strong> (under <strong>ATLASSIAN MARKETPLACE</strong>).</li><li class="listitem">In the search box, enter <code class="literal">Atlassian Command Line Interface</code> and press the <em>Enter</em> key.

</p><p>These are some of the examples of JIRA CLI. It is very powerful as these commands can be invoked by any script. It also opens up a wide range of possibilities, not only to JIRA administrators, but also to developers who want to integrate with JIRA.

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch12lvl1sec78"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we discussed ScriptRunner, which is an amazing add-on for performing complex customizations in the workflow, accessing powerful JQL functions, and running various scripts, which can be used by JIRA administrators to maintain the instance efficiently. ScriptRunner is by far the most popular admin tool used by JIRA administrators.</p><p>In the following chapter, we will discuss how to access the JIRA database directly to fetch data. JIRA offers lots of good reports, but sometimes they are not good enough and more insight is required. If you know the JIRA database schema and how to access the database, any data can be retrieved for further reporting purposes.</p></div></body></html>
