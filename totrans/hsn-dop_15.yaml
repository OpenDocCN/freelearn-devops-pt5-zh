- en: JDK 8 is a superset of JRE 8, and contains everything that is in JRE 8, plus
    tools such as the compilers and debuggers necessary for developing applets and
    applications. JRE 8 provides the libraries, the **Java Virtual Machine** (**JVM**),
    and other components to run applets and applications written in the Java programming
    language. Note that the JRE includes components not required by the Java SE specification,
    including both standard and non-standard Java components.
