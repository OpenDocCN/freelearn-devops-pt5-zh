    we will explore security requirements and compliance in this chapter. We all agree
    that security and privacy are essential to software release. However, it can be
    a challenge for a product manager to plan security or privacy features into product
    releases.

    the security requirements for each release quality gate, the security requirements
    for general web applications, the security requirements for big data, and the
    security requirements for compliance with **General Data Protection Regulation**
    (**GDPR**). Some security requirements are engineering-driven, such as release
    gates, and some are marketing-driven, such as GDPR. This chapter provides security
    requirements planning guidelines by looking into different angles of security

- en: It's important to set up security quality criteria for each release stage, such
    as threat modeling, design, coding, testing, and deployment. The objective of
    the release gate is to improve the quality of security releases in each stage.
    When you start defining release gates, it's suggested to start with a few major
    or high-priority security issues, since a long checklist will result not only
    in overhead but also in resistance from the development or QA teams.

    become familiar with the security practices, and also to make mistakes. Try to

    evaluates the required network, or host modification for a successful exploitation
    such as privileges, user interaction, integrity, availability and confidentiality. These

    features for coming releases, a development team refers to ASVS for the right
    implementation of a secure application, and a QA team uses it as a checklist to
    evaluate the application, or as release gate. Customize the ASVS checklist and
    build the checklist into your security practices to make it more effective. For
    example, make the security requirements baseline part of product feature-planning
    templates, or list a security check as the release gate in the process. After
    all, we don't expect the ASVS will be just a checklist document. It takes awareness,
    process, and consensus to make it into practice.

    the attributes (purpose, ways of the collection, storage, format, retention period
    and so on.) will help to determine and review how to handle the privacy data.
    For example, some of the privacy data may be identified not a must to collect
    or no legal basis for collection,  and the privacy data should never be collected.
