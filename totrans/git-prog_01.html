    <h1 id="_idParaDest-13" class="chapterTitle">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">A very brief history of version control and Git</li>
      <li class="bullet">Getting and setting up Visual Studio 2019, GitHub Desktop, and your terminal</li>
      <li class="bullet">Getting and installing Git</li>
      <li class="bullet">Configuring Git for Visual Studio, GitHub Desktop, and GitHub at the command line</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="normal">Let's get started!</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-14" class="title">About this book</h1>
    <blockquote class="packt_quote">"Begin at the beginning," the King said gravely, "and go on till you come to the end, then stop." – Alice in Wonderland</blockquote>
    <p class="normal">In this book, we will cover Git from the very beginning all the way through to advanced topics. No experience with Git is expected. Though if you have been using Git, you'll probably want to skim the initial chapters. Git is arguably the most popular version control system in the world, but this raises the question: "What is version control?"</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-15" class="title">Version control</h1>
    <p class="normal">Before version control, I would code a bit and then when I became afraid of losing that code, I would make a backup of my directory. This is slow, inefficient, takes up a lot of disk space, and is very hard to share with others.</p>
    <p class="normal">A <strong class="keyword">Version Control System</strong> (<strong class="keyword">VCS</strong>) does all this work for you (and more) and does so in a way that is fast, efficient, and takes up a minimum of disk space. One of the fastest and most efficient is Git, although there are others. This book will not spend a lot of time convincing you that Git is better than the others. First, the market has spoken, and Git prevails. Second, if you've purchased this book, you've already decided. And if you haven't already purchased this book, go do so. I'll wait here.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-16" class="title">About the code examples</h1>
    <p class="normal">In order to demonstrate the use of Git, we need to have a small program that we can evolve. The code examples are given in C#, but they are so simple that you'll be able to follow them regardless of your experience with the language. For example, if you can figure out what this does, you're all set.</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public class Program
{
    public void PrintHello()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This code declares a class (don't worry about what that is) named <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Program</code>. Inside that class is a method (function) called <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">PrintHello</code> that prints <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Hello World</code> to the console (your screen).</p>
    <p class="normal">This is about as complex as it gets, and I'll explain each code snippet as we go.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-17" class="title">Just a brief history</h1>
    <p class="normal">In July of 2005, after just a few month's work, Linus Torvalds, the genius behind Linux, released Git to meet his own needs, the needs of the Linux community, and eventually, the rest of us. The goal of Git was to be fast and efficient. It succeeded. </p>
    <p class="normal">While most VCSes at the time were centralized (all the files were kept on a big server), Git uses a distributed system, in which everyone has their own repository. Technically, no central server is required for Git, although if you are working in a team, a central place for sharing code is convenient. But the huge difference is that with Git, the vast majority of your interactions with the VCS are local – right there on your disk.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-18" class="title">Tools for working with Git</h1>
    <p class="normal">There are a number of easily <a id="_idIndexMarker000"/>confused terms (such as Git versus GitHub) and there are many tools for working with Git – from the command line to <strong class="keyword">Graphical User Interface</strong> (<strong class="keyword">GUI</strong>) tools. This section will review some of these options.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-19" class="title">GitHub, et al.</h2>
    <p class="normal">There are many services <a id="_idIndexMarker001"/>that allow you to create shared "repositories" (the location of all the versions of your program). The most famous and popular are <a id="_idIndexMarker002"/>GitHub and Microsoft's Azure, as well as BitBucket and GitLab. Azure is a very powerful system for DevOps, while GitHub is a very straightforward way to host your program. We'll be using GitHub in this book. (Recently, Microsoft acquired GitHub for $7.5 billion in stock – and made a huge commitment to GitHub, open source and, of course, to Git.)</p>
    <div><p class="Information-Box--PACKT-"><strong class="screenText">Key point</strong>: Git is the system we're covering in this book. GitHub is a central repository system for sharing code (we'll make this more specific later in the book) and GitHub Desktop is a GUI for working with Git.</p>
    </div>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-20" class="title">GUIs and the command line</h2>
    <p class="normal">There are many <a id="_idIndexMarker003"/>ways in which to interact with Git. The <a id="_idIndexMarker004"/>principal ones are to work at the command line or to <a id="_idIndexMarker005"/>use a GUI. There are a wide number of GUIs. This <a id="_idIndexMarker006"/>book will focus on GitHub for Desktop and Visual Studio 2019, as well as the command line. In fact, one of the things that makes this book different is that all of Git will be explained using these three tools. This will give you a deep understanding of Git along with how the GUIs can help (and can hinder) your work.</p>
    <p class="normal">There are many other excellent GUI tools, and the ecosystem of tools keeps evolving. That said, the ones we will use are both powerful and representative of what you get with nearly all the other GUI tools. In addition, these tools are well established and likely to stick around. Furthermore, if you learn one GUI and see how it relates to command-line instructions, you'll find it easy to use other GUIs.</p>
    <p class="normal">We will look first at the command-line interface to Git. While there are some limitations in GUI tools, if it can be <a id="_idIndexMarker007"/>done with Git, it can be done at the <a id="_idIndexMarker008"/>command line, that is, all of Git's functionality is <a id="_idIndexMarker009"/>exposed at the command line. Furthermore, as has <a id="_idIndexMarker010"/>often been pointed out, understanding Git at the command line will make your use of a GUI much easier as you will know what is actually happening. </p>
    <p class="normal">Does it help to understand how your car works? Not at all, until something goes wrong. Then you turn to the expert mechanic who can fix the problem. In Git, the expert is the programmer who knows the command line.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-21" class="title">The command line</h2>
    <p class="normal">Out of the box, on <a id="_idIndexMarker011"/>Windows 10, the command line is available straight from <a id="_idIndexMarker012"/>your terminal. It gives you everything you need, but it is a bit ugly:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_01_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.1: Git at the command line</p>
    <p class="normal">It is hard to read, but we can make it pretty, so that it's easier on the eye.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-22" class="title">Making the command line pretty</h2>
    <p class="normal">If you are using <a id="_idIndexMarker013"/>Git on Windows 10, you can make the command line prettier and more useful, as shown here:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_01_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.2: Example of Pretty Print</p>
    <p class="normal">To do this, download and install Power Shell. Then, follow Scott Hanselman's excellent directions at <a href="http://jliberty.me/PrettyGit">http://jliberty.me/PrettyGit</a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">A similar effect can be had on mac and Linux by following the directions at <a href="https://github.com/diogocavilha/fancy-git">https://github.com/diogocavilha/fancy-git</a>. There are other options available on the GitHub site that do pretty much the same thing.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-23" class="title">Visual Studio 2019</h2>
    <p class="normal">Visual Studio 2019 has <a id="_idIndexMarker014"/>extensive support for Git built in. There is a <a id="_idIndexMarker015"/>separate menu specifically designed for Git, and Git information is integrated into the general UI:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_01_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.3: Git menu in Visual Studio 2019</p>
    <p class="normal">The first <a id="_idIndexMarker016"/>order of <a id="_idIndexMarker017"/>business is to get and set up Visual Studio.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-24" class="title">Getting Visual Studio for free</h2>
    <p class="normal">All three of the <a id="_idIndexMarker018"/>products used for illustration purposes in this book (the command line, Visual Studio 2019, and GitHub Desktop) have free versions available. To obtain your copy of Visual Studio 2019, go to <a href="http://visualstudio.com">http://visualstudio.com</a> and hover over the <strong class="screenText">Visual Studio</strong> button. Select <strong class="screenText">Community 2019</strong>. It will download and all you have to do is double-click on it and follow the instructions:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_01_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.4: Obtaining Visual Studio</p>
    <p class="normal">If you are using a Mac, there are <a id="_idIndexMarker019"/>some significant differences between how Visual Studio 2019 for Windows handles Git and how Visual Studio for Mac does. You will probably have no trouble following along, but you can always use the Terminal or GitHub Desktop.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-25" class="title">GitHub Desktop</h2>
    <p class="normal">A very <a id="_idIndexMarker020"/>popular GUI, especially <a id="_idIndexMarker021"/>for use with GitHub, is GitHub Desktop. This cross-platform application makes working with Git extremely easy: anticipating what you might want to do and making that simple. The downside is that there are limitations, as there are for virtually every GUI.</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_01_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.5: GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">We will be using all three of <a id="_idIndexMarker022"/>these <a id="_idIndexMarker023"/>throughout the book: command line, Visual Studio 2019, and GitHub Desktop. As we proceed, the selections and Git commands shown above will make much more sense; for now, just get a feel for their appearance.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-26" class="title">Getting Git</h1>
    <p class="normal">The very first thing you <a id="_idIndexMarker024"/>need to do is to install Git on your computer. The official Git site states that "even if Git is already installed on your computer, it is probably a good idea to reinstall to update to the latest version."</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-27" class="title">Getting Git on Windows</h2>
    <p class="normal">There are also a few <a id="_idIndexMarker025"/>ways in <a id="_idIndexMarker026"/>which to install Git on Windows. I recommend using the official build. The most recent one is available from the Git website: <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/win">https://git-scm.com/download/win</a>.</p>
    <p class="normal">Another way to get Git, and to kill two birds with one stone, is to download and install GitHub Desktop. The installer will also install a <a id="_idIndexMarker027"/>command-line version of Git. You can get it at <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">https://desktop.github.com/</a>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_01_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.6: Obtaining GitHub Desktop</p>
    <p class="normal">This book <a id="_idIndexMarker028"/>will show its <a id="_idIndexMarker029"/>demonstrations on Windows 10, using Git version 2.30.0.windows.2, but the examples should work with just about any version of Git.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-28" class="title">Getting Git on a Mac</h2>
    <p class="normal">There are several <a id="_idIndexMarker030"/>ways to <a id="_idIndexMarker031"/>install Git on a Mac. The easiest is probably to install the Xcode command-line tools. You can do this by trying to run Git from the Terminal the very first time, as follows:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">$ Git --version
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">If you don't have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you want a more up-to-date version, you can also install it via a binary installer. A macOS Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website at <a href="https://git-scm.com/download/mac">https://git-scm.com/download/mac</a>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_01_07.png" alt="Git macOS installer"/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.7: Getting Git on a Mac</p>
    <p class="normal">You can also <a id="_idIndexMarker032"/>install it as <a id="_idIndexMarker033"/>part of the GitHub Desktop for macOS install. Their GUI Git tool also has an option to install command-line tools. You can download that tool from the GitHub Desktop for macOS website at <a href="https://desktop.github.com">https://desktop.github.com</a>.</p>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-29" class="title">Getting Git on Linux</h2>
    <p class="normal">This book does not <a id="_idIndexMarker034"/>formally <a id="_idIndexMarker035"/>support Linux, but almost all of Git is the same on all platforms.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux, you can generally do so through the package management tool that comes with your distribution. If you're on Fedora (or any closely related RPM-based distribution, such as RHEL or CentOS), you can use <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">dnf</code>:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">$ sudo dnf install git-all
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">If you're on a <a id="_idIndexMarker036"/>Debian-based <a id="_idIndexMarker037"/>distribution, such as Ubuntu, try <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">apt</code>:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">$ sudo apt install git-all
</code></pre>
    <h2 id="_idParaDest-30" class="title">Checking your version</h2>
    <p class="normal">Once you <a id="_idIndexMarker038"/>have Git installed, your first command should be the following:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git --version
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">That is, the keyword <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">git</code>, and then <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">version</code>, preceded by two dashes. This is sometimes called "git dash dash version."</p>
    <p class="normal">The output on my computer is as follows:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">˃ Git --version
git version 2.30.0.windows.2
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">(Your mileage may vary.)</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-31" class="title">Configuring Git – the command line</h1>
    <p class="normal">We'll look at <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>configuring Git to personalize throughout this book, but for now, let's add your name and email address so that every entry into Git is stamped appropriately. Enter the command-line command:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git config --global --edit
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">This will bring up your editor. Find or create the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">[user]</code> section and add the following:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">[user]
name = Jesse Liberty
email = jesseliberty@gmail.com
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">You will probably want to use your own name and email address.</p>
    <p class="normal">There are other entries in the config file. Ignore them for now and save and close the file.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-32" class="title">Configuring Git – Visual Studio</h1>
    <p class="normal">In Visual Studio for <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>Windows, click on the Git menu and a dialog box will open. On the first tab, enter your username and email address:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/Image73605.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.8: Setting Git options in Visual Studio</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-33" class="title">Configuring Git – GitHub Desktop</h1>
    <p class="normal">To configure <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>GitHub Desktop, you'll need an account on GitHub. We'll cover that in the next chapter. Once you do have an account, go to <strong class="screenText">File | Options</strong>, select the <strong class="screenText">Accounts</strong> tab, and then click on <strong class="screenText">Sign in</strong>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/Image73613.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 1.9: Setting up GitHub Desktop</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-34" class="title">Summary</h1>
    <p class="normal">In this chapter you saw an introduction to the book, listing what is in each chapter. You also saw a quick history of version control and of Git itself.</p>
    <p class="normal">Next, we took a look at downloading the environments you'll need to follow along: Visual Studio 2019, GitHub Desktop, and PowerShell as your command line. All of these can be obtained for free.</p>
    <p class="normal">Once the software was downloaded, we looked at how to set up Git, and how to set up the tools we'll be using.</p>
