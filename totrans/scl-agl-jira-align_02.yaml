- en: Jira Align is a product whose time has come. Its story begins with agile frameworks
    created in the 1990s for development teams to deliver quality products early and
    often. When leaders of these frameworks met in Snowbird, Utah, to formulate the
    Agile Manifesto in 2001, team-level execution was still the focus. But the world
    has grown more complex in the two decades since, with the need for diverse sectors
    such as banking, automotive, and government to embrace digital transformation.
    As organizations struggle to create ever larger and more complex systems and even
    systems of systems (such as aerospace and military applications), the need to
    coordinate the delivery of numerous agile teams has grown more pressing.

    a talented engineer to answer this challenge by creating what would become AgileCraft
    and later Jira Align – a way to break down the barriers between product management,
    project management, and engineering to coordinate and deliver complex product
    development efforts. As the tool was taking shape, a new type of agile framework
    was emerging, one that harnessed the power of successful agile team delivery and
    scaled it both upward to teams within teams and ultimately the enterprise, and
    outward to parts of the organization not traditionally associated with agile.

    (**SAFe**), the leading framework for agile at scale, since SAFe was launched
    in 2011\. After 7 years of rigorous, real-life testing during his tenure as a
    technology executive, Steve left his day job and launched AgileCraft in 2013 to
    help companies achieve *enterprise agility at start-up speed*. By 2015, AgileCraft
    was named a Scaled Agile Gold Partner and Gartner Cool Vendor.

    for **Enterprise Agile Planning** (**EAP**) Tools. In 2019, Gartner named it a
    *leader* and Atlassian acquired AgileCraft. Today, known as Jira Align, it is
    still a leader, if not *the* leader. Moreover, the product is continuously improving,

    from the ground up as an agile-first platform, unlike competitors that attempt
    to transform waterfall **project portfolio management** (**PPM**) solutions into
    EAP tools. Much as SAFe builds upon team-level agile delivery and scales it to
    the program, solution, portfolio, and enterprise levels, Jira Align too works
    in concert with the top team-level agile tool, Jira Software, extending it to
    all levels of scale. It natively supports a variety of frameworks and approaches
    beyond SAFe, including **Disciplined Agile Delivery** (**DAD**), **Large-Scale
    Scrum** (**LeSS**), **Scrum@Scale**, Spotify, **Lean Startup**, custom frameworks,
    and any combination of these. It is therefore geared toward larger organizations
    that have or seek a more formal approach to agile at scale.

    hundreds to thousands of users across all levels of an organization. The quantity
    of developers using Jira Software is often a good indication of whether an organization''s
    size is well suited for Jira Align. If you have 500 or more developers using Jira

    Jira Software alone or in combination with Atlassian Marketplace apps may suffice.'

    apply when selecting a tool to support agile at scale. The first is that you cannot
    scale the unscalable. The second is that any tool is only as good as the underlying
    data, organizational structures, and agile practices that it visualizes and supports.
    Therefore, having a formal practice around agile at scale is often a leading indicator
    of successful outcomes with Jira Align. See the *Selecting a framework* section
    later for more information.'

    and execution focused on the highest-ranking features in the product backlog have
    become standard practice among companies engaged in agile delivery. The Program
    Board is one of the key pieces of functionality in Jira Align used to support
    this practice. But it''s best to have practical experience of a methodology before
    applying a tool to it, especially one that is so feature-rich it could be overwhelming
    at first. Therefore, it''s sensible to have at least two quarterly planning increments
    under your belt before introducing Jira Align.'

    agile delivery at the team level is a prerequisite to scaling with frameworks
    and tools. Just as you would not scale buggy code, you would not want to scale
    suboptimal product delivery methods. A good way to gauge the effectiveness of
    your teams is to review the 12 principles behind the Agile Manifesto. If your
    teams are regularly enacting at least 7 or 8 out of 12, such as satisfying the
    customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable product features (Principle
    1), then they''ve achieved a high degree of agility. Your organization can then
    build upon this foundation by scaling it to achieve goals such as the following:'

    embracing the agile mindset, first by learning it themselves, then by *walking

    others. Start small with a few showcase programs, generate short-term wins, then
    consolidate gains and produce more wins. John Kotter, author of *Leading Change*,
    has shown that this is the way to anchor new approaches in the culture. When teams

    scaling agile. This makes sense, as it reduces dependency on outside consulting
    firms and creates a sustainable agile capability. Even apart from agile, professional
    coaching is taking hold within many Fortune 1,000 companies. A recent study by
    the **International Coach Federation** (**ICF**) found that the typical company
    can expect a return of 7 times its initial coaching investment. It's important
    to note, however, that there's a wide range of expertise among those who practice

    toward a common understanding of how people, practices, and tools are orchestrated
    for efficient and effective delivery. In the best cases, your practices and tools
    work in unison to create competencies that allow your organization to scale and

    Therefore, resist the urge to modify the framework from the start. That would
    be analogous to an apprentice attempting to create their own form, skipping the
    Shu stage, and the results would not likely be optimal. Similarly, resist the
    tendency to think your organization is unique. Look for a case study analogous
    to your industry to see the results your peers are achieving and stick with the

    According to the 14th Annual State of Agile Report, Scrum is the leading agile
    methodology practiced by a majority of teams around the world, followed by hybrid
    approaches, Scrumban, and Kanban. Scrum is a lightweight agile framework practiced
