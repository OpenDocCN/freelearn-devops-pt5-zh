<p class="mce-root">Git is increasingly becoming the <em>de facto</em> standard for <strong>Source Control Management</strong> (<strong>SCM</strong>) in modern software development. </p>
<div><div><div><p>Originally developed by Linus Torvalds as an SCM system for the Linux kernel to replace the proprietary SCM BitKeeper, Git has since conquered most of the open source world and is also used by lots of organizations for their private/proprietary projects.</p>
<div><div><div><p>This book is designed to give you practical recipes for everyday Git usage. The recipes can be used directly or as inspiration. The book will cover the Git data model through practical recipes and in-depth explanations so you get a deeper understanding of the internal workings of Git. This book will show you the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>Working with the history. With Git, all the history is stored locally. You can search through the history, view the history, find the last commit on a certain branch, and more.</li>
<li>Using branches effectively with options and strategies to push, pull, and merge them.</li>
<li>Storing and extracting additional metadata in the Git repository.</li>
<li>Disaster recovery: local and global.</li>
</ul>
<div><div><div><p><em>Git Version Control Cookbook</em> gives you precise, step-by-step instructions for various common and uncommon Git operations. The book will make your daily work with Git easier by providing recipes for common issues, useful tips and tricks, and in-depth clarifications of why and how they work.</p>

<div><div><div><p>This book targets developers, professional build/release managers, and DevOps practitioners who want a practical guide for the next level of Git. Starting with the Git data model and advancing through branching to metadata and hooks, all through an easy-to-read recipe structure, the transition from simple, everyday use cases to advanced repository handling is smooth. The book can be easily read and understood by readers from the target audience. You need basic knowledge of common GNU/Linux tools and Shell/Bash scripting to get the most from this book.</p>
