		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-63"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor062"/>Chapter 4</em>: Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes</h1>
			<p>You should have created your first project by now, and maybe even a few new issues for your work. You also have a good idea of how to find your way around the project settings world to do some simple administration, if nothing more than looking at what is initially set up.</p>
			<p>Now it is time to dig deeper into how to make changes to the original objects created with the project template. Very few times will you just accept what gets created out of the box. Most likely, there will be several changes you want to make so that your project reflects more closely how you work in your organization or on your team. </p>
			<p>For example, modifying transitions in the workflow can be done to simplify the options available to users, so they only see relevant statuses when moving from column to column. Or maybe you want to only allow a change in statuses when a field is not empty (meaning the field becomes required at some point in the workflow). </p>
			<p>Whatever your need or motivation, this chapter will provide you with the necessary skills to make those modifications. As you make those changes and learn additional administration, you will see your productivity rise quickly. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Using the board</li>
				<li>Accessing and modifying the workflow</li>
				<li>The schemes used by <strong class="bold">Jira Work Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">JWM</strong>) projects</li>
				<li>Working with <strong class="bold">Atlassian Marketplace</strong> apps</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will be able to identify the nuts and bolts of a JWM project board. You will understand how to add more columns to the board and how to arrange the order of those columns. This will be done in conjunction with modifying the workflow for the type of work you are accomplishing. </p>
			<p>You will also be able to locate the schemes used to administer the JWM project and make simple changes to it. Finally, you will be able to explore and add some of the most used and powerful third-party apps available in the Atlassian Marketplace. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-64"><a id="_idTextAnchor063"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As JWM is only available in the <strong class="bold">Jira Cloud</strong> environment, the requirement for this chapter is simple:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Access to a Jira Cloud environment</li>
				<li>Access to an internet browser with the ability to navigate to the Atlassian Marketplace </li>
			</ul>
			<p>If you already have access to Jira Cloud, that's great – you're ready to go! If not, Atlassian provides a free JWM account for up to 10 users. You can create your account by going to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free">https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free</a> and following the instructions. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-65"><a id="_idTextAnchor064"/>Using the board</h1>
			<p>When managing software development or <a id="_idIndexMarker173"/>other technical projects, the <strong class="bold">Kanban board </strong>or <strong class="bold">Sprint board</strong> is the <a id="_idIndexMarker174"/>star of the show. Kanban simply wouldn't be Kanban without a board – either physical or digital/virtual. And Sprints are so much easier to manage when viewing the work on a board. </p>
			<p>Often, this is also the case with business projects. Visually seeing the work you need to do or have completed and viewing the progress you have made is debatably best using a board. Now that JWM projects have<a id="_idIndexMarker175"/> implemented <strong class="bold">inline editable lists</strong>, the board has less significance, although it will still be the major interaction point for most users. </p>
			<p>Lists will be covered in detail in <a href="B17952_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor082"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">JWM Toolset: Summary, List, Timeline, and the Calendar</em>, but for now, let's take a close look at the board. </p>
			<p>Inherently, business projects will not use<a id="_idIndexMarker176"/> the <strong class="bold">Scrum methodology</strong> and therefore will not have Sprint boards available. And although the board that is automatically created when a project is created is not technically a Kanban board, it has many of the same attributes. But for JWM projects, we will simply call it the <strong class="bold">board</strong>. </p>
			<p>As the development <a id="_idIndexMarker177"/>of the JWM product is still ongoing, you should expect to see some nice enhancements continue to be rolled out for the toolset, including the board. The images of the board shown in this book are the latest available at the time of publishing. </p>
			<p>It is important to point out some of the differences between the JWM board versus Jira software project boards; we<a id="_idIndexMarker178"/> will look at some of these differences in more detail later in this section: </p>
			<ul>
				<li>By design, only one board is created for JWM projects. You can create additional Kanban boards and use issues from your JWM project, but you will lose the built-in connection to the project. We will explore how to do this in this chapter. As mentioned earlier, no Scrum or Sprint functionality exists; if you need to perform this type of work, you should create a Jira Software project. </li>
				<li>You cannot change the inner workings of the board – including what colors or fields are displayed. </li>
				<li>Columns are directly related to statuses in your workflow. </li>
				<li>Only one workflow is allowed for every issue type for the board to function. </li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-66"><a id="_idTextAnchor065"/>Finding the board</h2>
			<p>To <a id="_idIndexMarker179"/>navigate to the board for any existing JWM project, we must begin by searching for the project:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Projects</strong> menu option in the top navigation bar and select your desired project if it is shown. </li>
				<li>By design, Jira will show the last five projects that you have visited. </li>
				<li>If you do not see the desired project, click on the <strong class="bold">View all projects</strong> link and search for the project. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows how to search for an existing project: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.1_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.1 – Searching for the project&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.1 – Searching for the project</p>
			<p>Whichever <a id="_idIndexMarker180"/>way you navigate to the project, the result will typically find you landing on the project board as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.2</em> in the next section. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-67"><a id="_idTextAnchor066"/>Components of the board</h2>
			<p>If you are<a id="_idIndexMarker181"/> familiar with the boards created for Jira Software projects, the most glaring difference for business project boards is the lack of the <strong class="bold">Board Settings</strong> functionality. This has been true from the start of the JWM product precursor, Jira Core, and remains that way for the time being. </p>
			<p>The result is that there is not a lot of functionality that you can change about the board. In this case, what you see is what you get, which makes things very simple. So, let's talk about the things that we do see, as shown in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.2_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.2 – The board&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.2 – The board</p>
			<p>We will begin at the top of the board and work our way down: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project name</strong>: While <a id="_idIndexMarker182"/>on any JWM project board, you will see the name of the project displayed at the very top in the breadcrumbs section. Jira's philosophy is that you arrive at a board by first navigating through a project. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Search and filters</strong>: Two <a id="_idIndexMarker183"/>search boxes can be seen while on the board screen. One exists all of the time in the top navigation bar, that box searches the entire Jira instance. The second is visible on the board and only searches for information on that board.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Columns</strong>: Columns<a id="_idIndexMarker184"/> represent statuses in the project's workflow. There is a one-to-one relationship between the column and each status. Another way to say that is that every status in the workflow will appear as a column on the board. Statuses cannot be hidden on the board. </li>
				<li><code>STAFF-4</code>)</li><li>The due date (if one exists for the issue) </li><li>The assignee (if one exists for the issue)</li><li>Resolution – this appears as a checkmark on the card if the card has a resolution</li><li>Sub-task count (if any exist for the issue)</li></ul></li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-68"><a id="_idTextAnchor067"/>Functions of the board</h2>
			<p>At<a id="_idIndexMarker186"/> face value, the <a id="_idIndexMarker187"/>board exists to show what work you are doing on the project and the status of that work. Outside of viewing the cards, there is very little functionality of a JWM project board. But let's look at what can be done.</p>
			<h3>Changing the status</h3>
			<p>One function<a id="_idIndexMarker188"/> is that you can quickly change the status of an issue by simply dragging the card from one column to another. Which column you can move the card to depends on which transitions exist in the project's workflow. We discuss that in detail in a later section in this chapter. </p>
			<h3>Searching the board</h3>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">search box</strong> near<a id="_idIndexMarker189"/> the top of the board provides a quick way to find issues on the board based on issue text or the issue key. This is especially helpful when there are several dozen cards visible on the board. Simply begin by typing information into the search box and the functionality will automatically hide any cards that do not match what was typed in the box. </p>
			<p>For example, typing <code>87</code> in the box will find any card on the board with a key that has the number 87, if one exists (<code>STAFF-87</code>, <code>ID-870</code>, and so on).</p>
			<p>To search your entire Jira instance for an issue, click in the search box in the top navigation bard.</p>
			<h3>Filtering issues</h3>
			<p>There <a id="_idIndexMarker190"/>are two <strong class="bold">QUICK FILTERS</strong> available on the board at this time – <strong class="bold">Assigned to me</strong> and <strong class="bold">Due this week</strong>. As you might guess, clicking on the <strong class="bold">Assigned to me</strong> filter shows only the cards on the board that are currently assigned to you. </p>
			<p>And clicking on <strong class="bold">Due this week</strong> will only show cards that have a value in the due date<strong class="bold"> </strong>field and the value is this week. It should be noted that if the due date is past due, you will see the date displayed in the color red. For cards that have not reached the due date, the dates will display in black. Note that the year is not included, just the day and month: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.3_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.3 – Board with recent dates&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.3 – Board with recent dates</p>
			<p>Now that we are more familiar with our way around the board, let's see how we can add some work to it. </p>
			<h3>Creating an issue</h3>
			<p>Finally, as we <a id="_idIndexMarker191"/>discussed in <a href="B17952_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor047"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Your First Project</em>, you can create new issues directly on the board. To do that, click on the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button at the bottom of the first column on the board, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.3</em>. This will pop up a new box with the words <strong class="bold">Start typing</strong> visible. </p>
			<p>Now that we have seen how to work with the standard board, let's explore how a second board can be created. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-69"><a id="_idTextAnchor068"/>Creating a second board</h2>
			<p>First, let me <a id="_idIndexMarker192"/>note that this is more of an advanced step and definitely outside-of-the-box thinking. Because of that, this new board will not be accessible directly from the project as the built-in board is. We will understand this better after we have created the board. </p>
			<p>So why would you want to create a second board? Mainly because the initial board created with your JWM project is not very customizable. With a second board, you can do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>You can choose to name the board whatever you like.</li>
				<li>You can choose the board filter being used, which will give you better control of the issues displayed on the board.</li>
				<li>You can add your own quick filters to the board.</li>
				<li>You can control colors for the side panel of the cards on the board.</li>
				<li>You can control which fields are displayed on the card when viewing the board. </li>
				<li>You have more control as to who can even see the board.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To begin, perform the following steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click the search box in the top navigation bar.</li>
				<li>Select <strong class="bold">Boards</strong> at the bottom of the display.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create board</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Select Scrum or Kanban. Unless you are using Sprints (which is very rare for business projects), click the <strong class="bold">Create a Kanban board</strong> button. </li>
				<li>Select the option for <strong class="bold">Board from an existing project</strong>. Then click <strong class="bold">Next</strong>. </li>
				<li>Give the board a name and select the project to which you would like to add this new board.</li>
				<li>For the <strong class="bold">Location</strong>, select <strong class="bold">Personal</strong> and then your username. </li>
				<li>Finally, click on the<strong class="bold"> Create board</strong> button. </li>
			</ol>
			<p>For steps 7 and 8, your<a id="_idIndexMarker193"/> view will look something like <em class="italic">Figure 4.4</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.4_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.4 – Board location&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.4 – Board location</p>
			<p>It's the <strong class="bold">Location</strong> field that gives most administrators trouble. Since this is a second board outside the purview of the main JWM project board, Jira does not allow you to use any JWM project for the <strong class="bold">Location</strong> field. That means that you cannot select the board from the left-hand menu while you are on the board. This makes it very hard for other users to find the board. I have found that the best method is simply to bookmark the URL for the board in your browser and share the address with others.</p>
			<p>Other users can also find the board by searching on the list of boards at <a href="https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/jira/boards">https://yourdomain.atlassian.net/jira/boards</a>, where <code>yourdomain</code> is the domain for your Jira instance. </p>
			<p>Yes, it's a bit of trouble to get the board set up and to share it with others, but many administrators and users find the increased functionality of the second board to be worth it. To learn <a id="_idIndexMarker194"/>more about board creation process, you can see the guidance from Atlassian Support at <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-a-board/">https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/create-a-board/</a>. And you can learn more <a id="_idIndexMarker195"/>about the board configuration process at <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/configure-a-company-managed-board/">https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/configure-a-company-managed-board/</a>.</p>
			<p>Next, we will see how to make changes to the project workflow.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-70"><a id="_idTextAnchor069"/>Accessing and modifying the workflow</h1>
			<p>We saw the importance of workflows in <a href="B17952_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Working with Project Templates</em>, and we explored how to access them in <a href="B17952_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor047"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Your First Project</em>. Now we will learn how to make changes to the workflow and how that affects the board.</p>
			<p>As a review, you <a id="_idIndexMarker196"/>must be a project administrator or a Jira administrator to be able to make changes to the workflow used by the project. If the workflow is shared across multiple projects, you must be a Jira administrator to alter the shared workflow.</p>
			<p>We will see how to share a workflow across multiple projects later in this section. For our initial purposes here, we will assume the workflow attached to the project is the original workflow created when we created the project and that it is not connected to any other project. Perform the following steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">To access<a id="_idIndexMarker197"/> the project workflow scheme, you must first begin by clicking on <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> in the lower options of the left menu: <div><img src="img/Figure_4.5_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.5 – Project settings&#13;&#10;"/></div><p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.5 – Project settings</p></li>
				<li>Again, if you do not see the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> menu option, then you do not have project administrator permissions. Once inside the <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> environment, click on the <strong class="bold">Workflows</strong> link on the left menu. This will display the workflow <a id="_idIndexMarker198"/>scheme attached to the project, as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.6</em>:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.6_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.6 – Project workflow scheme&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.6 – Project workflow scheme</p>
			<p>By default, JWM projects <a id="_idIndexMarker199"/>have only one workflow created for <a id="_idIndexMarker200"/>all issue types on the project. The workflow is present inside a workflow scheme, which is attached to the project. So, in our example in the preceding screenshot, <strong class="bold">STAFF: Project Management Workflow Scheme</strong> is the name of our workflow scheme. Note that <strong class="bold">STAFF: Project Management Workflow</strong> is indeed the name of our workflow and is associated with both the <strong class="bold">Task</strong> and <strong class="bold">Sub-task</strong> issue types. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-71"><a id="_idTextAnchor070"/>The workflow text view</h2>
			<p>We can view<a id="_idIndexMarker201"/> the workflow in text form by clicking on the <strong class="bold">View as text</strong> link beside the workflow name, as shown in the preceding screenshot. </p>
			<p>The text version is helpful primarily for seeing the relationships between statuses:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.7_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.7 – Workflow text view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.7 – Workflow text view</p>
			<p>These<a id="_idIndexMarker202"/> relationships are <a id="_idIndexMarker203"/>called <strong class="bold">transitions</strong> in the Jira world and identify the statuses that issues can move to and from. These transitions appear as lines in the <strong class="bold">diagram</strong> version, which we see displayed in <em class="italic">Figure 4.8</em>. </p>
			<p>To read the text version, the left side shows all of the statuses in the workflow. You can think of statuses as steps along the workflow path, and they appear as columns on the project board. The right-hand side shows the status that each of the left-hand statuses can move to. For instance, issues in the <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong> status can move to either the <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> status or the <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> status. </p>
			<p>The column in the middle shows the name of the transition that would be used to navigate to the desired next step or status. So, to move from the <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong> status to the <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> status, you would use the <strong class="bold">Start Progress</strong> transition. </p>
			<p>These transitions also make it known whether you can move from one status to another. If no transition exists between two statuses, it is not possible to move an issue between them. Our example in <em class="italic">Figure 4.7</em> is very straightforward in that all three statuses can move to both other statuses. This is not the case in all workflows. Some workflows follow a more linear path with steps that must be navigated in a rigid order.</p>
			<p>Transitions will also determine which columns on a board that a card can move to. If no transition exists between the statuses, you will not be able to migrate a card from that column to the other column. </p>
			<p>Finally, it is <a id="_idIndexMarker204"/>possible to add a screen that will pop up as you move from one status to another or one column to another. These screens are often referred to as transition screens. These screens typically have a small number of fields that often represent required data to move an issue between the steps. We will discuss these transition screens and how to add them later in this chapter. </p>
			<p>The text version of the workflow will identify the name of the transition screen that is available or used between statuses if one exists. Otherwise, it will simply say <strong class="bold">No Screen,</strong> as shown in our example in <em class="italic">Figure 4.7</em>. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-72"><a id="_idTextAnchor071"/>The workflow diagram view</h2>
			<p>If you click <a id="_idIndexMarker205"/>on the <strong class="bold">View as diagram</strong> link for the workflow, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.6</em>, you will see a more visual view of the workflow, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.8</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.8_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.8 – Workflow diagram view&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.8 – Workflow diagram view</p>
			<p>The diagram view is usually the easiest view to read and understand. The circle at the top represents the beginning of the workflow with the line from the circle to the first status (<strong class="bold">TO DO</strong> in this example) being known as the Create transition. The lines between the statuses, as mentioned earlier, represent the transitions between the statuses.</p>
			<p>The arrows at the ends of the lines show the direction in which an issue might move from one status to the other. So, a line with arrows at both ends means that issues can move back<a id="_idIndexMarker206"/> and forth between the two statuses. In reality, these are two different transitions with each going in a singular direction. They just happen to overlap in the diagram as produced by the project template. We can see an example of the dual transition lines in <em class="italic">Figure 4.11</em>. </p>
			<p>Look at the note in the bottom left of <em class="italic">Figure 4.8</em> that states <strong class="bold">Mouse over objects to see transition names</strong>. The objects it is referring to are the lines between the statuses in the diagram. To zoom in or out on the diagram, simply click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> or <strong class="bold">–</strong> buttons in the top left of the view. </p>
			<p>Clicking either of the links to <strong class="bold">View as text</strong> or <strong class="bold">View as diagram</strong> as described earlier will show the workflows in a read-only mode – you cannot change the workflow using either of these links. To make changes to the workflow, click the pencil icon under <strong class="bold">Actions</strong> on the right-hand side of the workflow scheme view, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.6</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-73"><a id="_idTextAnchor072"/>The workflow edit mode</h2>
			<p><strong class="bold">Edit mode</strong> will <a id="_idIndexMarker207"/>show the workflow in either the <strong class="bold">Diagram</strong> or <strong class="bold">Text</strong> interface. This will allow you to make changes to the workflow. Notice in <em class="italic">Figure 4.9</em> that we have entered <strong class="bold">Diagram</strong> edit mode. We also have clicked on the box to <strong class="bold">Show transition labels</strong>: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.9_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.9 – Workflow Diagram edit mode with transition names&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.9 – Workflow Diagram edit mode with transition names</p>
			<p>Notice how the<a id="_idIndexMarker208"/> transition names match the names as displayed in the <strong class="bold">View as text</strong> image, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 4.7</em>. Also, you will see the statement <strong class="bold">You are editing a draft workflow</strong> because we entered in edit mode. At this point, you can make changes and then save the modifications by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Publish Draft</strong> link near the top of the page, or you can dispose of the modifications by clicking the <strong class="bold">Discard Draft</strong> link. Or you can view the original as it was when you first created the workflow.</p>
			<p>Although there is a pencil icon next to the name of the workflow, you are not allowed to change the name here. Clicking the icon will open a dialog box that enables you to add a <em class="italic">description</em> for the workflow. Adding a description will display the entered text just below the workflow name. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-74"><a id="_idTextAnchor073"/>Editing the workflow</h2>
			<p>At this point, we<a id="_idIndexMarker209"/> can make changes to the workflow in a variety of ways. First, let's look at the transitions. As mentioned earlier, in our example, there are two transitions between every two statuses. That makes it much harder to edit individual transitions or to even clearly see that there is more than one. </p>
			<p>Clicking on one of the lines will reveal a pop-up box to the right of the diagram. Since the <strong class="bold">Stop Progress</strong> transition is on top of the <strong class="bold">Start Progress</strong> transition, when you click on the line, only the <strong class="bold">Stop Progress</strong> transition can be edited at this point. Notice that the <strong class="bold">Stop Progress</strong> transition name is displayed in the pop-up box and is shown inside a gray box on the line: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.10_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.10 – Editing workflow transitions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.10 – Editing workflow transitions</p>
			<p>When you select a transition, you will see a small black dot displayed at each end of the line. These dots will allow you to click on the end of the line and drag it to another circle on the same status or on another status. This will separate the two lines so that you can now edit the underlying <strong class="bold">Start Progress</strong> transition: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.11_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.11 – Moving workflow transitions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.11 – Moving workflow transitions</p>
			<p>When the <a id="_idIndexMarker210"/>dot is released, the <strong class="bold">Stop Progress</strong> name will shift to be on the new location of the transition line. <em class="italic">Figure 4.12</em> shows the result after all the transitions have been moved to provide more clarity: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.12_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.12 – Fully separated workflow transition lines&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.12 – Fully separated workflow transition lines</p>
			<p>To change the <a id="_idIndexMarker211"/>name of the transition, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the line for the transition you want to change.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> button in the pop-up box on the right-hand side.</li>
				<li>Change the name of the transition by changing the text in the <strong class="bold">Name</strong> field.</li>
				<li>This is also the point where you can add a transition screen to the transition. The screen must have already been created before linking it to the transition at this point. </li>
				<li>Simply click on the <strong class="bold">Screen</strong> drop-down box and select the screen: </li>

			<p>Triggers, conditions, validators, and post functions can add a lot of power to the workflow. Executing <a id="_idIndexMarker212"/>a transition will cause each of these items<a id="_idIndexMarker213"/> to fire in the order listed. Brief descriptions of what each function provides are listed here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Trigger</strong>: Causes <a id="_idIndexMarker214"/>events to happen in your connected development tools</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Condition</strong>: Controls<a id="_idIndexMarker215"/> whether the transition is visible to the user </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Validator</strong>: Checks<a id="_idIndexMarker216"/> that entered data is correct before allowing the transition to continue</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Post function</strong>: Performs<a id="_idIndexMarker217"/> additional processes such as setting values of fields, sending emails, auto-transitioning, and adding comments </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Atlassian's own document provides good guidance about each of these functions. You can see that guidance at <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-advanced-issue-workflows/">https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/configure-advanced-issue-workflows/</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-75"><a id="_idTextAnchor074"/>Adding statuses</h2>
			<p>For <a id="_idIndexMarker218"/>our Staff Meeting Project, let's say we want to add a new column to our project board. The intention is to bring more clarity about which presentations are still being prepared, which presentations have been finished and added to the agenda for the next staff meeting, and which presentations have been completely presented and are considered done. </p>
			<p>For the new column to be added to the board, we must first add a new status to the workflow: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">We enter <strong class="bold">Diagram</strong> edit mode for the workflow as described earlier.</li>
				<li>Then we click on the <strong class="bold">Add status</strong> button in the row just above the diagram.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>It should be noted that when we add a new status to the workflow, we can select from existing statutes already available in our Jira instance, or we can create and save an entirely new status for our organization to use. In the dialog box, we will enter <strong class="bold">On Agenda</strong> for the new status name: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.14_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.14 – Adding a workflow status&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.14 – Adding a workflow status</p>
			<p>Because the <strong class="bold">On Agenda</strong> status<a id="_idIndexMarker219"/> does not already exist for our organization, we see the words <strong class="bold">(new status)</strong> added next to our text. This is an informational note that we must create this new status for our Jira instance before it can be used. You must click on the <strong class="bold">On Agenda (new status)</strong> text for the system to recognize that you are indeed adding a new status to your instance. Then click the <strong class="bold">Add </strong>button.</p>
			<p>The ensuing pop-up box allows us to select one of the three status categories for our new status – <strong class="bold">To Do</strong>, <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. Since <strong class="bold">On Agenda</strong> represents work that is not completely done yet, we will choose <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong> for the <strong class="bold">Category</strong>: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.15_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.15 – Choosing a status category&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.15 – Choosing a status category</p>
			<p>We also<a id="_idIndexMarker220"/> can add a <strong class="bold">Description</strong> for the new status at this stage if we choose. Finally, we could select the box for <strong class="bold">Allow all statuses to transition to this status</strong> if the workflow should allow an issue to move to this status from any other status in the workflow. We will leave the box unchecked in this case since the <strong class="bold">On Agenda</strong> status path is more linear in nature. </p>
			<p>After the status is added to the diagram, we will need to connect the new status to the existing <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> status. We can do that by two different methods. One is by clicking on the <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> status and dragging a new line to the <strong class="bold">ON AGENDA</strong> status: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.16_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.16 – Adding a transition&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.16 – Adding a transition</p>
			<p>The result <a id="_idIndexMarker221"/>will be a dialog box that pops up to allow you to name the new transition. We will call this new transition <code>Move to On Agenda</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.17_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.17 – Naming a transition&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.17 – Naming a transition</p>
			<p>Be sure<a id="_idIndexMarker222"/> to click the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to save the transition and add it to the workflow. The second way to add a new transition is to click on the <strong class="bold">Add transition</strong> button as seen in <em class="italic">Figure 4.14</em>. </p>
			<p>For our second transition, we will add a transition from the new <strong class="bold">ON AGENDA</strong> status to the existing <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> status. However, in this case, we will reuse an existing transition that already goes to <strong class="bold">DONE</strong>. The primary reason to do this is that it potentially saves a large amount of time by not having to add any conditions, validators or post functions to a transition. It will make use of the functionality already in place when moving to the <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> status. Also, if you need to modify the transition, it only needs to be changed in a single location and have it applied to all the same transitions going to the <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> status. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">You must publish the draft workflow that contains your changes for the changes to be applied to your production instance.</p>
			<p>Finally, as we return <a id="_idIndexMarker223"/>to the project board, we see that the new <strong class="bold">ON AGENDA</strong> status has been automatically added as a column to the board: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.18_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.18 – Board view with new status&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.18 – Board view with new status</p>
			<p>Next, we will take a look at other schemes that are available for the administration of JWM projects.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-76"><a id="_idTextAnchor075"/>The schemes used by JWM projects</h1>
			<p>To use a <a id="_idIndexMarker224"/>metaphor, the project board and screens are like the body of a car – the shiny <a id="_idIndexMarker225"/>and sleek visual of what most of us actually identify as being the car. It's what we see and touch and show others. But under that JWM car is the chassis or frame, made up of schemes that set our permissions, control notifications and type of work, and provide the workflow, among other things.</p>
			<p>The best place <a id="_idIndexMarker226"/>to see the grouping of schemes is in the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> of <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong>. To navigate there, click on <strong class="bold">Project settings</strong> while on the project and then select <strong class="bold">Summary</strong>. Remember, you must be a project administrator to access and <a id="_idIndexMarker227"/>change project settings such as schemes:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_4.19_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 4.19 – Project settings summary&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 4.19 – Project settings summary</p>
			<p>Do not get too caught up in trying to read the fine print in <em class="italic">Figure 4.19</em>; we will discuss the major headings. We should also note that this is just a cursory introduction to the schemes. We will learn how to modify them in more detail in <a href="B17952_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor132"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring Permissions and Simple Administration</em>.</p>
			<p>Some of this information has been covered in previous chapters; however, it is good to see the schemes listed in an easy, summarized visual where scheme purposes can be compared. To get started, let's review the concept of schemes. </p>
			<p>We mentioned in <a href="B17952_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor047"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating Your First Project,</em> that schemes are like buckets that hold individual items related to the bucket. For instance, the <strong class="bold">screen scheme</strong> bucket will hold a set of screens used by the project. The <strong class="bold">workflow scheme</strong> will hold a set of workflows used by the project, and so on. </p>
			<p>Some schemes are at a project level and have no components underneath them. They apply to all issues on the project, regardless of the issue type. Other schemes are related to issue types and are more granular, and thus can contain one or several underlying components. Let's take a look at the list, beginning with the project-level schemes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue type scheme</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker228"/> scheme<a id="_idIndexMarker229"/> contains the list of issue types available for use in the project. All issues created on the project must be related to one of the issue types in the scheme. Since it is inherently a list of issue types, it operates at the project level and not the issue type level. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Permission scheme</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker230"/> scheme contains <a id="_idIndexMarker231"/>all permissions for the project, which control access to the project by users and what they are allowed to do when interacting with the project. It uses project roles, individual usernames, and/or groups to whom permissions may be granted. It operates at the project level.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Notification scheme</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker232"/>scheme identifies<a id="_idIndexMarker233"/> to whom and under what circumstances notifications are sent. Most of the notifications involve the creation of or changes to issues but will also address worklog or time tracking changes. It controls both emails and in-application notifications. It operates at the project level.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue security scheme</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker234"/> scheme <a id="_idIndexMarker235"/>controls who can see what issues are in the project. Multiple levels can be made available for the project, but only one level can be applied to each issue. Since there is no field-level security available in Jira, this is the most granular security level that can be applied. The scheme operates at the project level. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Workflow scheme</strong>: Workflows <a id="_idIndexMarker236"/>identify <a id="_idIndexMarker237"/>the path that an issue can take from its creation until its final resolution. There can be multiple workflows related to a scheme and each workflow must be related to one or more issue types. For JWM projects, only a single workflow is <a id="_idIndexMarker238"/>allowed within the scheme for the project board to function properly. The scheme operates at the issue type level.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Screen scheme</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker239"/> scheme provides a<a id="_idIndexMarker240"/> list of screens available for the project. There can be three different types of screens in the scheme – <strong class="bold">create, edit, and view</strong>. One screen type is considered the default. The screen scheme must be attached to an issue type screen scheme, which identifies screens at the issue type level. Therefore, the scheme operates at the issue type level. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue type screen scheme</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker241"/> scheme <a id="_idIndexMarker242"/>identifies which screen schemes are attached to a single or multiple issue type. Therefore, you can have a separate create screen for each issue type, a separate edit screen for each issue type, and so on. Of course, it does not have to be broken down to this level. You can have a single screen that performs all functions – <strong class="bold">create, edit, and view</strong> – for all issue types. This is the out-of-the-box configuration for JWM projects. The scheme operates at the issue type level.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Field configuration scheme</strong>: This<a id="_idIndexMarker243"/> scheme controls which fields are required when <a id="_idIndexMarker244"/>creating a new issue on a project. You can have separate field configuration files for each issue type, meaning each issue type can have different required fields when creating an issue. The field configuration file also controls the description for a field along with the type of rendering for text fields. This scheme operates at the issue type level. <p class="callout-heading">Note</p><p class="callout">All of the following schemes will automatically be created when you create a new JWM project. And each scheme can be modified by a project or Jira administrator, except for the permission scheme for free subscriptions. </p></li>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-77"><a id="_idTextAnchor076"/>Working with Atlassian Marketplace apps</h1>
			<p>Atlassian has<a id="_idIndexMarker245"/> long been known for the capability of its products. Whether it is the flagship products of the Jira family or some of the more recent acquisitions of other tools, Atlassian has gathered a quite impressive collection of productivity-enhancing applications. </p>
			<p>And as wonderful as this group of products has been and continues to be, Atlassian also extends the capabilities of Jira to even higher heights with the availability of products from third-party vendors through the Atlassian Marketplace. These are companies and applications that have been vetted by Atlassian and are available for additional purchase or maybe even for free! </p>
			<p>One of the nice accompaniments of the Marketplace is that Atlassian will handle the billing for and collection of payment for the use of tools provided by these vendors. So, you get a single bill, either monthly or annually, that includes your Atlassian products – such as JWM, and any third-party apps. </p>
			<p>Another amazing piece of trivia is that some of the products inside Atlassian started as Marketplace apps and were acquired by Atlassian over the years. Some of the more recent and most noticeable tools have<a id="_idIndexMarker246"/> been <strong class="bold">Automation for Jira</strong> and <strong class="bold">ProForma Forms</strong>. While<a id="_idIndexMarker247"/> the incorporation of Forms is still taking place, Automation has been a mainstay for many Jira users for the past couple of years. </p>
			<p>As a by-product of their acquisitions, many of the tools are offered either for free with Jira's Standard pricing subscription or with the Premium subscription. So, let's highlight a couple. Both tools provide some similar functionality and are highly rated apps as Atlassian Platinum Marketplace Partners that <a id="_idIndexMarker248"/>have earned Atlassian's <strong class="bold">Cloud Fortified</strong> rating for security, reliability, and support response time. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-78"><a id="_idTextAnchor077"/>Jira Miscellaneous Workflow Extensions by Innovalog Atlassian Apps</h2>
			<p>Known<a id="_idIndexMarker249"/> <a id="_idIndexMarker250"/>by the acronym of <strong class="bold">JMWE</strong>, the tool's company, Innovalog, was acquired by Atlassian solution provider <a id="_idIndexMarker251"/>powerhouse <strong class="bold">Appfire</strong> in 2020. JMWE extends Jira's out-of-the-box workflow function with powerful, yet easy-to-use, enhancements for conditions, validators, and post functions. </p>
			<p>Much of this functionality requires no coding so that the user can be productive immediately. Point and click your way to automated business processes in the blink of an eye. Or for even more capability, add some code through easy scripting functionality to build your conditions or validators for complex needs.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-79"><a id="_idTextAnchor078"/>ScriptRunner for Jira by Adaptavist</h2>
			<p>Long one of the <a id="_idIndexMarker253"/>favorites in the Atlassian Marketplace, <strong class="bold">ScriptRunner</strong> is also one of the most recommended tools by fellow Jira users. </p>
			<p>ScriptRunner makes<a id="_idIndexMarker254"/> use of Groovy scripts and advanced JQL to enhance and automate workflows while extending Jira usage.</p>
			<p>While having a coding background will be a tremendous help in navigating the tool, you will find it is unmatched in the power and control you receive. The unique set of available JQL functions allows you to create filters that ordinary searches would never be able to do. This includes bulk update functionality that allows you to save tons of time. </p>
			<p>Sign up for a free trial or learn more<a id="_idIndexMarker255"/> about ScriptRunner for Jira at <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/6820/scriptrunner-for-jira?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/6820/scriptrunner-for-jira?hosting=cloud&amp;tab=overview</a>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-80"><a id="_idTextAnchor079"/>Other apps</h2>
			<p>The Atlassian Marketplace offers hundreds of apps representing a plethora of functionality. There are <a id="_idIndexMarker256"/>apps for cloning, capturing time logs and reporting, calendars, email and notifications, checklists, and many, many more. You can see the full list for Cloud at <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?hosting=cloud">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/search?hosting=cloud</a>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-81"><a id="_idTextAnchor080"/>New terms learned in this chapter</h1>
			<p>Let's conclude the chapter by going through the list of new terms learned in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Trigger</strong>: Causes events to happen in your connected development tools.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Condition</strong>: Controls whether the transition is visible to the user. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Validator</strong>: Checks that entered data is correct before allowing the transition to continue.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Post function</strong>: Performs additional processes such as setting values of fields, sending emails, auto-transitioning, and adding comments. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inline editable lists</strong>: Lists of issues where many, if not all, of the fields in the issue can be edited in the list view without opening the full issue detail view.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quick filters</strong>: Simple filters that are easily accessible to the user directly on the list view or board. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Location</strong>: A system field associated with a company-managed project board designating which project the board will be visible under. JWM projects will use the user's profile instead. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Atlassian Marketplace</strong>: A website where free and paid third-party apps that help extend the functionality of Jira are available. </li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-82"><a id="_idTextAnchor081"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>As we have seen, there's no better way to get started with your new project than by adding issues to your project board and starting to manage your work. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we have learned how to modify the board and underlying workflow, providing us with enhanced flexibility to better adapt to how we do work in our organization. Now you don't have to settle for out-of-the-box functionality; you can modify it to meet your needs and extend your productivity.</p>
			<p>We are also now familiar with JWM schemes and understand how to adjust them to give us more control of our project. And to give us even more power, we learned how Atlassian Marketplace apps such as JMWE and ScriptRunner can be added to the already excellent Jira family of products to produce even bigger and better results. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will begin to explore the new components that have come with the JWM rebranding, such as the List, Calendar, and Timeline. These are some of the newest and most exciting tools in the Jira toolset.</p>
