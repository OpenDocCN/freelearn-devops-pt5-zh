<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we'll take a look at projects that help to keep our work organized. We'll learn in detail about JIRA and how it can be used in managing all our projects. Let's get started.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this chapter, we will learn about the following topics:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Introduction to JIRA</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">This section is on JIRA software essentials. In this section, we will learn about what JIRA is, and getting started with creating projects and how JIRA can organize the work that we include within it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">What is JIRA?</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">JIRA has been in place for a while, and it originally as an issue ticketing system, with a bug tracking kind of software, but, as project management has evolved over the years, Agile processes have become increasingly popular. JIRA has become a very effective Agile management tool for both Scrum and for common, and is now primarily used in that way.</p>
<p class="calibre2">JIRA has three different packages that it offers at this time:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="mce-root1">JIRA Core</li>
<li class="mce-root1">JIRA Software</li>
<li class="mce-root1">JIRA Service Desk</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">These packages include the base software of JIRA Core and also include Agile project management features.</p>
<p class="calibre2">JIRA has been used extensively and it has a huge community with lots of add-ons, which allow for planning, tracking, releasing, and reporting. Here's a link we can use to learn more about JIRA: <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira" class="calibre10">https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">How JIRA uses projects as a way to keep work organized</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">Here are the following steps to view projects in JIRA:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="mce-root1">Log in using the JIRA credentials. We will now notice that we've already created a First Project. It's a Software type project:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00005.jpeg" class="calibre16"/></div>
<p>Project view</p>
<ol start="2" class="calibre13">
<li value="2" class="mce-root1">To understand how this was done, click on Create project.</li>
<li value="3" class="mce-root1">Name this project <kbd class="calibre12">Second Project</kbd>. We can now see in the following screenshot that we have a Scrum template, and we could change that to something else if we wanted to, but for now, we'll leave it as it is and click on the Create button:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00006.jpeg" class="calibre17"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre13">
<li value="4" class="mce-root1">We have the <kbd class="calibre12">Second Project</kbd>, and, as we can see in the following screenshot, we've got our First Project in our Second Project:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00007.jpeg" class="calibre18"/></div>
<ol start="5" class="calibre13">
<li value="5" class="mce-root1">Go to View all projects, where we can see all of the projects:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00008.jpeg" class="calibre19"/></div>
<ol start="6" class="calibre13">
<li value="6" class="mce-root1">Click on Second Project. We can see in the following screenshot what this backlog view looks like. This is where we can create a test story and put items in our backlog:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00009.jpeg" class="calibre20"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">JIRA uses projects to help us organize our work and create a holding place for everything. It uses a key, which is a three or four digit ID, which we can reference as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We'll go more into detail about what all of these different things are in the UI, but for now, it's important to note that projects are what JIRA uses in order to organize our work. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating an account with Atlassian</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to learn how to create an account and how to set up our JIRA software so that we can begin using it for project management:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="mce-root1">Open the <em class="calibre21">Atlassian</em> website. We'll see that there's plenty of information about the company, about some of the different software products that they have, and more. We'll go to the Try free button at the top of the page:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00010.jpeg" class="calibre22"/></div>
<ol start="2" class="calibre13">
<li value="2" class="mce-root1">We'll see that they've got some options. We're going to use the Jira Software. They have a server version and a cloud version:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00011.jpeg" class="calibre23"/></div>
<ol start="3" class="calibre13">
<li value="3" class="mce-root1">We're going to be using the cloud version, so let's select that. We can see that we can try it for free for seven days, but we've also got some different options for once it becomes a paid subscription. Since we're just a small team, we're going to go ahead and take the first option, which is $10 a month, and we're going to Try it free:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00012.jpeg" class="calibre24"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre13">
<li value="4" class="mce-root1">We'll see that on the following screen, it's going to ask us to go ahead and set up our URL. We'll choose <kbd class="calibre12">digitalcoffeetest</kbd>, we'll put in our name, our email, and we can see that we then have to add a password:</li>
</ol>
<p class="cdpaligncenter2"><img src="img/00013.jpeg" class="calibre25"/></p>
<p class="cdpalignleft1">Once we do that, the website will go ahead and send us an email to validate the data that we have just given them. Once we check our email and validate that the information is correct, we will then go back to the site and log in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Creating an account is that easy. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Project creation and management</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going talk about creating projects and then managing those projects in JIRA.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The steps to create and manage projects in JIRA are as follows:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="mce-root1"> Select projects in the left-hand menu. We can see that we have a First Project and then a Second Project:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00014.jpeg" class="calibre26"/></div>
<ol start="2" class="calibre13">
<li value="2" class="mce-root1">Select the First Project. This will bring us to our Backlog view of the project. The backlog will store all of the stories, bugs, and different issue types that we want inside this project:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00015.jpeg" class="calibre27"/></div>
<p>Backlog view of the project</p>
<p class="calibre28">On the left, we'll see that we have the following different options. First, we have a search option. In our search, we can either type or we can also hit the slash key (<em class="calibre8">/</em>) on our keyboard. We've got some options regarding filtering and looking at assignees:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="front-matter">
<ul class="calibre29">
<li class="mce-root1"><strong class="calibre1">Sprints</strong>: We can select this and get the board view for the current Sprint</li>
<li class="mce-root1"><strong class="calibre1">Versions</strong>: This determines who gets report releases when we do a release of a version, in which case we can take a look at those issues, which will allow us to perform queries for different issues</li>
<li class="mce-root1"><strong class="calibre1">Components</strong>: These are a grouping of work items</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3" class="calibre13">
<li value="3" class="mce-root1">Go down to Settings. This will take us to the following screen:</li>
</ol>
<p class="cdpaligncenter2"><img src="img/00016.jpeg" class="calibre30"/></p>
<p class="cdpalignleft1">As we can see, we've got our name, we've got a key, URL, the type of project that this is, and we're going to stick with the software that's going to let us perform Agile processes like Scrum. We can categorize, we can select an image and description, we can also decide who is the admin on this project, and we can decide, when we create a new item in the backlog, whether it gets assigned to the project lead, which, in this case, would be the admin or we can even leave it as unassigned. </p>
<p class="cdpalignleft1">There are a lot of options on the left, but we're going to take a look at the summary, because the summary is going to give us a view of all of those different options, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00017.jpeg" class="calibre31"/></div>
<p>Summary</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Workflows</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">First, let's take a look at workflows so that we can understand how workflows operate. We'll go into more detail in the next section about workflows, but what we really need to understand is that this will control the way that the issues move from To Do, to In Progress, to Done, and this allows us to customize the way that it works:</p>
<div><img src="img/00018.jpeg" class="calibre32"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">If we take a look at screenshots for this project, we can see that we're using a Scrum issue type, so this will allow us to select the items that appear on those different issue types, which are things such as story points, assignee, and acceptance criteria:</p>
<div><img src="img/00019.jpeg" class="calibre33"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We will now look into the Fields. This allows us to control the fields that are available:</p>
<div><img src="img/00020.jpeg" class="calibre34"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can do things like setting up and creating components.</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="mce-root1">We will now click on Components on the left and we will call this component <kbd class="calibre12">Test</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00021.jpeg" class="calibre35"/></div>
<ol start="2" class="calibre13">
<li value="2" class="mce-root1">This will now allow us to assign this component to different issue types. We can do things such as set permissions, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00022.jpeg" class="calibre36"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">And we can even set notifications as follows:</p>
<div><img src="img/00023.jpeg" class="calibre37"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">We can see that when an issue is created, we're going to notify all watchers, the current assignee, and the reporter when the issues are updated, and more besides. We can also customize this. If you're one of those people who receives way too many emails already, you might want to slim this down a little bit so that we're really only being notified about the most important actions. We know now how to create and manage our projects in JIRA.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">How to set up a project using scheme, screens, workflows, and permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">In the last section, we learned about the configuration scheme of JIRA, and how to set up projects with regard to screens, workflows, permissions, and even notifications.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this section, we're going to learn about the following in detail:</p>
<ul class="calibre11">
<li class="mce-root1">Screens</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Workflows</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Permissions</li>
<li class="mce-root1">Notifications</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Screens</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">We are going to flip over to the JIRA account and look at our project view:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="mce-root1">First, we will select a project, and once we have our project loaded up, we're going to go ahead and choose our settings for this project. We'll go over to the left-hand menu and select Settings. As we learned previously, we will set up our settings.</li>
<li value="2" class="mce-root1">We saw a little bit about this in the previous section, but we're going to learn more deeply about Screens. We can see that we use what's called a Scrum issue type screen scheme. We've got a default screen scheme that will cover the different issue type Story, Epic, Task, and Sub-task, and then we've got a bug screen scheme that will cover the issue type Bug, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00024.jpeg" class="calibre38"/></div>
<ol start="3" class="calibre13">
<li value="3" class="mce-root1">Click the edit icon on the right. We can then take a look at the default issue screen, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00025.jpeg" class="calibre39"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre13">
<li value="4" class="mce-root1">This will give us control over all of the different fields that appear in an issue type. There may be some that we don't need to use, because our organization doesn't use them or we don't find value in those, in which case removing them from the interface will make things faster, so we don't need to have a view of those. The way we would do that is by dragging and moving these into different orders, but let's say for instance that we didn't want components. Therefore, we can easily just remove those by clicking on Remove. The components will no longer appear on any of our issue types with the exception of bug, right? We haven't configured the bug one yet.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5" class="calibre13">
<li value="5" class="mce-root1">At the bottom, we can see the ability to select the field, so we can actually select a field if we want to add something back, like <kbd class="calibre12">Components</kbd>:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00026.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Or, we could even just type <kbd class="calibre12">components</kbd> and add it back that way, and we'll drag it back up to the right before the description where we had it before. That's how we use screens in JIRA. Next, let's take a look at workflows.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Workflows</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">From the options on the left-hand side, click on Workflows. </p>
<p class="calibre2">What the workflow is going to let us do is allow us to see the different ways that a status can affect another status, and how items can move from one status to the next so that we can see how this works:</p>
<ol class="calibre13">
<li value="1" class="mce-root1">Click on FP: Software Simplified Workflow Scheme, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00027.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre28">This will take us to the following screen:</p>
<div><img src="img/00028.jpeg" class="calibre41"/></div>
<ol start="2" class="calibre13">
<li value="2" class="mce-root1">Any thing, and any type, can be move to TO DO. Once we create any type, we can automatically move it TO DO, any type can moved to DONE, and any type can move to IN PROGRESS.</li>
<li value="3" class="mce-root1">We can actually add a status as <kbd class="calibre12">Closed</kbd> by clicking on Add status.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4" class="calibre13">
<li value="4" class="mce-root1">Drag the Closed status to the bottom, below IN PROGRESS, and now we have a new status:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/00029.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">Then, we can allow different transitions to happen to this closed status. One example that we might want to do would be, let's say, if we have story points assigned to an item, or perhaps hours assigned to an item. When we move that through the workflow, and that item goes from IN PROGRESS to DONE, when we move it to CLOSED, we may want to have the remaining hours update itself to zero. This is an example of something that we might want to do with that workflow. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2"> We want to take a look at permissions, so we'll bring up the Permissions options for our default software scheme, which is what we're using for our Scrum project, as can be seen in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/00030.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p>Project Permissions</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since we're the only one that's actually accessing and controlling this, we have access to everything, but if we had more people that were assigned to this project, then we would be able to identify who can do what, both from a project permissions perspective as well as from an issue permissions perspective. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Notifications</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">We can see that we have a Notifications option under our First Project. We learned a little bit about this in the last section, but we will learn more about it now:</p>
<div><img src="img/00031.jpeg" class="calibre42"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">But let's say we were the person who reported an issue, and, when that issue was created, we would want the current assignee, the person that's assigned to that issue, to be notified, and we'd also want any of the watchers of that item to be notified as well. We, as the reporter, would be notified. But then let's say that that issue goes ahead and gets updated. Once that issue gets updated, it may be that we don't want to be notified of that. Therefore, we can edit the notifications.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Click on Delete under the Issue Updated section. This will take us to the following screen:</p>
<div><img src="img/00032.jpeg" class="calibre40"/></div>
<p class="calibre2">The reporter will now be notified when an item is created but not when it's updated. The reporter is again notified when the item is assigned.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre2">We've reached the end of our first chapter. In this chapter, we talked about what JIRA is, what it's used for today, why we should use it, and we talked about projects and how JIRA organizes its work into a project format. We learned how to create an account with Atlassian so that we can start using JIRA. We talked about creating and managing different projects in JIRA, and how to handle them. Lastly, we learned more about the specifics in the configuration of projects, such as screens, workflows, permissions, and notifications.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the next chapter, we're going to talk about managing all of those work items in more detail so that we've got lots and lots to do, and JIRA will help us to achieve that.</p>
