		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Preface</h1>
			<p>Over the years, Jira has grown from a simple bug-tracking system designed for engineers to manage their projects to an all-purpose issue-tracking solution. The term Jira now refers to a suite of products, including Jira Software, Jira Service Management, Jira Core, and others. With this change, each product is more focused on what it does and the value it provides. It is now easier than ever for customers to choose the product best suited to their needs, whether they are running an Agile software development project, a customer support portal, or simply a generic task management system.</p>
			<p>With the latest Data Center offering, Jira is now the go-to solution for any enterprise that is looking to future-proof its teams with performance, reliability, scalability, and security.</p>
			<p>In this book, we will cover all the basics of Jira and its core capabilities, as well as advanced features offered by the data center offering. We will also explore third-party apps that add additional features to the Jira platform. Packed with real-life examples and step-by-step instructions, this book will help you become a Jira expert.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book will be especially useful for project managers but it’s also intended for other Jira users, including developers, and in any other industry besides software development, who would like to leverage Jira’s powerful task management and workflow features to better manage their business processes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B18644_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor014"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic"> Getting Started with Jira Data Center</em>, serves as an overall introduction to Jira by going over its high-level architecture. We will cover both new deployments and how to upgrade from an existing deployment. We will also introduce the Jira Data Center offering from Atlassian. This will also serve as the starting point of the project that readers will go through.</p>
			<p><a href="B18644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Jira for Business Projects</em>, covers using Jira for projects that are not based on software development, for example, a generic task management solution.

			<p><a href="B18644_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Workflow and Business Process</em>, explores the most powerful feature offered by Jira, workflows.

			<p><a href="B18644_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor220"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Emails and Notifications</em>, talks about emails and how Jira can use them to send notifications to end users.
