                    <h1 class="header-title">Jira Service Desk</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In previous chapters, we focused on the Jira platform from Atlassian, which is primarily used for issue-tracking purposes. We covered topics such as customizing projects through screens and fields and integrating Jira with other third-party services.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will look at another closely related Jira product, called Jira Service Desk. This allows you to run a powerful support system, either alongside your engineering projects or independently as an all-purpose support solution. We will look at ways you can customize Jira Service Desk to provide a unique experience for your end users. Since Jira Service Desk is built on top of Jira, its installation procedure is almost identical to that of Jira, and you can refer to the recipes in <a href="db6108d0-082e-4a6f-835d-96ed24fcf2cf.xhtml">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Jira Server Administration</em>, for more details.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customizing the look and feel of your support portal</li>
<li>Capturing the right information for service requests from your customers</li>
<li>Setting up a knowledge base for your customers</li>
<li>Collaborating with your internal teams on service requests</li>
<li>Tracking and evaluating performance with a <strong>Service Level Agreement</strong> (<strong>SLA</strong>)</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Customizing the look and feel of your support portal</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira Service Desk has two main interfaces—one for the customers raising requests and one for the agents providing solutions. In this recipe, we will look at how to customize the service desk portal, which is the frontend user interface used by your customers.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To fully customize your service desk portal, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to Jira Service Desk as an administrator.</li>
<li>Browse to <strong>Administration</strong> &gt; <strong>Applications</strong> &gt; <strong>Configuration</strong> (under Jira Service Desk).</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>View and customize</strong> link under Help Center.</li>
</ol>
<p>From here, you can configure a range of customizations for how the service desk portal will look when a customer visits it. You can add a logo, banner, color scheme, and announcement messages. With announcement messages, you can use wiki markup, so you will be able to use styles such as bold and italics and create hyperlinks. For example, the following announcement message uses some of this markup:</p>
<pre><strong>Welcome to the newly launched Global Support Center! </strong><br/><br/><strong>If you have any issues or questions, please contact us at help@support.company.com. We are here to help!</strong><br/><br/><strong>_your friendly support team_</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mceNonEditable"/>
<p>Your customizations will be reflected as soon as you make the change. Once you are happy with the result, click on the <strong>Save changes</strong> button at the bottom of the screen:</p>
<div><img src="img/39fd6e02-52ce-458d-b5d7-811bb49f0491.png"/></div>
<p>After you have customized the look and feel of your service desk portal, you will need to customize the type of requests that customers can make. By planning out the request types properly, you can help your customers to better understand where to log their requests so that they can be routed to the relevant team members for faster resolution. Request types are managed for each service desk (Jira project):</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse to the service desk that you want to set up request types for.</li>
<li>Click on the Project settings<strong> </strong>option in the lower-left corner of the screen.</li>
<li>Select the Request types<strong> </strong>option from the panel on the left-hand side panel.</li>
<li>Add a new request type by entering the name of the request, its type, and the groups it belongs to. Requests in the same group will be displayed together in the portal. Note that a request can belong to multiple groups.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>When selecting and creating groups for your requests, try to name them based on the common theme shared by all the request types that belong to it:</p>
<div><img src="img/e535f0ff-9a45-430c-97bd-75f73279d931.png"/></div>
<p>We will now take a look at how this works.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira Service Desk leverages many of Jira's built-in capabilities, and its request types are built on top of the issue type feature. A request type in a service desk is mapped to an issue type in Jira. The main difference here is that the request type is what the customer sees, so it allows you to give it a more descriptive name to help customers better understand the purpose behind each request type. For example, an issue type called <strong>bug</strong> can have a request type called <strong>report</strong> and an application defect mapped to it. While they will both mean the same thing to a support agent or engineer, the request type will be a lot friendlier in the eyes of a customer.</p>
<p>For this reason, when managing request types, you need to make sure the corresponding issue types exist for the service desk project before you can map to it. You can refer to the <em>Setting up different issue types for projects</em> recipe in <a href="ac94afe9-5c3e-461c-abcf-9e4eb2bef9fd.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Customizing Jira for Your Projects,</em> for detailed information:</p>

<p>With this, we have completed our recipe.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Capturing the right information for service requests from your customers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this recipe, we will explore how to customize the screen and field layout for different request types so that you can capture the necessary information from your customers and help your agents to resolve issues quickly. We will also look at setting up different screens and fields for agents so that they can capture additional information independently from the customer's view.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To configure the field layout for the customer portal, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse to the service desk to customize the field layout.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Project settings </strong>option in the lower-left corner.</li>
<li>Select the <strong>Request type </strong>option from the panel on the left-hand side.</li>
<li>Click on the <strong>Edit fields </strong>link for the request type to configure.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Click on the <strong>Add a field </strong>button to add fields to the portal. If you do not see the field you want to add, make sure the field is added to the appropriate screen used by the project:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/c8a30813-381a-4420-868e-81b5ca3fdf8e.png"/></div>
<p>To customize the field layout for agents, you need to configure the screens used for the service desk project. You can refer to the <em>Setting up customized screens for your projects</em> recipe in <a href="ac94afe9-5c3e-461c-abcf-9e4eb2bef9fd.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Customizing Jira for Your Projects,</em> for detailed information. The most straightforward method is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the <strong>Screens </strong>option from the panel on the left-hand side.</li>
<li>Expand the screen scheme for the issue (request) type.</li>
<li>Click on the screen for the <strong>View Issue </strong>operation.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Search and add the fields that you want to the screen. Fields you add in this way will not be shown to customers unless you specifically add them to the request type, as outlined earlier:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/b44c5162-1a07-4f28-8dae-90b304e18874.png"/></div>
<p>If your service desk uses different screens for Edit and View, make sure you make the same changes to the Edit Issue screen so that your agents can make changes to those fields.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Jira Service Desk project's field layout is powered by Jira's screen configurations, which include screens, screen schemes, and issue type screen schemes. For the customer portal, Jira Service Desk provides a simplified version of the screen used by the Create Issue operation to keep the user experience smooth. This is why, for you to be able to add a field to a request type, the field must first be added to the Create Issue operation screen:</p>
<div><img src="img/dad297d4-6f2f-47f5-a0ca-c018ee918fe4.png" style="width:34.42em;height:41.08em;"/></div>
<p>For the agent's view, Jira Service Desk makes full use of Jira's screen and field management features, so you can set up different screens for the Edit and View Issue operations.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Setting up a knowledge base for your customers</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As time progresses, you should start accumulating a wealth of knowledge for common problems faced by customers. It is recommended that you capture this knowledge and make them searchable and indexable through search engines such as Google so that customers can find solutions to these common problems quickly.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will set up a knowledge base using <strong>Atlassian Confluence</strong> product. By integrating with Confluence, your service desk agents will be able to create articles to capture problem symptoms and solutions based on a set of predefined templates and make them searchable in the service desk.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first step is to create an application link between Jira and Confluence. You can refer to the <em>Integrating Jira with Confluence</em> recipe in <a href="e4cabab0-5854-4bb3-8ac5-f3837121acc8.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Integrations with Jira,</em> for detailed information. If you have already integrated Jira and Confluence, you can skip these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse to the service desk that you want to set up a knowledge base for.</li>
<li>Click on the Project settings<strong> </strong>option in the lower-left corner of the screen.</li>
<li>Select the Knowledge base<strong> </strong>option from the panel on the left-hand side.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Click on the Set up a link to Confluence<strong> </strong>link. If you do not see the following screenshot, then you have already integrated Jira with Confluence, and you can skip this section:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/99e80af6-3833-44a4-8075-aa1433677278.png"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>Enter the fully qualified URL for your Confluence instance, and click on the Create new link button.</li>
<li>Follow the onscreen wizard and complete the setup process.</li>
</ol>
<p>With the application link in place, we can now go back to the service desk. You should now see the options to link the service desk to a Confluence space.</p>
<p>You may have to refresh your page to see these options after the application link is created.</p>
<p>To set up a Confluence space as a knowledge base for your service desk, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Select the Link to a Confluence space<strong> </strong>option.</li>
<li>Select the linked Confluence application from the Application drop-down list.</li>
<li>Select the space that will become the knowledge base for your service desk. If no space is designated at this point, you can click on the Create a knowledge base space<strong> </strong>link to create a new space on the fly:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/b358059d-18a3-45a4-b053-c70de868383c.png" style="width:41.92em;height:26.67em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Click on the Link button after you have selected or created your knowledge base Confluence space.</li>
</ol>
<p>The last step is to configure the knowledge base access controls so that autosearching the portal will return results. If both Jira Service Desk and Confluence are connected to the same user repository, such as an LDAP, then they should have the same user accounts. Make sure you grant end users read access to the knowledge base space and give page access to your agents.</p>
<p>Once you have set up a knowledge base, there will be a new section called Related knowledge base articles for the agent's view. An agent can create a new knowledge base article by performing the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the create an article<strong> </strong>link:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/bcf6abfb-c2db-45e5-b793-bcec0208f760.png"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Enter the title for the new article, select a label, and then select the template to use for the article's content.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Click on the <strong>Create </strong>button. This will take you to the article in Confluence, which will be prepopulated, based on the selected template. You can edit the content and publish it when ready:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/1db8d265-30d5-4b4b-8b94-f7298ab3ce94.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">It's now time to see how these steps work.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>By integrating Jira and Confluence through an application link, we created a one-to-one mapping of a Jira service desk and Confluence space. Whenever an agent clicks on the create an article link from a request, they will create a new page in the mapped Confluence space, based on the selected template.</p>
<p>Confluence comes with two default templates to use for the knowledge base: <strong>how to</strong> and <strong>troubleshooting</strong>. You can add more templates to Confluence, and they will be available for your agents when they want to create new articles.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>By setting up a knowledge base for your service desk, search results will include knowledge base articles when your customers perform a search from your portal. This is shown in the following screenshot as well:</p>
<div><img src="img/10c41105-a240-4bc7-8842-d4f09e6fe378.png" style="width:29.08em;height:30.25em;"/></div>
<p>Jira Service Desk will also automatically suggest articles based on the customer's input when raising new requests, helping them to get solutions more quickly, and avoiding the duplication of requests and your team's efforts.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Collaborating with your internal teams on service requests</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The traditional workflow of a service desk involves a customer raising a request, and an agent working with the customer to come up with a solution. This usually works in scenarios where the problem is simple and straightforward to solve. However, in many real-world situations, the problem can be complicated and may require multiple people from different teams to collaborate together in order to resolve it.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will explore how to collaborate with people outside of the standard support team. Normally, you will run a single Jira instance host for both your service desk and engineering projects, so it is very easy to collaborate together in a single system. In this recipe, we will look at a more complex scenario, where the support team is using a Jira Service Desk instance, and the engineering team is using a separate Jira Software instance, and both teams are working together on resolving a customer's request.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first step is to create an application link between your Jira Service Desk instance and the Jira Software instance. You can refer to the <em>Integrating Jira with other Jira instances</em> recipe in <a href="e4cabab0-5854-4bb3-8ac5-f3837121acc8.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 7</a>, <em>Integrations with Jira</em>, for detailed information. If you have already integrated both Jira instances, you can skip these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Applications &gt; Application links.</li>
<li>Enter the Jira Software instance's URL, and create the application link. Jira should automatically detect the target application as Jira. If, for some reason, it does not do so, then make sure you select Jira as the Application type when prompted:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/f29617dd-747e-4d00-9aeb-574b3cb0779e.png" style="width:23.58em;height:9.58em;"/></p>
<p>Once you have linked both Jira instances, the agent and/or collaborator will be able to link the request in your service desk to the issue in the engineering project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse to the request in the service desk.</li>
<li>Select the Link option under the More menu.</li>
<li>Select the Jira Software instance from the Server drop-down list.</li>
<li>Choose the relationship between the request and issue. Usually, you should use the is caused by<strong> </strong>option.</li>
<li>Select the issue to link to the request. You can type in the issue key directly if you know it; otherwise, you can click on the search for an issue link to run a search.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Make sure the Create reciprocal link<strong> </strong>option is checked so that a link will also be created for the issue. This will let the engineers know that there is a customer request pending on the resolution of the issue, and will help the engineering team to prioritize their tasks.</li>
<li>Select the Internal comment<strong> </strong>tab if you want to add a comment to provide additional details to the agent working on the request. Comments added in this way will not be visible to the customer.</li>
<li>Click on the Link button to create the link.</li>
</ol>
<p>The screen looks like the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/ec207c5e-b38f-401a-a9de-81baaa2e9754.png"/></div>
<p>Now let's take a look at how these steps work.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Jira platform has an out-of-the-box feature called an application link, which allows you to integrate multiple instances of Atlassian products together—in this case, Jira Service Desk and Jira Software. By creating an application link between the two, our Jira Service Desk is able to recognize our Jira Software instance and access the data it has and, specifically, any issues.</p>
<p>Once we have created an issue link between the customer request and the engineering issue, both systems will be able to query and display each other's status. This means that when an agent looks at the request, they will also be able to see the status of the linked engineering issue, even if it is from a different system. Look at the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/3d9f89e3-23f7-4eaf-b725-9b99bd7dc4d2.png"/></div>
<p>Once the engineer completes the issue, the agent will see the status update automatically from within the request.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Tracking and evaluating performance with an SLA</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>An SLA helps you to measure the level of service performance of your team, and also provides insights into where improvements can be made.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will set up a new SLA metric for our service desk, where we will measure the amount of time it takes for the team to solve customer requests. However, we will not take into account the amount of time spent waiting for additional information from customers.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>To set up the SLAs, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Browse to the service desk that you want to set up SLAs for.</li>
<li>Click on the Project settings<strong> </strong>option in the lower-left corner of the screen.</li>
<li>Select the SLAs<strong> </strong>option from the panel on the left-hand side.</li>
<li>Click on the Create SLA<strong> </strong>option.</li>
<li>Enter a new name for the new SLA:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/91aa131e-9b32-41ff-a82e-334b9b1608b2.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Before you can create the new SLA metric by clicking on the Create button, you will first need to define how time will be measured:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Select the Issue Created<strong> </strong>option from the Start column.</li>
<li>Select the Status: Waiting for customer<strong> </strong>option from the Pause on column.</li>
<li>Select the Entered Status: Resolved<strong> </strong>option from the Stop column:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/ec4b7564-97f8-4b6d-a523-5bc1128ae2fe.png"/></div>
<p>After we have configured our time-counting rules, we need to set our SLA goals so that we can measure the team's performance:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Enter <kbd>priority = High</kbd> in the Issues (JQL) text field.</li>
<li>Set the Goal<strong> </strong>to <kbd>12h</kbd>, which is 12 hours.</li>
<li>Select Default 24/7 calendar if you want the SLA to be calculated to include non-working hours; otherwise, select Sample 9-5 Calendar if you only want to include working hours. Then, click on the Add<strong> </strong>button.</li>
</ol>
<p>You can repeat the three preceding steps to add more goals, and, once you are ready, click on the Create button to create the new SLA metric:</p>

<p>This completes the steps for this recipe. Let's take a look at how these steps actually work.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira Service Desk's SLAs are composed of two parts: how time is to be calculated and the goal to achieve under the given criteria. The goal setting part is quite straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A JQL query to define the rule</strong>: For example, <kbd>priority = High</kbd> means that all requests within the project with their priority set to High will have this SLA goal.</li>
<li><strong>The goal to achieve specified in time</strong>: For example, 8h means the goal for this SLA is 8 hours.</li>
<li><strong>The calendar to use</strong>: This defines the time and day when calculating whether the SLA goal has been met.</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The actual SLA calculation part is slightly more complex. When calculating SLA, we need to define the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When to start counting</strong>: This is defined in the Start column. In our recipe, we selected the Issue Created option, which means that the SLA will start counting as soon as a customer has created a request.</li>
<li><strong>When to stop counting</strong>: This is defined in the Stop column. In our recipe, we selected the Entered Status: Resolved option, which means that as soon as an agent puts the request into the Resolved workflow status, the SLA will stop counting.</li>
<li><strong>When to pause counting</strong>: This is optional, and is defined in the Pause on<strong> </strong>column. In our recipe, we selected the Status: Waiting for customer option; this means that once an agent has requested additional information from the customer, the SLA will be paused. Once the customer has provided the requested information, the SLA will resume counting again.</li>
</ul>
