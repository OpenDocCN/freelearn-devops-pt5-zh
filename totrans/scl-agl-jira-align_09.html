		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Chapter 7</em>: Enterprise and Portfolio Challenges</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we focus on the common problems and struggles faced at the highest levels of an organization: the enterprise and its portfolios. Depending on its size, an enterprise may have one or many portfolios. We'll learn how the enterprise sets the strategy and how portfolios play a crucial role in connecting strategy to execution. We'll then explain the<a id="_idIndexMarker339"/> benefits of the <strong class="bold">lean portfolio management</strong> (<strong class="bold">LPM</strong>) approach and how Jira Align supports it. Lastly, we will cover a number of ways in which to improve innovation.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Connecting strategy to execution</li>
				<li>Implementing LPM</li>
				<li>Promoting innovation</li>
			</ul>
			<p>By the end of the chapter, you will know how and why you'd access the strategy and portfolio rooms, create strategic snapshots, establish portfolio vision, create portfolio objectives and OKRs, use reports such as <em class="italic">Investment by Theme</em> and <em class="italic">Investment vs. Actuals</em>, leverage ideation functionality, and much more.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>Connecting strategy to execution</h1>
			<p>Jira Align is purpose-built to <a id="_idIndexMarker340"/>connect strategy with execution and provide visibility and alignment. Often, connecting strategy with execution is a top-down, bottom-up, meet-in-the-middle approach. We've covered the basics from a bottom-up perspective in <a href="B16328_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Jira Align</em>, beginning with connecting to Jira Software, where the tactical execution of team-level work items happens. Stories connect to features (Jira epics), then to capabilities, portfolio epics, and themes in Jira Align. Once these work item levels are connected, you can then harness the power of Jira Align's vast reporting capability. For example, you can view spend by theme with the help of the Investment vs. Actuals report or track budgets with financial status reports. We'll now examine the top-down perspective, beginning with the<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> strategy room.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Strategy room</h2>
			<p>The strategy room <a id="_idIndexMarker342"/>is the highest-level module in Jira <a id="_idIndexMarker343"/>Align. It is where you model your organization's mission, vision, and values, and specify the long-term goals toward which the various work item levels and their associated outcomes align. It enables executives to ensure that execution aligns with corporate strategy while simultaneously empowering team members with an understanding of the value of their work and how it contributes to the enterprise goals.</p>
			<p>To begin, go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Enterprise</strong> | <strong class="bold">Strategy Room</strong>. Next, choose a strategic snapshot from the dropdown to load associated work items and outcomes. Strategic snapshots are at the highest level of the time dimension in Jira Align. In practice, each snapshot comprises a set of program increments. In the following screenshot, we have selected the <strong class="bold">Corporate Strategy 2020</strong> strategic snapshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.1_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.1 – Jira Align strategy room"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.1 – Jira Align strategy room</p>
			<p>Here, you can view or edit the mission, vision, and values by clicking on them in the top-left corner. The <strong class="bold">Execution Against Outcomes</strong> section in the top-right area shows the percent complete for each level of work item contributing to outcomes. Click on an outcome level such as <strong class="bold">Yearly Goals</strong> to view and edit items. The <strong class="bold">Snapshot Progress</strong> section below it shows the percent complete for each level of work item, regardless of whether or not they link and contribute to outcomes. </p>
			<p>Next, let's view the <strong class="bold">Strategy Pyramid</strong> section to <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>visualize strategic alignment. You may need to scroll down to view<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> the whole pyramid, such as the one shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.2_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.2 – Jira Align strategy pyramid"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.2 – Jira Align strategy pyramid</p>
			<p>The pyramid shows the levels of your strategic hierarchy from the top down, as well as the count of each item type. For example, in the preceding diagram, there are four long-term strategy items. Note that the count <a id="_idIndexMarker346"/>of work items at the right of the lower levels represents <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>the count of items linked and contributing to the outcomes shown on the left. For example, there are 10 themes connected to 8 yearly goals, but there may be other unconnected themes. Click on a strategy, goal, or objective type in the pyramid to create and edit those items.</p>
			<p>Note that the pyramid is configurable, both in terms of the number of levels and the outcome names at each level. The Jira Align administrator can rename the outcome levels under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform Terminology</strong> and scroll down to <strong class="bold">Customize Pyramid Display</strong> to toggle levels on or off.</p>
			<p>By default, the pyramid has nine levels. However, in our experience, very few organizations require all nine levels of the strategic hierarchy. Therefore, we have toggled off two levels, <strong class="bold">North Stars</strong> and <strong class="bold">Long-Term Goals</strong>, in the Jira Align environment shown in our screenshots.</p>
			<p>The strategy room focuses on outcomes over outputs. For example, OKR health can be gauged by scrolling <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>down to see a heatmap located under the<a id="_idIndexMarker349"/> strategy pyramid, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.3_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.3 – Jira Align OKR heatmap"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.3 – Jira Align OKR heatmap</p>
			<p>The heatmap's color indicators and statistics provide a quick visual representation of how you're doing in terms of achieving the different levels of strategic goals and objectives shown on the right along with their item counts. Clicking on the goals will direct you to the strategic backlog for that level and clicking on the objectives will direct you to the objectives grid.</p>
			<p>The program increments associated with the strategic snapshot are shown along the top of the heatmap, and you can refine them further using the configuration bar. The heatmap's rows contain blocks with statistics for each outcome level during each PI in the snapshot. Since strategic goals aren't associated with PIs, they display as a single block that spans across all PI columns.</p>
			<p>Each block displays the average percentage of progress made on the key results at the strategic goal or objective level. For the objective blocks in the lowest three levels, progress is only calculated for key results of objectives that are associated with PIs.</p>
			<p>The blocks are color-coded according to the average key result score for objectives or strategic goals at that <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>level (to the nearest 0.1), which displays<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> at the bottom of the block, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Gray = not scored (N/A). This indicates that none of the key results at the objective or goal level have been scored. If at least one key result has been scored, then the unscored key results will receive a score of zero in the average calculations.</li>
				<li>Red = 0.3 and below.</li>
				<li>Yellow = 0.4 to 0.6.</li>
				<li>Green = 0.7 and above.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we've explored some of its key functionality, let's see how to create the strategic snapshots that drive the strategy room.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor121"/>Strategic snapshots</h2>
			<p>The strategic snapshot<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> provides the time dimension for the<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> strategy room, allowing you to plan and track the progress of corporate strategy by month, quarter, or year. To manage snapshots, click on the <strong class="bold">Strategic Snapshots</strong> button near the top-right corner of the strategy room or go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Enterprise</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Strategic Snapshots</strong>. This opens the strategic snapshots grid shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.4_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.4 – Jira Align strategic snapshots"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.4 – Jira Align strategic snapshots</p>
			<p>To create a<a id="_idIndexMarker354"/> strategic<a id="_idIndexMarker355"/> snapshot, click on the <strong class="bold">Add Snapshot</strong> button in the top-right corner of the workspace to open the panel shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.5_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.5 – Jira Align strategic snapshot details"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.5 – Jira Align strategic snapshot details</p>
			<p>Next, enter the following snapshot attributes. Note that red squares indicate required fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>Mutants Strategy 2020 - 2021</code>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: Add a detailed description of the strategic snapshot.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Start Date</strong>: Add a start date for the snapshot.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">End Date</strong>: Add an end date for the snapshot.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Total Budget</strong>: Optionally, add the total budget allocated for the duration of the snapshot.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Horizon Percentages</strong>: Optionally, add <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>a percentage allocation for the following three <a id="_idIndexMarker357"/>horizons: <strong class="bold">Horizon 1: Defend &amp; Extend</strong>, <strong class="bold">Horizon 2: Expand to New Markets</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Horizon 3: Explore Future Options</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After entering the snapshot attributes, click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button and then on the <strong class="bold">Configurations</strong> tab to provide the following optional details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Strategy Team Members</strong>: Add strategy <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>team members, such as the <strong class="bold">LPM</strong> team.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Products</strong>: Add the products associated with the snapshot, if applicable.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Program Increments</strong>: Add the program increments associated with the snapshot. This is recommended, though not required.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Organization Structures</strong>: Add the organization units associated with the snapshot, if applicable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to return to the <strong class="bold">General</strong> tab and then scroll down and click on <strong class="bold">+ Full Details</strong> to expand that section. Here you can set notification preferences, funding approvals, and distribute the total budget across each organization unit tied to the snapshot. Refer to <a href="B16328_03_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Navigating Jira Align</em>, <em class="italic">Figure 3.36</em>, for details on how to set your notifications and funding approval rules.</p>
			<p>Now that we've created the time dimension, let's learn how to manage the other elements that drive <a id="_idIndexMarker359"/>the strategy room. These are found in the<a id="_idIndexMarker360"/> strategic backlog.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor122"/>Strategic backlog</h2>
			<p>Earlier, we mentioned <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>the essential elements of <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>mission, vision, values, and goals. These are part of the strategic hierarchy. To manage these and other elements, click on the <code>Digital Services</code> portfolio:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.6_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.6 – Jira Align strategic backlog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.6 – Jira Align strategic backlog</p>
			<p>Next, recall that a theme is the highest-level work item in Jira Align. By default, it is associated with the lowest-level strategic goal, the yearly goal. As noted earlier, your organization's Jira Align administrator can configure the number of levels of goals and their names.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">While themes are the highest-level work item in Jira Align, they can be grouped into higher-level theme groups for use when filtering reports and views such as the work tree.</p>
			<p class="callout">As a prerequisite, this functionality must be enabled under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio Tab</strong> | <strong class="bold">Enable Theme Groups</strong>.</p>
			<p class="callout">To create a theme group, go to the strategic backlog, click on the <strong class="bold">Theme Group</strong> level on the left, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Add New</strong> button. Alternatively, the Jira Align administrator can create theme groups under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Setup</strong> |<strong class="bold"> Theme Groups</strong>.</p>
			<p>To add a new <a id="_idIndexMarker363"/>goal to <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>the strategic backlog, click on a goal level on the left and then click on the <strong class="bold">Add New</strong> button to open the details panel shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.7_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.7 – Jira Align new goal"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.7 – Jira Align new goal</p>
			<p>Here we add a<a id="_idIndexMarker365"/> yearly goal for the <strong class="bold">Corporate Strategy 2020</strong> snapshot <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>by entering the following details. Note that red boxes in the screenshot indicate required fields:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: Add a description to summarize your goal. </li>
				<li><code>Corporate Strategy 2020</code>. </li>
				<li><code>Yearly Goals</code>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Owner</strong>: Assign the goal to an individual who will be responsible for monitoring status and progress.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Long Term Strategy</strong>: Link the goal to a parent goal. In this case, the parent of a yearly goal is a long-term strategy.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Analysis</strong>: Record the estimated <strong class="bold">Complete %</strong>, and, on a scale of 1 to 10, the goal's <strong class="bold">Importance</strong> to the organization, and <strong class="bold">Feasibility</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Measurement</strong>: Add the success criteria that will be used to measure the completeness of your goal.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Target</strong>: Add the <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>target date for the goal's<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> completion.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Competitive / Market Assessment</strong>: Add the relevant competitive or market analysis.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Attachments</strong>: Add any attachments related to the goal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Once these details have been entered, click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to add the goal. Clicking on <strong class="bold">Save</strong> will also provide additional sections at the bottom of the details panel, where the following optional information can be added:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key Results</strong>: Add key results that will be used to measure the success of the goal. Note that you can associate key results with any level of goal or objective. By definition, a goal or objective with key results may be considered an OKR.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Themes</strong>: Associate the goal with themes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Links</strong>: Add external links related to the goal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we've learned how to add goals, let's see how to manage portfolio objectives. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor123"/>Portfolio objectives</h2>
			<p>Objectives represent work item outcomes at each level of scale: team, program, solution, and <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>portfolio. You can access the objectives <a id="_idIndexMarker370"/>grid for each level via the navigation menu. We previously learned in <a href="B16328_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Program Planning Challenges</em>, how team objectives reflect quarterly planning goals and are aggregated up to the program level. Here we explore portfolio-level objectives as a prelude to the next section, where we will cover key portfolio concepts in detail.</p>
			<p>Let's begin by going to the navigation menu and selecting <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio Objectives</strong> to open the grid shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.8_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.8 – Jira Align objectives grid"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.8 – Jira Align objectives grid</p>
			<p>Here we see portfolio objectives that are associated with the <code>Digital Services</code> portfolio and <code>PI-5</code>. Click on an objective's ID or name to open its details panel. Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Objective</strong> button in the top-right corner of the workspace to add a new objective. </p>
			<p>Objectives are arranged in a hierarchy that is visible in the objectives tree. To access it, click on the <strong class="bold">Objectives Tree</strong> button above the objective grid to the right of center, or go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Enterprise</strong> | <strong class="bold">Objectives Tree</strong>. In the following screenshot, we see the hierarchy from the portfolio level down for the <strong class="bold">Increase Customer Lifetime Value</strong> portfolio objective:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.9_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.9 – Jira Align objectives tree"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.9 – Jira Align objectives tree</p>
			<p>Here we see the selected portfolio objective at the top of the hierarchy, with its linked objectives at each<a id="_idIndexMarker371"/> level, from solution to program, down<a id="_idIndexMarker372"/> to the team level.</p>
			<p>The blue bar on top of each card indicates the cumulative progress of associated key results. Hovering over a card and clicking on one of its sides allows you to collapse or expand neighboring cards to configure the objectives tree for your needs. You can switch from the tree hierarchy to a list view, as described in <a href="B16328_05_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor079"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Program Planning Challenges</em>, <em class="italic">Figure 5.27</em>.</p>
			<p>Now that we've seen how enterprise strategy is set in the strategy room and connects through the portfolio down to team-level execution, let's explore a modern approach to mitigating traditional portfolio-level challenges.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-122"><a id="_idTextAnchor124"/>Implementing LPM</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">LPM</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker373"/>a core competency of SAFe that seeks to align strategy with execution by applying lean and systems thinking approaches to three areas: strategy and investment funding, agile portfolio operations, and governance. LPM has grown in popularity since SAFe introduced its LPM certification in fall 2019. It provides methods for overcoming the challenges of traditional portfolio management approaches, which are inadequate in this age of software and digital disruption when companies operate under greater uncertainty while driven to deliver more innovative solutions faster to market. In this section, we uncover several portfolio management challenges and how Jira Align supports LPM practices to overcome them.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-123"><a id="_idTextAnchor125"/>Identifying value streams</h2>
			<p>A prerequisite for LPM is the identification of value streams. Generally speaking, SAFe defines a value stream as a long-lived series of steps used to create value, from concept to the delivery of a tangible result for the customer. Within this general definition, there are two kinds of value streams – operational and development. Operational value streams deliver end customer value, while development value streams build the systems and capabilities that enable operational value streams.</p>
			<p>For example, one of the steps in a music company's operational value stream is to bring the music to market using traditional and digital marketing methods. We thus identified a development value stream<a id="_idIndexMarker374"/> for digital marketing aligned with a single program team that delivered systems<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> for online fan engagement contests, social media marketing campaigns, delivery of digital marketing assets to business partners, and so on.</p>
			<p>A word of caution about the phrase <em class="italic">value stream</em> – it can be ambiguous, as it is used in different ways in different contexts. Hereinafter, when we use the phrase, we are referring to development value streams. SAFe itself has complicated the issue by calling what is now the large solution level the "value stream" level in SAFe 4.0. Jira Align, too, adds to the confusion by referring to the process steps that drive kanban boards as a "value stream." Therefore, we have changed <strong class="bold">Value stream</strong> to <strong class="bold">Process steps</strong> in our platform terminology. </p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">To avoid confusion over terminology in Jira Align, we recommend changing <strong class="bold">Value stream</strong> to <strong class="bold">Process steps</strong> under <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform Terminology</strong>.</p>
			<p>In SAFe 5.0, value streams exist at the portfolio level and are broad-reaching. In this sense, they are akin to themes, although they are not objective-based, like SAFe themes, nor are they work items, like Jira Align themes. Even so, since a value stream object doesn't exist, at least currently, in Jira Align, reporting based on themes, such as the Investment by Theme report, could serve as a reasonable substitute for value stream budgeting in Jira Align. It's admittedly a workaround, but it allows you to capture broad budget allocations and apportion budget by percentage across multiple items. We will examine<a id="_idIndexMarker376"/> this<a id="_idIndexMarker377"/> report shortly.</p>
			<p>Now that we have a handle on value streams, we can discuss the group that manages them – the portfolio.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-124"><a id="_idTextAnchor126"/>Defining the portfolio </h2>
			<p>A typical portfolio<a id="_idIndexMarker378"/> management challenge is that people<a id="_idIndexMarker379"/> are organized in functional silos, creating excessive dependencies and lag time. LPM organizes people around value and applies cadence-based planning to improve the flow of value and innovation. It shifts the approach from functional silos and temporary project teams to long-lived program teams delivering a continuous stream of value. In short, it brings the work to the people, not the people to the work. </p>
			<p>In SAFe, a portfolio is a collection of development value streams, each of which builds, maintains, and supports solutions delivered to either internal or external customers. A helpful tool when discovering and defining value streams is the value stream canvas. Jira Align makes creating them easy. To create a value stream canvas, go to the navigation menu and then select <strong class="bold">Enterprise</strong> | <strong class="bold">Canvas</strong>. Next, give your canvas a name and select <strong class="bold">Value Stream Canvas</strong> from the template dropdown, as shown in the following screenshot, before clicking on the <strong class="bold">Create new Canvas</strong> button:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.10_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.10 – Jira Align – Create your canvas"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.10 – Jira Align – Create your canvas</p>
			<p>There are three variations when organizing people around value: one value stream per program, many<a id="_idIndexMarker380"/> value streams per program, and many<a id="_idIndexMarker381"/> programs per value stream. From a tooling perspective, the first is the easiest, since you can simply use program budgets as value stream budgets, whereas the other two require the tracking of additional attributes in order to allocate budget across value streams.</p>
			<p>To see program budgets in Jira Align, open the portfolio room financials view by going to the navigation menu and then selecting <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio Room</strong>. Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Extra Configs</strong> button in the top-right corner of the workspace and then select a strategic snapshot. The right panel of the portfolio room will then display key information, including program budgets, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.11_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.11 – Jira Align portfolio room, right panel"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.11 – Jira Align portfolio room, right panel</p>
			<p>Here we see<a id="_idIndexMarker382"/> the<a id="_idIndexMarker383"/> following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Total Budget</strong>: Displays the <a id="_idIndexMarker384"/>value set in the <strong class="bold">Total Budget</strong> field of the selected strategic snapshot. The circle graph displays the actual spend to date, calculated from points on accepted stories, as a percentage of the total snapshot budget.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Portfolio(s) Summary</strong>: Displays the rollup of PI budgets tied to programs in the portfolio as a percentage of the total snapshot budget.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Program summary</strong>: Displays the sum of the budgets in each program of the portfolio, in terms of story-level estimates and actuals, converted to dollars based on team velocity and a blended rate.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is just one facet of the portfolio room. For more information, refer to <a href="https://help.jiraalign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000095234-10X-Portfolio-Room">https://help.jiraalign.com/hc/en-us/articles/115000095234-10X-Portfolio-Room</a>.</p>
			<p>As previously mentioned, the Investment by Theme report can be useful for budgeting programs and/or value streams. It shows how the portfolio allocates budget and effort to implement business strategy via themes. To access it, go to the navigation menu and then select <code>Mobile</code> program <a id="_idIndexMarker386"/>and <code>PI-5</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.12_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.12 – Jira Align investment by theme report"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.12 – Jira Align investment by theme report</p>
			<p>The left pie chart shows how the portfolio apportioned the budget across themes. This is done by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Manage Investments</strong> button in the top-right corner of the workspace to open the <strong class="bold">Theme Planning View</strong> panel, where you can set the percentage of the total PI investment for each theme. The right chart shows the actual distribution of effort, enabling portfolio leadership to see how closely actual execution aligns with planned budget allocations.</p>
			<p>The bottom section of the report lists the in-progress themes, with progress bars showing the percent complete. Hover over the bars for details. The count of competed epics and stand-alone features for each theme is listed to the right of the progress bars. Hover over the counts for details.</p>
			<p>Another useful budget report is Investments vs. Actuals, which shows the PI allocation, estimated spend, and actual spend per theme in one report. To access it, go to the navigation menu and then select <code>Digital Services</code> portfolio and <code>PI-5</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.13_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.13 – Jira Align investment vs. actuals report"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.13 – Jira Align investment vs. actuals report</p>
			<p>Let's examine the<a id="_idIndexMarker389"/> three <a id="_idIndexMarker390"/>charts from left to right:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Budget</strong>: The value above the chart represents either the program increment budget or the sum of portfolio epic budgets, depending on the setting made by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Extra Configs</strong> button at the top right of the workspace. The chart shows the same percentage allocation across themes we saw previously, which is set by going to the Investment by Theme report and clicking on the <strong class="bold">Manage Investments</strong> button. Hover over the segments of the pie chart to see the dollar values.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Estimate</strong>: The value above the chart is the sum of estimated portfolio epic costs based on total story points in the PI and cost per point. Cost per point is derived from the average team cost per sprint divided by average velocity. The chart shows each theme's estimated portfolio epic costs for the PI as a percentage of the total estimated portfolio epic costs for the PI. Hover over the segments of the<a id="_idIndexMarker391"/> pie chart to see the dollar<a id="_idIndexMarker392"/> values.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Actual</strong>: The value above the chart is the sum of actual story costs for accepted stories connected to portfolio epics in the PI based on total story points and cost per point. Cost per point is derived from the average team cost per sprint divided by average velocity. The chart shows each theme's actual story costs as a percentage of the total actual story costs for the PI. Hover over each segment of the pie chart to see the dollar values.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The bottom section of the report shows several other data points for each theme, including variance, allocation, cost, and work. Now that we've seen some useful reports for portfolio leadership to plan and monitor investments, let's see how the portfolio connects execution to enterprise strategy.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-125"><a id="_idTextAnchor127"/>Connecting the portfolio to enterprise strategy</h2>
			<p>Enterprise strategy<a id="_idIndexMarker393"/> is<a id="_idIndexMarker394"/> formed <a id="_idIndexMarker395"/>on the basis of several inputs, including mission, vision, and values; business drivers; financial goals; and competitive analysis. The outputs of enterprise strategy are portfolio budgets and strategic themes. </p>
			<p>In SAFe, themes are differentiating business objectives that drive the future state of the portfolio, connect the portfolio to enterprise strategy, and provide context for the portfolio vision and lean budgeting. According to SAFe, they are best described in the form of OKRs, with the objective being the theme, and the key results being the quantifiable measures of the theme's progress. While SAFe considers themes a type of objective, we follow the approach supported by Jira Align, where the theme represents a large work item and the OKR represents its corresponding business outcomes. This provides a consistent approach, documented in <a href="B16328_02_Final_NM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor025"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Implementing Jira Align</em>, <em class="italic">Figure 2.9</em>, where each level of scale has a set of people, work, time, and outcome dimensions. </p>
			<p>The following<a id="_idIndexMarker396"/> screenshot provides an example of how themes in Jira Align correspond to OKRs:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.14_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.14 – Jira Align OKR linked to a theme"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.14 – Jira Align OKR linked to a theme</p>
			<p>Here, we've set a yearly goal to "<strong class="bold">Increase fan engagement in the Superheroes mobile app</strong>" and associated key results and a theme with it.</p>
			<p>A key function of LPM<a id="_idIndexMarker397"/> is to provide clarity on the<a id="_idIndexMarker398"/> direction and purpose of work in order to<a id="_idIndexMarker399"/> connect strategy to execution. Clarity enables decentralized decision making to improve the flow of value at each level of scale. OKRs, such as the yearly goal in the previous screenshot, help encapsulate the direction and purpose driving the work.</p>
			<p>Themes and their corresponding OKRs influence portfolio strategy and provide context for decision making. They influence the portfolio vision; portfolio epic backlog and kanban; program, solution, and team-level backlogs; value stream budgets; and lean budget guardrails. Let's now examine portfolio vision.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-126"><a id="_idTextAnchor128"/>Maintaining the portfolio vision</h2>
			<p>In SAFe, the portfolio canvas defines the portfolio's domain and development value streams and is a key input for creating and maintaining the portfolio vision. Jira Align makes creating a portfolio canvas easy. Begin by going to the navigation menu and selecting <strong class="bold">Enterprise</strong> | <strong class="bold">Canvas</strong>. Then name your canvas and choose <strong class="bold">Portfolio Canvas</strong> from the list before clicking on the <strong class="bold">Create new Canvas</strong> button. This will open a blank canvas with empty content blocks. In the following screenshot, we have created a portfolio canvas for the <strong class="bold">Mutants</strong> portfolio: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.15_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.15 – Jira Align portfolio canvas&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.15 – Jira Align portfolio canvas</p>
			<p>Here we see several<a id="_idIndexMarker400"/> content blocks for <a id="_idIndexMarker401"/>defining the portfolio's value proposition, value streams, budget, and much more. Hover over a block to perform the following actions to configure the look and feel of your canvas:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Edit the title.</li>
				<li>Change the background color.</li>
				<li>Change the icon.</li>
				<li>Add content, including a link.</li>
				<li>Select a state to reflect content status: <strong class="bold">Not Started</strong>, <strong class="bold">In Progress</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Done</strong>. The states appear as color-coded icons (gray, red, and green, respectively) when you click on the <strong class="bold">Toggle View</strong> button near the top-right corner of the workspace to toggle from <strong class="bold">full</strong> to <strong class="bold">note</strong> view.</li>
				<li>Drag and drop to move the block or adjust its size.</li>
				<li>Delete the block.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To create a content block, click on the <strong class="bold">Add Block</strong> button near the top-right corner of the workspace. Then, click on the <strong class="bold">More Actions</strong> button at the top of the workspace, right of center, to access the following options: click on <strong class="bold">Edit Canvas</strong> to rename the canvas, <strong class="bold">Delete Canvas</strong> to remove it, or <strong class="bold">Create new Canvas</strong>. Note that if you delete a canvas, it cannot be recovered. You can open an existing canvas by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Open Existing Canvas</strong> button in the top-right corner of the workspace.</p>
			<p>Now that we know how to <a id="_idIndexMarker402"/>create a portfolio canvas, let's see how the portfolio can leverage lean <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>budgets to improve outcomes.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-127"><a id="_idTextAnchor129"/>Establishing lean budgets and guardrails</h2>
			<p>A typical<a id="_idIndexMarker404"/> challenge of the traditional<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> project funding approach <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>is that <a id="_idIndexMarker407"/>it causes friction, overhead, and delays. LPM solves this by funding value streams, guided by budget guardrails, to increase the speed of value delivery.</p>
			<p>One of the guardrails is to guide investments by horizon. SAFe recommends the following horizons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Horizon 3 – Exploring</strong>: Investment to evaluate potential new solutions.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Horizon 2 – Emerging</strong>: Solutions that emerged from horizon 3.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Horizon 1</strong>: Solutions that deliver more value than their cost. There are two subcategories of horizon 1:<p><strong class="bold">Investing</strong>: Solutions that require significant ongoing investment</p><p><strong class="bold">Extracting</strong>: Stable solutions that deliver high value with minimal new investment</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Horizon 0 – Retiring</strong>: Investment to decommission solutions.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We recommend that the<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> Jira Align administrator adds the preceding horizons to <a id="_idIndexMarker409"/>the <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver</strong> dropdown on the portfolio epic details panel. To do so, the administrator would go to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> and then click on the <strong class="bold">Dropdowns</strong> tab and select <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver</strong> to manage the field values.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">The standard <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver</strong> drop-down values are <strong class="bold">Innovate</strong>, <strong class="bold">Expand</strong>, <strong class="bold">Sustain</strong>, <strong class="bold">Contain</strong>, <strong class="bold">Exit</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Unknown</strong>. We recommend renaming the existing values to identify the horizons as follows:</p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Horizon 3 - Innovate</strong></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Horizon 2 - Expand</strong></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Horizon 1 - Sustain</strong></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Horizon 1 - Contain</strong></p>
			<p class="callout"><strong class="bold">Horizon 0 - Exit</strong></p>
			<p>Setting up<a id="_idIndexMarker410"/> investment horizons in this<a id="_idIndexMarker411"/> way enables several helpful visualizations <a id="_idIndexMarker412"/>for the LPM function that we'll explore shortly. Before we<a id="_idIndexMarker413"/> do, note that Jira Align has a standard dropdown called <strong class="bold">Strategic Horizon</strong>. However, there are three disadvantages to using this when capturing investment horizons:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It has only three options and these are not editable: Defend &amp; Extend; Expand to New Markets; and Explore Future Options.</li>
				<li>You cannot group a portfolio epic roadmap according to these fields, as you can for <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver</strong>.</li>
				<li>You cannot generate a report according to these fields as you can for <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Therefore, we recommend using <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver</strong> for horizons. To see the horizons in the portfolio epic backlog, go to <strong class="bold">Columns Shown</strong> | <strong class="bold">Portfolio Epic</strong> and select <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.16_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.16 – Jira Align portfolio epic backlog with Strategic Driver"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.16 – Jira Align portfolio epic backlog with Strategic Driver</p>
			<p>To create a <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>portfolio epic roadmap by <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>horizon, you need to perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Go to the<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> navigation <a id="_idIndexMarker417"/>menu and select <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Roadmaps</strong>. Be sure that PIs are selected in the configuration bar and that <strong class="bold">Work</strong> and <strong class="bold">Portfolio Epics</strong> are selected from the dropdowns. </li>
				<li>Next, click on the <strong class="bold">View Configuration</strong> button at the top of the workspace, right of center.</li>
				<li>Then, click on the <strong class="bold">Other Options</strong> tab and select <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver</strong> under <strong class="bold">Group By Property</strong>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>You will now have a roadmap of portfolio epics grouped by horizon, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.17_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.17 – Jira Align portfolio epic roadmap with Strategic Driver"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.17 – Jira Align portfolio epic roadmap with Strategic Driver</p>
			<p>Note that roadmap swim lanes are grouped by strategic drivers that reflect the horizons on the left. A prerequisite is that a strategic driver must be selected in the <a id="_idIndexMarker418"/>details<a id="_idIndexMarker419"/> panel for<a id="_idIndexMarker420"/> each <a id="_idIndexMarker421"/>portfolio epic.</p>
			<p>Another budget guardrail is to determine and apply capacity allocation by activity type. Jira Align supports capturing the activity type at the feature work item level by using the category field. The standard categories are <strong class="bold">Customer Funded</strong>, <strong class="bold">Grow / Protect Base</strong>, <strong class="bold">Innovation</strong>, <strong class="bold">New Market / Product</strong>, <strong class="bold">R&amp;D</strong>, <strong class="bold">Tech Investment</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Technical Debt</strong>. The Jira Align administrator can edit this list by going to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> and then clicking on the <strong class="bold">Dropdowns</strong> tab and selecting <strong class="bold">Feature Category</strong>. Note, too, that categories must be enabled by going to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Details Panels Settings</strong>, selecting the portfolio from the <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> dropdown, and <strong class="bold">Feature</strong> from the <strong class="bold">Work Item</strong> dropdown, and then sliding on the <strong class="bold">Category</strong> toggle.</p>
			<p>To see the percentage allocation by horizon, go to the navigation menu, click on the <code>strategic driver</code>. Click on the search result to open <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver Report</strong> as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.18_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.18 – Jira Align – Strategic Driver Report"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.18 – Jira Align – Strategic Driver Report</p>
			<p>Here you see the PI's <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>planned, estimated, and <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>actual allocations for each <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>strategic driver. This enables portfolio leadership to <a id="_idIndexMarker425"/>determine whether the planned strategic allocation for the work is aligned with the work the teams are actually doing or planning on doing. For example, if leadership planned to spend 25% of the quarterly effort on expanding to new markets and the chart indicates that only 10% will be spent, then the portfolio could miss its revenue targets. </p>
			<p>The left chart is based on the percentage allocations set in the PI details panel. To set these, go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Program Increments</strong>. Next, click on a PI in the grid to open its details panel. Finally, click on <strong class="bold">+ Full Details</strong> and then on <strong class="bold">Manage Strategic Driver allocations</strong>.</p>
			<p>The middle chart is based on portfolio epic estimates for the PI and the right chart is based on actual story points for accepted stories connected to portfolio epics in the PI. Further details below the charts include portfolio epics by horizon with progress bars. Hover over the progress bars for details. The report also displays an allocation trend across PIs when <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>multiple PIs are selected in the <a id="_idIndexMarker427"/>configuration bar. This can<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> be seen<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> by scrolling down.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">If your report search didn't return the Strategic Driver report, you can ask your Jira Align administrator to enable the report for your role.</p>
			<p class="callout">To do so, the administrator would go to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Access Controls</strong> | <strong class="bold">Roles</strong>, select your role, click on <strong class="bold">Additional Options</strong> to expand the section, and then toggle on the <strong class="bold">Strategic Driver Allocation</strong> option under <strong class="bold">Reports</strong>.</p>
			<p>Another budget guardrail of LPM is that approval is required for significant initiatives, in other words, portfolio epics. The portfolio's vision is realized through portfolio epics. Continuous business owner engagement is also encouraged. This can be formalized in regularly occurring meetings such as the portfolio sync recommended by SAFe.</p>
			<p>The traditional <a id="_idIndexMarker430"/>categories <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>of <strong class="bold">capitalizable expenses</strong> (<strong class="bold">CapEx</strong>) and <strong class="bold">operational expenses</strong> (<strong class="bold">OpEx</strong>) are still relevant when using LPM. Jira Align supports tracking CapEx at the portfolio epic level. To designate a portfolio epic as CapEx, go to the portfolio epic's details panel and click on <strong class="bold">+ Full Details</strong> to see the <strong class="bold">Capitalized</strong> dropdown. Select <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> for CapEx:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.19_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.19 – Jira Align portfolio epic – Capitalized"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.19 – Jira Align portfolio epic – Capitalized</p>
			<p>You can add this column to your portfolio epic backlog by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Columns Shown</strong> button at the top of the backlog workspace, and then clicking on the <strong class="bold">Portfolio Epic</strong> tab and selecting the <strong class="bold">Capitalized</strong> checkbox. In order to add the planned budget totals for CapEx and OpEx to the portfolio epic, click on the <strong class="bold">Finance</strong> tab in the details panel, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.20_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.20 – Jira Align portfolio epic – Finance"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.20 – Jira Align portfolio epic – Finance</p>
			<p>Here you can enter <a id="_idIndexMarker432"/>and track the CapEx and OpEx <a id="_idIndexMarker433"/>data. A useful visualization of<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> this data is the status report, financials view. To <a id="_idIndexMarker435"/>access it, go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Enterprise</strong> | <strong class="bold">Track</strong> | <strong class="bold">Status Reports</strong>. Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> button and then on your portfolio. Finally, click on the <strong class="bold">View Financials</strong> button near the top-right corner of the workspace. </p>
			<p>The status report, financials view provides portfolio epic financials, status, and health information broken down by program for the PI(s) selected in the configuration bar. Click on a program, portfolio epic, or its associated theme to drill down for more information. There are numerous columns of data, so you will need to scroll horizontally to see the CapEx and OpEx columns shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Now that we've<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> explored portfolio budget <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>reports and guardrails, let's<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> see<a id="_idIndexMarker439"/> how to establish portfolio flow.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-128"><a id="_idTextAnchor130"/>Establishing portfolio flow</h2>
			<p>Another challenge of<a id="_idIndexMarker440"/> traditional <a id="_idIndexMarker441"/>portfolio<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> management is that poor control of demand and <strong class="bold">work in process</strong> (<strong class="bold">WIP</strong>) reduces throughput. LPM's solution is to match demand to capacity to increase the flow of value.</p>
			<p>The portfolio kanban enables the LPM function to match demand to capacity based on WIP limits, visualize bottlenecks in each process step, and identify opportunities for relentless improvement. The kanban also includes policies governing the entry and exit of portfolio epics in each process step.</p>
			<p>To create a portfolio kanban, you'll first need to specify the underlying process steps. To begin, go to the navigation menu, select <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Process Steps</strong>, and then click on <a id="_idIndexMarker443"/>the <strong class="bold">Add Process Steps</strong> button to<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> open the panel shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.22 – Jira Align portfolio – New Process Steps</p>
			<p>Next, enter the following details:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Name</strong>: Add a meaningful name to your portfolio kanban.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Type</strong>: Select one of the two following types:<p><strong class="bold">Developmental</strong>: Steps required to develop new products, systems, or services capabilities. Choosing this option will allow you to map process steps to Jira Align's work item states. This is the standard option to use most of the time.</p><p><strong class="bold">Operational</strong>: Steps required to provide goods or services to a customer, whether internal or external. This could be useful when modeling future business operations, but is rarely used.</p><p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p><p class="callout">If you don't see the <strong class="bold">Operational</strong> type in the dropdown, ask the Jira Align administrator to enable operational value streams. </p><p class="callout">To do so, the administrator would go to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong>, click on the <strong class="bold">Solution</strong> tab, set the <strong class="bold">Enable Operational Process Steps</strong> dropdown to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Save Settings</strong> button.</p></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Level</strong>: Select <a id="_idIndexMarker445"/>the work item level – theme, portfolio<a id="_idIndexMarker446"/> epic, capability, feature, or story. Here, we will choose <strong class="bold">Portfolio Epic</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team Description</strong>: Add a description of the team responsible for the kanban.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Region</strong>: Select a region applicable to the kanban.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Active</strong>: Specify whether the kanban is active and available to use.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Map to State</strong>: If you chose the <strong class="bold">Developmental</strong> type, then you can toggle this on to map process steps to work item states.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In addition, you can add the following optional information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Customer(s)</strong>: List the relevant customers.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Triggers</strong>: Specify the events that trigger the flow of value; for example, a customer places an order or requests a new feature. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Inputs</strong>: Specify any necessary inputs.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Outputs</strong>: List any relevant outputs.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Includes</strong>: Provide additional information in terms of the scope of the process steps.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Finally, click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button. You will now see the <strong class="bold">Process Steps</strong> tab, where you can add steps for your<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> kanban and link them to<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> states, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.23_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.23 – Jira Align portfolio – Process Steps"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.23 – Jira Align portfolio – Process Steps</p>
			<p>Here, we've added the portfolio kanban steps recommended by SAFe and mapped them to Jira Align work item states. For example, <strong class="bold">Funnel</strong> is mapped to <strong class="bold">1 - Not Started</strong>. Note that if a process step maps to a functional area of your organization, you can select it from the dropdown to the right of the work item state; however, this is rarely used.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">To maintain the list of functional areas, go to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Setup</strong> | <strong class="bold">Functional Areas</strong>.</p>

			<p>Here we are editing the <code>40</code> as the estimated process step time in <strong class="bold">Hours</strong>. These are used to measure efficiency, defined as the total estimated hours for steps divided by the total actual hours for steps, visible in the Work in Process report.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">To see the process step metrics, including efficiency, go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Track</strong> | <strong class="bold">Work in Process</strong>.

			<p class="callout">Finally, select your kanban name from the <strong class="bold">Process Steps</strong> dropdown and then expand it by clicking on the right-pointing angle symbol. You can select multiple kanbans for display and then expand or collapse them.</p>
			<p class="callout">At the top of each swim lane, you will see <strong class="bold">Efficiency</strong>, discussed earlier, as well as <strong class="bold">Throughput</strong> (count of items that have moved into the final step in the last 30 days) and <strong class="bold">Cycle Time</strong> (average number of hours it took the items, within the last 30 days, to move to the final step).</p>
			<p>Next, notice that<a id="_idIndexMarker451"/> we added a list of four <strong class="bold">Exit Criteria</strong> for<a id="_idIndexMarker452"/> the <strong class="bold">Reviewing </strong>process step, mapped it to the <strong class="bold">1 - Not Started</strong> state, and toggled on email notifications.

Finally, click on the <strong class="bold">Members</strong> tab to add team members for <strong class="bold">Digital Services Portfolio Team</strong> and then click on the <strong class="bold">Save &amp; Close</strong> button.</p>
			<p>Now that we have created the process steps, we can view the portfolio kanban to visualize portfolio flow. This is often done during the portfolio sync, a cadence-based event for reviewing and managing the epics on the portfolio kanban board. The advancement of each portfolio epic through the process steps on the kanban is coordinated by the epic owner. </p>
			<p>To view the portfolio kanban, begin at the portfolio epic backlog by going to the navigation menu and selecting <strong class="bold">Portfolio</strong> | <strong class="bold">Backlog</strong>. Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Kanban</strong> button near the top-right corner of the workspace and then select the <strong class="bold">Process Step View</strong> option to view the kanban board, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Here we <a id="_idIndexMarker453"/>are <a id="_idIndexMarker454"/>viewing the kanban for the <strong class="bold">Digital Services</strong> portfolio. You may set your context in the configuration bar to filter by program and/or program increment. Note that we toggled on the <strong class="bold">Show Exit Criteria</strong> option near the top of the workspace to the right of center. This displays the exit criteria we added earlier for each process step. Click on the <strong class="bold">Card Size</strong> button and then select <strong class="bold">Normal</strong>, <strong class="bold">Small</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Heat Map View</strong>. Click on the arrows on each column to collapse or expand them to better visualize the end-to-end flow. In the preceding screenshot, we collapsed the <strong class="bold">Unassigned</strong> column.</p>
			<p>Now that we can visualize the portfolio flow, let's view the <em class="italic">Process Step Cycle Time</em> report to evaluate how the portfolio epics are flowing through the process steps. To access the report, go to the navigation menu, click on the search icon (magnifying glass), search for <code>Process Step Cycle Time</code>, and then click on the result. Next, select the kanban name from the <strong class="bold">Process Steps</strong> dropdown and enter a date range in the corresponding fields. Note that the date range is automatically populated when you have a PI selected in the configuration bar. This will generate the report shown in the following <a id="_idIndexMarker455"/>screenshot:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process Step Cycle Time</strong>: The bar chart shows the average time work items spend in each process step. Below the bar chart is a line chart that allows you to change the date range by clicking and dragging to highlight the time period you'd like to see. You can then click on the <strong class="bold">Reset Zoom</strong> button in the top-right corner to reset the timeline.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process Step WIP</strong>: Another bar chart that shows the average number of work items in each process step. Below is a line chart plotting the number of work items in each process step over time. Click and drag on the line chart to highlight the time period you'd like to see and then click on the <strong class="bold">Reset Zoom</strong> button in the top-right corner to reset the timeline.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cycle Time Control Chart</strong>: Displays the following information in the form of a line chart:<p><strong class="bold">Rolling Average</strong>: The average number of days all work items have been in process steps on the kanban, for that specific date.</p><p><strong class="bold">Overall Average</strong>: The sum of all rolling averages from each day divided by the number of days in the chart.</p><p><strong class="bold">Completed Work Items</strong>: The sum of days spent within process steps divided by the number of work items completed on that day. A work item is completed when it is moved into the final process step.</p></li>
			</ul>
			<p>The report helps to<a id="_idIndexMarker457"/> identify bottlenecks and delays where <a id="_idIndexMarker458"/>work items are remaining in a process step for too long. It establishes an understanding of the end-to-end delivery process and how it can be improved in terms of velocity, quality, and time to market.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-129"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Applying lean governance</h2>
			<p>The final challenge<a id="_idIndexMarker459"/> associated with traditional <a id="_idIndexMarker460"/>portfolio management that we will mention in this section is that annual planning and rigid budget cycles impede the ability to respond to change. The practice of big, upfront planning and budgeting of portfolio epics is ineffective, often causing work items to become irrelevant by the time they're delivered. </p>
			<p>LPM's solution is rolling wave planning and dynamic budgeting to enable rapid response to change. One aspect of this approach is to budget only the portion of a portfolio epic required to validate a hypothesis. For example, the hypothesis that epic delivery will result in enhanced security can be proven by fewer security breaches. We will discuss this aspect further in the next section.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Promoting innovation</h1>
			<p>Organizations of all <a id="_idIndexMarker461"/>sizes seek to innovate like a start-up in the quest for true business agility. The methods outlined in <em class="italic">The Lean Startup</em>, by <em class="italic">Eric Reis</em> (2011), have gained credibility and popularity over the years. For example, SAFe has incorporated them into its LPM approach. Simply put, the lean startup cycle of build-measure-learn fosters innovation.</p>
			<p>When following SAFe, the lean startup cycle begins with a newly defined portfolio epic and hypothesis <a id="_idIndexMarker462"/>statement. A <strong class="bold">minimum viable product</strong> (<strong class="bold">MVP</strong>) is then defined for the epic. The MVP represents the smallest portion of the portfolio epic needed to understand whether or not the hypothesis statement is validated. The MVP flows through the portfolio kanban to the <strong class="bold">Implementing</strong> state. Based on whether or not the MVP has proven the hypothesis, the portfolio team then decides to either pivot to a new portfolio epic and hypothesis or persevere and continue developing the portfolio epic. When the portfolio team's oversight is no longer required, they move the portfolio epic to the <strong class="bold">Done</strong> state.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">SAFe provides the epic hypothesis statement as a Word template. You can easily select all content from the Word template and then paste it into a web-based wiki such as Confluence. You can then add a link to the epic hypothesis statement in the portfolio epic details panel, under the links section.</p>
			<p>Jira Align visualizes the flow of value on the portfolio epic kanban and provides advanced functionality for tracking the MVP from the hypothesis statement to the decision to pivot or persevere. The focus is on outcomes over outputs. To track and measure outcomes, open a portfolio epic's details panel, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Value</strong> tab, shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.27_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.27 – Jira Align Value Engineering hypothesis"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.27 – Jira Align Value Engineering hypothesis</p>
			<p>This tab provides strong <a id="_idIndexMarker463"/>support for value engineering. It allows you to define a hypothesis and, with minimal investment, ensure that the work is delivering the desired outcome. If not, it provides the opportunity to pivot away. </p>
			<p>In this example, we believe we can validate our hypothesis with a research cost of $<code>300,000</code> and a build cost of $<code>1,100,000</code>. We can begin to conduct the research and track our spending against the budget by adding expenses, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.28_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.28 – Jira Align Value Engineering bet"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.28 – Jira Align Value Engineering bet</p>
			<p>This allows us to track<a id="_idIndexMarker464"/> our actual development costs and compare them to the value being realized. Portfolio leadership can cast their vote daily to decide whether we should continue on to the validate phase. Once we move to the next phase, we can decide whether we should pivot or continue investing and persevere:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.29 – Jira Align Value Engineering pivot/persevere</p>
			<p>Jira Align automatically<a id="_idIndexMarker465"/> calculates the cost to deliver a story point, and rolls that cost up to the feature and then portfolio epic to tell us that we've spent <strong class="bold">$694,890</strong> thus far in delivering <strong class="bold">341</strong> story points and realized <strong class="bold">$480,000</strong> in value. </p>
			<p>This measure of value here<a id="_idIndexMarker466"/> is not revenue, but rather a <strong class="bold">net promoter score</strong> (<strong class="bold">NPS</strong>) because, in the hypothesis phase, we associated a dollar value with each incremental point of increase in the NPS. We can analyze the performance of not only this particular portfolio epic, but of all the portfolio epics we're developing, and then have the opportunity to pivot or persevere as appropriate.</p>
			<p>Now that we've learned how to track and measure MVPs from hypothesis to pivot or persevere, let's step back to see how new ideas can be collected directly from our customers and from <a id="_idIndexMarker467"/>people throughout our organization. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Collecting ideas</h2>
			<p>Jira Align's ideation <a id="_idIndexMarker468"/>module allows product management to collect ideas for future products and features from customers, both internal and external, and others. Let's begin by going to the navigation menu and selecting <strong class="bold">Product</strong> | <strong class="bold">Ideas</strong> | <strong class="bold">Ideation</strong>. Here you can submit an idea, such as an enhancement request for an existing product, or a question. You can also vote on ideas, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.30_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.30 – Jira Align Ideation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.30 – Jira Align Ideation</p>
			<p>Click on the <strong class="bold">Manage Ideation Users</strong> button near the top-right corner of the workspace to grant or revoke access to the ideation module. Monitor the submission of ideas and voting results by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Key Metrics</strong> button at the top near the center. Share the contents of the workspace by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> button near the top-right corner to generate an internal link.</p>
			<p>A typical ideation process starts with a campaign to collect ideas related to a particular product or product line over a fixed period of time, such as a PI or business quarter. Begin by creating or modifying an existing idea group. To do so, click on the <strong class="bold">Setup</strong> button at the top of the workspace, right of center, to open the group details panel shown in the following<a id="_idIndexMarker469"/> screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.31_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.31 – Jira Align ideation campaign"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.31 – Jira Align ideation campaign</p>
			<p>Note that red squares indicate required fields. To create a new campaign, click on the <strong class="bold">Create New Group</strong> button at the top center of the panel. Click on the <strong class="bold">Disable Group</strong> button to pause or stop the campaign and to reactivate it, and then click on the <strong class="bold">Enable Group</strong> button. The following are the attributes you can enter and track for a campaign group: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Select Group</strong>: Switch between idea groups.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Group Name</strong>: Provide a name for your idea group or campaign.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Category</strong>: Select the category of what you'd like to collect in the campaign: <strong class="bold">Enhancement</strong>, <strong class="bold">Question</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Ticket</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Admins</strong>: Choose who will be administering the campaign.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Ideation Form</strong>: Choose an ideation form or click on the cog button to create a new form or add fields <a id="_idIndexMarker470"/>to an existing form to collect more details.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Internal Contributors</strong>: Select the internal contributors or participants for the campaign.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Make Public</strong>: Enable external access to the idea group. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Approve External Users</strong>: Manage and approve external access to the idea group (the <strong class="bold">Make Public</strong> checkbox must be selected).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">External Link</strong>: When <strong class="bold">Make Public</strong> is selected, a link for you to provide to external users is displayed here.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Make States Public</strong>: Make the idea status visible to external users.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Allow Voting</strong>: Enable voting on ideas. By default, you can either vote up (+1) or down (-1). </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Token Voting</strong>: Enable token-based voting, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 7.30</em>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Max Votes Per Idea</strong>: Set a limit on how many token votes you can cast for an idea (the <strong class="bold">Token Voting</strong> checkbox must be selected).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Total User Tokens</strong>: Set how many tokens will be granted to each user (the <strong class="bold">Token Voting</strong> checkbox must be selected).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save &amp; Close</strong> button to submit changes and return to the workspace. Now, you can create an idea as an internal user by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Add Idea</strong> button in the top-right <a id="_idIndexMarker471"/>corner. This opens the new idea panel shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.32_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.32 – Jira Align new idea"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.32 – Jira Align new idea</p>
			<p>Here you see an idea submitted for the <strong class="bold">Digital Services Ideation Portal</strong> campaign. The following are the default attributes you can enter and track for an idea. These may vary, and others such as <strong class="bold">Product</strong> or <strong class="bold">Customer</strong> may appear depending on the ideation form that was selected for the campaign:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Group</strong>: Select the idea group if you have access to more than one.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Title</strong>: Add a summary of the idea.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: Add more related details.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Contained In</strong>: Displays a link to an associated work item after an idea gets promoted. We'll discuss <a id="_idIndexMarker472"/>promoting an idea shortly.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Created By</strong>: Defaults to the user who creates the idea.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Owner</strong>: Choose who owns the idea.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Status</strong>: Choose <strong class="bold">New</strong> for a new idea that can later move through the following states in the idea backlog: <strong class="bold">Open</strong>, <strong class="bold">Planned</strong>, <strong class="bold">Completed</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Shelved</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Category</strong>: Choose the type of idea: <strong class="bold">Enhancement</strong>, <strong class="bold">Question</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Ticket</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Public</strong>: Make the idea available to external users.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Attachments</strong>: Add attachments to your idea after clicking on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to submit the idea.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Product management and campaign administrators manage ideas in the idea backlog. Click on the <strong class="bold">Manage Backlog</strong> button near the top-right corner of the ideation workspace to open the backlog, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_7.33_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 7.33 – Jira Align ideation backlog"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 7.33 – Jira Align ideation backlog</p>
			<p>Here you can click<a id="_idIndexMarker473"/> and drag ideas to rank them higher or lower and move them through the states on the kanban. Click on the ellipses to promote an idea by converting it to a story, feature, capability, or portfolio epic, as shown in the screenshot, or click on <strong class="bold">More</strong> to assign the idea to a different group or give it a t-shirt size. Filter the kanban by <strong class="bold">Group</strong>, <strong class="bold">Product</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Type</strong> using the dropdowns on the left-hand side. </p>
			<p>In addition to collecting ideas, it is important to create spaces that can nurture an innovation culture. This is key to achieving a state business agility, meaning that the whole organization, not just engineering or development teams, is engaged in continuous and proactive delivery of innovative business solutions faster than the competition. Furthermore, an even greater level of discipline is required given the current trend of remote working, which can create barriers in team collaboration and impede innovation.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">Jira Align provides robust functionalities to support innovation through tools such as <strong class="bold">Mind Maps</strong>, <strong class="bold">Brainstorming</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Innovation</strong>. These create spaces for better team collaboration, which<a id="_idIndexMarker474"/> leads <a id="_idIndexMarker475"/>to a culture of innovation. Access these<a id="_idIndexMarker476"/> modules under the navigation menu's <strong class="bold">Product</strong> | <strong class="bold">Ideas</strong> section.</p>
			<p>Two companies we've discussed throughout this book can perhaps serve as inspiration in this regard. Atlassian nurtures an innovation culture by dedicating a 24-hour team hackathon called <em class="italic">ShipIt</em> every quarter. This event focuses on bringing teams together, improving collaboration, and<a id="_idIndexMarker477"/> innovating. You can read more at <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit">https://www.atlassian.com/company/shipit</a>. Scaled Agile, Inc., the creators of SAFe, practice what they preach and foster an innovation culture by dedicating an<a id="_idIndexMarker478"/> iteration of each PI to <strong class="bold">Innovation and Planning</strong> (<strong class="bold">IP</strong>).
