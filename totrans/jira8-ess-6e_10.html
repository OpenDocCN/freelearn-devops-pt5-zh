			<p>From <a href="B18644_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor037"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Jira for Business Projects</em>, to <a href="B18644_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor154"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Screen Management</em>, we have looked at how Jira can be used as an information system to gather data from users. In <a href="B18644_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor187"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Workflow and Business Process</em>, and <a href="B18644_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor220"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Emails and Notifications</em>, we discussed some of the features that Jira provides to add value to the gathered data through workflows and notifications. In this chapter, we will look at the other half of the equation—getting the data out and presenting it as useful information to the users.</p>
			<p>By the end of this chapter, you will have covered the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Utilizing the search interface in Jira</li>
				<li>Learning about the different search options available in Jira</li>
				<li>Getting to know about filters and how you can share search results with other users</li>
				<li>Generating reports in Jira</li>
				<li>Sharing information with dashboards and gadgets</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Specifically, this chapter will explore the following topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Search interface and options in Jira</li>
				<li>Working with search results</li>
				<li>Filters</li>
				<li>Reports</li>
				<li>Dashboards</li>
				<li>Gadgets</li>
				<li>The HR project</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-292"><a id="_idTextAnchor294"/>Search interface and options in Jira</h1>
			<p>As an information system, Jira comes loaded with features and options to search for data and present the search results to<a id="_idIndexMarker818"/> end users. Jira comes with three options to perform searches:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Quick/text search</strong>: This allows you to search for issues quickly through simple text-based search queries</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Basic/simple search</strong>: This lets you specify issue field criteria via intuitive UI controls</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Advanced search</strong>: This lets you construct powerful search queries with Jira’s own search language, <strong class="bold">Jira Query Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">JQL</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>However, before we start looking into the details of all the search options, let’s first take a look at the main search interface that you will be using in Jira while performing your searches.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-293"><a id="_idTextAnchor295"/>Issue navigator</h2>
			<p>The issue navigator is <a id="_idIndexMarker819"/>the primary interface through which you will be performing most of your searches in Jira. You can access it by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> menu in<a id="_idIndexMarker820"/> the top menu bar and then selecting the <strong class="bold">Search for issues</strong> option.</p>
			<p>The issue navigator is divided into several sections:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The first section is where <a id="_idIndexMarker821"/>you will specify all of your search criteria, such as the project you want to search and the issue type you are interested in</li>
				<li>The second section displays the results of your search</li>
				<li>The third section includes the operations that you can perform on the search results, such as exporting them into various formats</li>
				<li>The fourth and last section lists a number of preconfigured and user-created filters</li>
			</ul>
			<p>When you access the issue navigator<a id="_idIndexMarker822"/> for the first time, you will be in the <strong class="bold">Basic Search</strong> mode. The following screenshot shows the issue navigator in this mode:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.1_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.1 – Issue navigator&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.1 – Issue navigator</p>
			<p>In <strong class="bold">basic search</strong>, as you can<a id="_idIndexMarker823"/> see, you specify your search criteria with UI controls, selecting values for each field.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">If you previously visited the issue navigator and chose to use a different search option, such as <strong class="bold">advanced search</strong>, then Jira will remember this and open up <strong class="bold">advanced search</strong> instead.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-294"><a id="_idTextAnchor296"/>Quick search</h2>
			<p>This first<a id="_idIndexMarker824"/> search option we will look at is <a id="_idIndexMarker825"/>the quick search functionality, which allows you to perform quick simple searches based on the text contained in the issue’s summary, description, or comments. This allows you to perform quick text-based searches on all issues in Jira.</p>
			<p>The quick search function has several additional features to let you perform more specialized searches with minimal typing, through smart querying. Jira has a list of built-in queries, which you can use as your quick search terms to pull up issues with a specific issue type and/or status. Some <a id="_idIndexMarker826"/>useful queries are included in the following table (you can find a full quick search reference at <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver/quick-searching-939937704.html">https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver/quick-searching-939937704.html</a>):</p>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 10.1 – Smart query</p>
			<p>You can combine these<a id="_idIndexMarker827"/> queries to create quick yet powerful searches in Jira. For example, the following query brings back all the resolved issues in the <code>HD</code> is the project key:</p>
			<p><code>HD resolved</code></p>
			<p>Running a quick search is much simpler than either basic or advanced searches. All you have to do is type in either the text you want to search with or the smart query in the <strong class="bold">Quick Search</strong> box in the top-right corner, and press <em class="italic">Enter</em> on your keyboard.</p>
			<p>As you can see, the goal of a quick search is to allow you to find what you are looking for in the quickest possible way. With a smart query, you are able to perform more than just simple text-based searches.</p>
			<p>It is important to note that <a id="_idIndexMarker828"/>quick search is case-sensitive. For example, searching with <code>My</code> instead of <code>my</code> will become a simple text search rather than issues that are assigned to the currently logged-in user.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-295"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>Basic search</h2>
			<p>This is also known as <strong class="bold">simple search</strong>. The <strong class="bold">basic search</strong> interface lets you select fields you want to search with, such <a id="_idIndexMarker829"/>as issue status, and specify values for these fields. With <strong class="bold">basic search</strong>, Jira will display <a id="_idIndexMarker830"/>a list of searchable fields, and prompt you for the <a id="_idIndexMarker831"/>possible search values for the selected field. This is very handy for fields such as <strong class="bold">Status</strong>, and select list-based custom fields, as you do not have to remember all the possible options.</p>
			<p>For example, as shown in the following screenshot, we are searching for issues in the <strong class="bold">Demonstration</strong> project with a status of <strong class="bold">To Do</strong>. To help you with that, Jira will list all available statuses for you to select:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.2_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.2 – Basic search&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.2 – Basic search</p>
			<p>While working with the <strong class="bold">Basic Search</strong> interface, Jira will have the default fields of <strong class="bold">Project</strong>, <strong class="bold">Issue Type</strong>, <strong class="bold">Status</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Assignee</strong> visible. You can add fields to the search by clicking on the <strong class="bold">More</strong> drop-down option and then selecting a field you want to use in the search. Perform the following steps to <a id="_idIndexMarker832"/>construct and run a basic search:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Browse to the <strong class="bold">Issue Navigator</strong> page. If you do not see the basic search interface and the <strong class="bold">Basic</strong> link is showing, click on it to switch to <strong class="bold">basic search</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select and fill in the fields in the <strong class="bold">basic search</strong> interface. You can click on <strong class="bold">More</strong> to add more fields to the search criteria.</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Jira will automatically update the search results every time you make a change to the search criteria.</p>
			<p>When working with basic search, one thing to keep in mind is that the configurations applied to the selected project and issue type such as workflow statuses and context of the custom fields are all taken into consideration. (Please see <a href="B18644_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor119"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Field Management</em>, for field configuration.) For example, if a custom field is set to be applicable to only specific projects and/or issue types, you have to select a project and issue type as part of your search for the custom field to show up.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor298"/>Advanced search with JQL</h2>
			<p>Basic search is useful and will fulfill most of the user’s search needs. However, there are still some limitations. One such limitation is that basic search allows you to perform searches based on inclusive logic but <a id="_idIndexMarker833"/>not exclusive logic. For example, if you need to search for issues in all but one project, you will have to select every project except for the one to be excluded since the basic search interface does not let you specify exclusions.</p>
			<p>This is where advanced <a id="_idIndexMarker834"/>search comes in. With advanced search, instead of using a field selection-based interface, you will be using what is known as JQL.</p>
			<p>JQL is a custom query language developed <a id="_idIndexMarker835"/>by Atlassian. If you are familiar with the <strong class="bold">Structured Query Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">SQL</strong>) used by databases such as MySQL, you will notice that JQL has a similar syntax; however, JQL is not the same as SQL.</p>
			<p>One of the most notable differences between JQL and SQL is that JQL does not start with a <code>SELECT</code> statement. A JQL query consists of a field followed by an operator, and then by a value such as <code>assignee = john</code> or a function (which will return a value) such as <code>assignee = currentUser()</code>.</p>
			<p>You cannot specify which fields to <a id="_idIndexMarker836"/>return from a query with JQL, which is different from SQL. You can think of a JQL query as the part that comes after the <code>WHERE</code> keyword in a normal SQL <code>SELECT</code> statement. The following table<a id="_idIndexMarker837"/> summarizes the components in JQL:</p>
			<table id="table002-5" class="No-Table-Style _idGenTablePara-1">
				<colgroup>
					<col/>

			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Table 10.2 – JQL components</p>
			<p>Each JQL query is essentially made up of one or more components. A basic JQL query consists of the following three elements:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Field</strong>: This can be an issue<a id="_idIndexMarker838"/> field (for example, a status) or a custom field.</li>
				<li><code>=</code> or <code>&gt;</code>) that must be fulfilled for an issue to be returned in the result.</li>
				<li><code>Bug</code>) or a function that will return a value. If the value you are searching for contains spaces, you need to put quotes around it—for example, <code>issuetype = "New Feature"</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Queries can then be linked together to<a id="_idIndexMarker841"/> form a more complex query with keywords such as logical <code>AND</code> or <code>OR</code>. For example, a basic query to get all the issues with a status of <strong class="bold">Done</strong> will look similar to this:</p>
			<p><code>status = Done</code></p>
			<p>A more complex query to get all issues with a <code>Bug</code> issue type, and which are assigned to the currently logged-in user, will look similar to this (where <code>currentUser()</code> is a JQL function):</p>
			<p><code>issuetype = Bug and status = Resolved and assignee = currentUser()</code></p>
			<p>Discussing each and every JQL function and operator is out of the scope of the book, but you can get a full reference by clicking on the help icon in the advanced search interface. A full JQL syntax reference can be found at <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver0822/advanced-searching-1141970390.html">https://confluence.atlassian.com/jiracoreserver0822/advanced-searching-1141970390.html</a>.</p>
			<p>You can access the advanced search interface from the <strong class="bold">Issue Navigator</strong> page, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Issue Navigator</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Advanced</strong> link on the right if you are not in advanced mode already.</li>
				<li>Construct your JQL query.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> button or press the <em class="italic">Enter</em> key on your keyboard.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As JQL has a complex structure and it takes some time to get familiar with, the advanced search interface has some very <a id="_idIndexMarker842"/>useful features to help you construct your query. The interface has an autocomplete feature (which can be turned off from the <strong class="bold">General Configuration</strong> setting) that can help you pick out keywords, values, and operators to use.</p>
			<p>It also validates your query in real time and informs you whether your query is valid, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.3_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.3 – Advanced search&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.3 – Advanced search</p>
			<p>You can switch between basic and advanced search by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Basic/Advanced</strong> link while running your queries, and Jira will automatically convert your search criteria into and from JQL. In fact, this is a rather useful feature and can help you learn the basic syntax of JQL when you are first starting up, by first constructing your search in basic and then seeing what the equivalent JQL is.</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tip</p>
			<p class="callout">Switching between simple and advanced search can help you get familiar with the basics of JQL.</p>
			<p>You need to take note, however, that not all JQL can be converted into basic search since you can do a lot more with JQL than with the basic search interface. The <strong class="bold">Basic/Advanced</strong> toggle link will be disabled if the current JQL cannot be converted to the basic search interface.</p>
			<p>Now that we have seen how<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> to perform searches in Jira, we will look at different ways we can use and work with the search results, starting with the various features and operations available directly from the issue navigator.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor299"/>Working with search results</h1>
			<p>The issue navigator is capable of more than letting you run searches and presenting you with the results. It also<a id="_idIndexMarker844"/> has other features that allow you to do the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Display search results in different view options</li>
				<li>Export search results in different formats</li>
				<li>Select columns you want to see for issues in the results</li>
				<li>Share your search results with other people</li>
				<li>Create and manage filters</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will explore each of these features in the following sections.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor300"/>Switching result views</h2>
			<p>The issue navigator can display your search results in two different views. The default view is <strong class="bold">Detail View</strong>, where issues<a id="_idIndexMarker845"/> from results are listed on the left-hand side, and the currently selected issue’s details are displayed on the right. This view allows you to select and view detailed content of an issue, as well as edit the issue.</p>
			<p>The second view is <strong class="bold">List View</strong>, where issues are listed in a tabular format. The issue’s field values are displayed as table columns. As you will see later, you can configure the table columns as well as the way they are ordered. You can switch between the two views by selecting options from the <strong class="bold">Views</strong> menu next to the <strong class="bold">Basic/Advanced</strong> option.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor301"/>Customizing the column layout</h2>
			<p>If you are using the <strong class="bold">List View</strong> option to display your search results, you can configure the field columns to be displayed. In Jira, you<a id="_idIndexMarker846"/> can customize your issue navigator for all your personal searches and also on a per-search level with filters (which we will discuss later in this chapter). If you are an administrator, you can set a default column layout for all users (which can be overwritten by each user’s own column layout settings).</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to customize your global issue navigator’s column layout:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Issue Navigator</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Change your result view to <strong class="bold">List View</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Columns</strong> drop-down menu and a column layout option, as shown here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.4_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.4 – Configuring search columns&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.4 – Configuring search columns</p>
			<p>The following options can be<a id="_idIndexMarker847"/> used to lay out columns:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">My Defaults</strong>: This column layout will be applied to all your searches</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Filter</strong>: This column layout will be applied only to the current filter</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">System</strong>: This column layout will be applied to all searches</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To add or remove a field column, simply check or uncheck the field from the list. To reorder the column layout, you can drag the columns left or right to their appropriate locations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor302"/>Exporting search results</h2>
			<p>From the issue navigator, Jira allows you to export your search results to a variety of formats, such as MS Word<a id="_idIndexMarker848"/> and CSV. Jira is also able to present your search results in different formats, such as XML or print-friendly pages.</p>
			<p>When you select formats such as Word or Excel, Jira will generate the appropriate file and let you download it directly. Perform the following steps to export your results to a different format:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Issue Navigator</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Execute a search.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Export</strong> drop-down menu in the top-right corner.</li>
				<li>Select a format you wish to see your search results in, as shown:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.5_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.5 – Exporting search results&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.5 – Exporting search results</p>
			<p>Depending on the format you select, some formats will be on screen (for example, printable), while others will prompt you with a download dialog box (for example, Excel).</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor303"/>Sharing search results</h2>
			<p>After completing a search, you may want to share the results with your colleagues. Now, you can tell your colleagues to<a id="_idIndexMarker849"/> run the same search or, as we will see later in the chapter, save your search as a filter and then share it with other people. Alternatively, a more convenient way is to use the built-in share feature, especially if this is a one-off share.</p>
			<p>To share your current search results, all you have to do is click on the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> button in the top-right corner and type in the user’s name or an email address (if they are not Jira users). You can add multiple users or email addresses so that you can share this with more than one person. You can also add a quick note, letting people know why you are sharing the search results with them, and Jira will send out emails to all selected users and email addresses.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>Filters</h2>
			<p>After you have run a<a id="_idIndexMarker850"/> search query, sometimes it is useful to save the query for later use. For example, you may have created queries for several projects, listing all the open bugs and new features in each project that are to be completed by a certain date so that you can keep an eye on their progress.</p>
			<p>Instead of recreating this search query every time you want to check up on the statuses, you can save the query as a filter that can be reused at a later stage. You can think of filters as named search queries that can be reused.</p>
			<p>Other than being able to quickly pull up a report without having to recreate queries, saving search queries as filters<a id="_idIndexMarker851"/> provides you with other benefits:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Sharing saved filters with other users</li>
				<li>Using the filters as a source of data to generate reports</li>
				<li>Using the filters for agile boards (see <a href="B18644_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor058"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Jira for Agile Projects</em>)</li>
				<li>Displaying results on a dashboard as a gadget</li>
				<li>Subscribing to the search queries to have results emailed to you automatically</li>
			</ul>
			<p>A few things to keep in mind when creating and using filters as the data source for gadgets and agile boards are noted here:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>When you are creating a filter for agile boards, make sure you select relevant projects as part of your search query.</li>
				<li>When you are creating a filter for gadgets and agile boards, make sure you share the filter with the same <a id="_idIndexMarker852"/>group of users that has access to the gadgets and boards. Otherwise, they will not see any results.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We will explore all of the advanced operations you can perform with filters, and explain some of the new terms and concepts, such as dashboards and gadgets, in later sections. However, let’s look at how we can create and manage filters first.</p>
			<h3>Creating a filter</h3>
			<p>To create a new filter, you <a id="_idIndexMarker853"/>will first have to construct and execute your search query. You can do this with any of the three available search options provided in Jira, but please note that the search result must bring you to the <strong class="bold">Issue Navigator</strong> page. If you are using the quick search option and search by issue key, you will not be able to create a filter.</p>
			<p>Once you have executed your query, regardless of whether it brings back any result, you will be able to create a new filter based on the executed search, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Issue Navigator</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Construct and execute a search query in Jira.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save as</strong> button at the top.</li>
				<li>Enter a meaningful name for the filter.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Submit</strong> button to create the filter.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once you have created the filter, all your search parameters will be saved. In the future, when you rerun the saved filter, Jira will retrieve the updated results based on the same parameters.</p>
			<p>Take note that you need to click on the <strong class="bold">New filter</strong> button to start a new search if you have created a filter. Since the issue navigator remembers your last search, if you were working with an existing filter without starting a new search, you would, in fact, be modifying the current filter instead.</p>
			<h3>Managing filters</h3>
			<p>As the number of created filters grows, you will need a centralized location to manage and maintain<a id="_idIndexMarker854"/> them.</p>
			<p>You can access the <strong class="bold">Manage Filters</strong> page through the issue navigator, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Issue Navigator</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Find filters</strong> link on the left-hand side. You can also access the <strong class="bold">Manage Filters</strong> page by going through the top navigator bar.</li>
				<li>Bring up the drop-down menu from <strong class="bold">Issues</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Manage filters</strong> option at the bottom of the list.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Manage Filters</strong> page displays the filters that are visible to you in three main categories, as set out in the tabs to the left, along with an option to search for existing filters:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.6_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.6 – Manage Filters page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.6 – Manage Filters page</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Favorite</strong>: This option lists filters with a gray star next to their names. These filters will be listed in the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> drop-down menu. You can mark a filter as a favorite by clicking on the star directly.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">My</strong>: This option lists the filters that are created by you.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Popular</strong>: This option lists the top 20 filters that have the most people marking them as favorites.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Search</strong>: This option searches for existing filters that are shared by other users.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The preceding screenshot also shows that both the <strong class="bold">All PPM issues</strong> and <strong class="bold">Due this week (DEMO)</strong> filters are<a id="_idIndexMarker855"/> marked as favorites.</p>
			<h3>Sharing a filter</h3>
			<p>After creating a filter, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker856"/> update its details such as name and description, sharing permission, and search parameters. By default, newly created filters are not shared, which means they are only visible to you. To share your filters with other users, perform the following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Manage Filters</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> option for the filter you wish to share.</li>
				<li>Select a group/project role to share the filter with and click <strong class="bold">Add</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to apply the changes.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.7_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.7 – Sharing a filter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.7 – Sharing a filter</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Note</p>
			<p class="callout">Make sure you click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> link after you have chosen a group or a project to share a filter with.</p>
			<p>For you to be able to<a id="_idIndexMarker857"/> share a filter, you will also need to have the <strong class="bold">Create Shared Object</strong> global permission (please refer to <a href="B18644_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Securing Jira</em>, for more information on global permissions).</p>
			<p>When you share your filter, you can choose who will have view permission, which means being able to see and run your filter (search results are still controlled by project and issue permissions), and who will be able to make modifications to your filter. As we will see later, Jira administrators can also change the ownership of filters that are shared.</p>
			<h3>Subscribing to a filter</h3>
			<p>You have seen in <a href="B18644_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor220"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Emails and Notifications</em>, that Jira is able to send out emails when certain events occur to<a id="_idIndexMarker858"/> keep the users updated. With filters, Jira takes this feature one step further by allowing users to subscribe to a filter.</p>
			<p>When you subscribe to a filter, Jira will run a search based on the filter and send you the results in an email. You can specify a schedule of when and how often Jira should perform this. For example, you can set up a subscription to have Jira send you the results every morning before you come to work so that when you open up your mail inbox, you will have a full list of issues that require your attention.</p>
			<p>To subscribe to a filter, you will need to be able to see the filter (either created by you or shared with you by other users). Here’s how you can do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Manage Filters</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Locate the filter you wish to subscribe to.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Subscribe</strong> link for the filter.</li>
				<li>Select a recipient of the subscription. Normally, this will be you (<strong class="bold">Personal Subscription</strong>). You can also create subscriptions for other people by selecting a group.</li>
				<li>Check the <strong class="bold">Email this filter, even if there are no issues found</strong> option if you wish to have an email sent to you if there are no results returned from the filter. This can be useful to make sure that the reason you are not getting emails is not due to other errors.</li>
				<li>Specify a frequency and time when Jira can send you emails.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.8_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.8 – Subscribe filter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.8 – Subscribe filter</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Click on the <strong class="bold">Subscribe</strong> button. This will create a subscription and take you back to the <strong class="bold">Manage Filters</strong> page. The <strong class="bold">Subscribe</strong> link will increment the number of<a id="_idIndexMarker859"/> subscriptions; for example, <strong class="bold">1 Subscription</strong>.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">1 Subscription</strong> link to verify the subscription has been created correctly.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Run now</strong> link to test your new subscription. You should see something like this on your Subscription screen once you are done:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.9_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.9 – Viewing subscriptions&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.9 – Viewing subscriptions</p>
			<h3>Deleting a filter</h3>
			<p>You can delete a filter when it is no longer needed. However, since you can share your filters with other users and they can create subscriptions, you need to keep in mind that the filter might be used by an agile board or in other places, as well as the fact that you may impact other<a id="_idIndexMarker860"/> users if the filter is shared. Luckily, when you delete a filter, Jira will inform you if other people are using the filter. Here’s how you can do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Manage Filters</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> link for the filter you wish to remove. This will bring up the <strong class="bold">Delete Filter</strong> confirmation dialog box.</li>
				<li>Make sure that the removal of the filter will not impact other users.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> button to remove the filter.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Jira will inform you if the filter is being used by Jira or if there are users subscribed to it. You can click through to see a list of subscribers, and then decide to either proceed with deleting the filter and letting the other users know or leave the filter in Jira.</p>
			<h3>Changing the ownership of a filter</h3>
			<p>Usually, Jira only allows<a id="_idIndexMarker861"/> the filter’s owner to make changes to it unless the right to edit is given to other users. This is usually not a problem for private filters, but when a filter is shared with other users or used for agile boards or dashboard gadgets, this can be problematic when the owner leaves the organization.</p>
			<p>For this reason, the Jira administrator is able to change the ownership of a shared filter. Perform the following steps to change a filter’s ownership:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Shared filters</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Search for the filter you wish to change ownership of.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Change Owner</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Search for and select a user that will be the new owner.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Change Owner</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.10_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.10 – Changing filter ownership&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.10 – Changing filter ownership</p>
			<p>Filters are a very <a id="_idIndexMarker862"/>useful feature in Jira—not only can you use them to access previous searches and share them with others, as we will see in later sections, but Jira also lets you run reports and create dashboards based on your filters. Let’s have a look.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor305"/>Reports</h1>
			<p>Apart from JQL and filters, Jira also provides<a id="_idIndexMarker863"/> specialized reports to help you get a better understanding of the statistics for your projects, issues, users, and more. Most reports in Jira are designed to report on issues from a specific project; however, some reports can be used globally across multiple projects, with filters.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>Generating a report</h2>
			<p>All Jira reports are accessed from the <strong class="bold">Browse Project</strong> page of a specific project, regardless of whether the report<a id="_idIndexMarker864"/> is project-specific or global. The difference between the two types of reports is that a global report will let you choose a filter as a source of data, while a project-specific report will have its source of data predetermined based on the project you are in.</p>
			<p>When generating a report, you will often need to supply several configuration options. For example, you may have to select a filter that will provide the data for the report, or select a field to report on. The configuration options vary from report to report, but there will always be hints and suggestions to help you work out what each option is.</p>
			<p>Perform the following steps to create a report; you will first need to get to a project’s browse page:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select a project you wish to report on.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Reports</strong> option from the left panel.</li>
				<li>Select a report you wish to create. The types of reports available will vary depending on the project type.</li>
				<li>Specify configuration options for the report.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button to create the report.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Jira comes with a number of reports that are specifically designed around reporting on agile projects, such as the <strong class="bold">Burndown Chart</strong>, as well as the basic set of charts that come with Jira Core, such as <strong class="bold">Average Age Report</strong> and <strong class="bold">Pie Chart Report</strong>. The types of reports available to you depend on the type of project. Scrum and Kanban projects will have reports under the <strong class="bold">Agile</strong> category, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.11_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.11 – Reports&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.11 – Reports</p>
			<p>Let’s create a pie chart report, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">We will first <a id="_idIndexMarker865"/>select the type of report to be generated by selecting it from a list of available report types that come with Jira, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.12_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.12 – Selecting a report&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.12 – Selecting a report</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="2">We will then configure the necessary report parameters. In this case, you need to specify whether you are generating a report based on a project or an existing filter; by default, the current project will be preselected. You also need to specify which issue field you will be reporting on, as you can see from the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.13_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.13 – Configuring the report&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.13 – Configuring the report</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="3">Once you have<a id="_idIndexMarker866"/> configured the report and clicked on the <strong class="bold">Next</strong> button, Jira will generate a report and present it on the screen, as shown in the following diagram:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.14_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.14 – Generated report&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.14 – Generated report</p>
			<p>The report type<a id="_idIndexMarker867"/> determines the report’s layout. Some reports have a chart associated with them (for example, <strong class="bold">Pie Chart Report</strong>), whereas other reports will have a tabular layout (for example, <strong class="bold">Single Level Group By Report</strong>). Some reports will even have an option for you to export their content into formats such as Microsoft Excel (for example, <strong class="bold">Time Tracking Report</strong>).</p>
			<p>Reports are run on a specific project and are run on demand. Jira also lets you create dashboards that can display data across multiple projects and can be dynamically updated to always show the latest data.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor307"/>Dashboards</h1>
			<p>The dashboard is the first page you see when you access Jira. Dashboards host mini-applications known as gadgets, which<a id="_idIndexMarker868"/> provide various data and information from your Jira instance. Jira is able to present many of its features, such as filters and reports, on the dashboard using these gadgets, so it is a great way to provide users with a quick one-page view of information that is relevant or of interest to them.</p>
			<p>When designing a dashboard, you should always consider the target audience and choose the most appropriate gadgets for the job. For example, a dashboard for the management might have more charts, while a dashboard for a support team can make use of more list-style gadgets.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor308"/>Managing dashboards</h2>
			<p>When you first install Jira, the <a id="_idIndexMarker869"/>default dashboard you see is called the <strong class="bold">System Dashboard</strong>, and it is preconfigured to show some useful information, such as all issues that are assigned to you. Here’s how you can manage dashboards:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Since everyone shares the system dashboard, you as a normal user cannot make changes to it, but you can create your own dashboards. Each dashboard’s functions are configured independently.</li>
				<li>Bring down the drop-down menu from <strong class="bold">Dashboards</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Manage Dashboards</strong> option. This will bring you to the <strong class="bold">Manage Dashboards</strong> page, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.15_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.15 – Manage Dashboards page&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.15 – Manage Dashboards page</p>
			<p>From this page, you can edit and maintain dashboards created by you, search dashboards created and<a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> shared by others, and mark them as favorites so that they will be listed as tabs for easy access.</p>
			<p>When a dashboard is marked as a favorite by clicking on the star icon in front of its name, the dashboard will be accessible when you click on the <strong class="bold">Dashboards</strong> link on the top menu bar. If you have more than one favorite dashboard, each will be listed in the tab and you can select which one to display.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-307"><a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>Creating a dashboard</h2>
			<p>The default <strong class="bold">System Dashboard</strong> cannot be changed by normal users, so if you want to have a personalized dashboard <a id="_idIndexMarker871"/>displaying information that is specific to you, you will need to create a new dashboard. Perform the following steps to create a new dashboard:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Manage Dashboards</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create new dashboard</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Enter a meaningful name and description for the new dashboard.</li>
				<li>Select whether you wish to copy from an existing dashboard or start with a blank one. This is similar to creating a new screen from scratch or copying an existing screen.</li>
				<li>Select whether or not the new dashboard will be a favorite dashboard (for easy access) by clicking on the star icon.</li>
				<li>Select whether you wish to share the dashboard with other users. If you share your dashboard with everyone by choosing the <strong class="bold">Everyone</strong> option, then users that are not logged in will also be able to see your dashboard.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to create the dashboard.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>The following screenshot shows <a id="_idIndexMarker872"/>how you can create a new dashboard from scratch (blank dashboard) and allow view access to all members of the <code>Hummingbird</code> project, and allow edit access to members of the <code>hummingbird-managers</code> group:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.16_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.16 – Creating a new dashboard&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.16 – Creating a new dashboard</p>
			<p>For you to be able to share a dashboard, you will also need to have the <strong class="bold">Create Shared Object</strong> global permission (please refer to <a href="B18644_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Securing Jira</em>, for more information on global permissions).</p>
			<p>Once you have created the new dashboard, you will be taken immediately to it. As the owner of the new dashboard, you will be able to edit its layout and add gadgets to it. We will be looking at these configuration options in the next section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-308"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Configuring a dashboard</h2>
			<p>All custom-created dashboards <a id="_idIndexMarker873"/>can be configured once they have been created. As the owner, there are two aspects of a dashboard you can configure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Layout</strong>: This describes how the dashboard page will be divided</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Contents</strong>: This describes the gadgets that are to be added to the dashboard</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Setting a layout for the dashboard</h3>
			<p>You have to be the owner<a id="_idIndexMarker874"/> of the dashboard (created by you) to set the layout. Setting a dashboard’s layout is quite simple and straightforward. If you are the owner, you will have the <strong class="bold">Edit Layout</strong> option in the top-right corner while you view the dashboard.</p>
			<p>Jira comes with five layouts that you can choose from. These layouts differ in how the dashboard page’s onscreen real estate is divided. By default, a new dashboard has a second layout that divides it into two columns of equal size. Perform the following steps to set a layout for a dashboard:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Bring up the drop-down menu from <strong class="bold">Dashboards</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select a dashboard you wish to edit the layout for.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit Layout</strong> option in the top-right corner. This will bring up the <strong class="bold">Edit layout</strong> dialog.</li>
				<li>Select a layout to which you wish to change, as follows:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.17_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.17 – Selecting a dashboard layout&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.17 – Selecting a dashboard layout</p>
			<p>A layout selected from the dialog box will be immediately applied to the dashboard. Any existing contents will <a id="_idIndexMarker875"/>automatically have their size and positions adjusted to fit the new layout. After you have decided on your dashboard’s layout, you can start adding<a id="_idIndexMarker876"/> contents, known as <strong class="bold">gadgets</strong>, onto your dashboard. We will cover gadgets later in this chapter.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-309"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>Changing the ownership of a dashboard</h2>
			<p>As with filters, the <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>Jira administrator can change the ownership of a dashboard to a different user, in case the original user has left the organization. Perform the following steps to change a dashboard’s ownership:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">System</strong> tab and then the <strong class="bold">Shared dashboards</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Search for a dashboard you wish to change ownership of.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Change Owner</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Search for and select a user that will be the new owner.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Change owner</strong> button, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.18_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.18 – Changing dashboard ownership&#13;&#10;"/>

			<h1 id="_idParaDest-310"><a id="_idTextAnchor312"/>Gadgets</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Gadgets</strong> are like mini-applications that live on a dashboard in Jira. They are similar to widgets in most of the smartphones<a id="_idIndexMarker878"/> we have today or portlets in most portal applications. Each gadget has its own unique interface and behavior. For example, the <strong class="bold">Pie Chart</strong> gadget displays data in a pie chart, while the <strong class="bold">Assigned to Me</strong> gadget lists all the unresolved issues that are assigned to the current user in a table. Gadgets are another way for you to use search filters, by visually presenting the results to end users. Jira comes with many useful gadgets out of the box, and you can add more gadgets to Jira from third-party apps. We will cover how to install and manage third-party apps in <a href="B18644_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor346"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>.</p>
			<p>Let’s start by looking at how to add a gadget to your dashboard.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-311"><a id="_idTextAnchor313"/>Placing a gadget on the dashboard</h2>
			<p>All gadgets<a id="_idIndexMarker879"/> are listed in the <strong class="bold">gadget directory</strong>. Jira comes with a number of useful <a id="_idIndexMarker880"/>gadgets, such as the <strong class="bold">Assigned to Me</strong> gadget that you see on the <strong class="bold">System Dashboard</strong>. The following screenshot shows the gadget directory, listing all bundled gadgets in Jira:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.19_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.19 – Gadget directory&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.19 – Gadget directory</p>
			<p>Perform the following <a id="_idIndexMarker881"/>steps to place a gadget onto your dashboard:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Bring up the <a id="_idIndexMarker882"/>drop-down menu from <strong class="bold">Dashboards</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select a dashboard you wish to add a gadget to.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Gadget</strong> option in the top-right corner. This will bring up the <strong class="bold">Gadget Directory</strong> window.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Load all gadgets</strong> link to make all gadgets appear. You only need to do this for the first time when you load the gadget directory.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add gadget</strong> button for the gadget you wish to add.</li>
				<li>Close the dialog to return to the dashboard.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Depending on the gadget you selected, some gadgets will require additional options to be configured. For these gadgets, you will be presented with their configuration screen on the dashboard. Fill in the options and click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button.</p>
			<p>Let’s look at the following screenshot of the configuration screen for the <strong class="bold">Filter Results</strong> gadget:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.20_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.20 – Configuring a gadget&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.20 – Configuring a gadget</p>
			<p>On the configuration <a id="_idIndexMarker883"/>screen, you can select a search filter to display and control the number of results to show and the fields to include. One common <a id="_idIndexMarker884"/>parameter is the <strong class="bold">Auto refresh</strong> option, where you can decide how often the gadget can refresh its content or stay static if you leave it unchecked. Whenever you refresh the entire dashboard, all gadgets will load the latest data, but if you stay on the dashboard for an extended period of time, each gadget can automatically refresh its data, so the content will not become stale over time.</p>
			<p>When you add a gadget, it’s usually added to the first available spot on the dashboard. This sometimes might not be where you want to display the gadget on the dashboard, and in other cases, you might want to move the existing gadgets around from time to time. As the owner of the dashboard, you can easily move gadgets on a dashboard by dragging and dropping them to the desired location.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-312"><a id="_idTextAnchor314"/>Editing a gadget</h2>
			<p>After configuring your <a id="_idIndexMarker885"/>gadget when you first place it on your dashboard, the gadget will remember this and use it to render its content. You can update the configuration details or even its look and feel, as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the dashboard that has gadgets you wish to update.</li>
				<li>Hover over a gadget and click on the down arrow button in the top-right corner of it. This will bring up the gadget configuration menu.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> option.</li>
				<li>This will change the gadget into its configuration mode.</li>
				<li>Update the configuration options.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button to apply the changes. You can see an example of what this might look like here:</li>
			</ol>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_10.21_B18644.jpg" alt="Figure 10.21 – Editing a gadget&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 10.21 – Editing a gadget</p>
			<p>The preceding screenshot shows the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> menu for the <strong class="bold">Assigned to Me</strong> gadget. Some gadgets will have a <strong class="bold">Refresh</strong> option. Since gadgets retrieve their data asynchronously through AJAX, you can use this<a id="_idIndexMarker886"/> option to refresh the gadget itself without refreshing the entire page. The <strong class="bold">Edit</strong>, <strong class="bold">Delete</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Color</strong> options are only available to the owner of the dashboard.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-313"><a id="_idTextAnchor315"/>Deleting a gadget</h2>
			<p>As the owner of the <a id="_idIndexMarker887"/>dashboard, you can remove existing gadgets from the dashboard when they are no longer needed. When you remove a gadget from a dashboard, please note that all the other users who have access to your dashboard will no longer see it. Perform the following steps to delete a gadget:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to a dashboard that has gadgets you wish to delete.</li>
				<li>Hover over the gadget and click on the down arrow button in the top-right-hand corner of it. This will bring up the gadget configuration menu.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Delete</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Confirm the removal when prompted.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Once removed, the gadget will disappear from the dashboard. If you choose to re-add the same gadget at a later stage, you will have to reconfigure it again.</p>
			<p>This covers searches, reports, and dashboards in Jira. In the next section, we will build a custom dashboard for our HR project.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-314"><a id="_idTextAnchor316"/>The HR project</h1>
			<p>In our previous chapters and exercises, we built and customized a Jira project to collect data from users. What we need to do now is process and present this data back to the users. The goal we are trying to achieve<a id="_idIndexMarker888"/> in this exercise is to set up a dashboard for our HR team that will have useful information such as statistics and issue listings, which can help our team members to better organize themselves to provide better services to other departments.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-315"><a id="_idTextAnchor317"/>Setting up filters</h2>
			<p>The first step is to<a id="_idIndexMarker889"/> create a useful filter that can be shared with the other members of the team and that also acts as a source of data to feed our gadgets. We will use the advanced search to construct our search. Proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Issue Navigator</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Advanced</strong> link to switch to advanced search with JQL.</li>
				<li>Type <code>project = HR and issuetype in ("New Employee", Termination) and resolution is empty order by priority code</code> in the JQL search query.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> button to execute the search.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save as</strong> button to bring up the <strong class="bold">Save Filter</strong> dialog.</li>
				<li>Name the filter <strong class="bold">Unresolved HR Tasks</strong> and click on the <strong class="bold">Submit</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Share the filter with the <code>hr-team</code> group set up in <a href="B18644_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor256"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Securing Jira</em>, by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> link next to the <strong class="bold">Save as</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This filter searches for and returns a list of unresolved issues of the New Employee and Termination type from our HR project. The search results are then ordered by their priority so that the users can determine the urgency. As you will see in the later steps, this filter will be used as the source of data for your gadgets to present information on your dashboard.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-316"><a id="_idTextAnchor318"/>Setting up dashboards</h2>
			<p>The next step is to create a<a id="_idIndexMarker890"/> new dashboard for your helpdesk team. What you need is a dashboard specifically for your team so that you can share information easily. For example, you can have a dashboard displayed on a large overhead projector showing all high-priority incidents that need to be addressed. Perform the following steps to do this:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <strong class="bold">Manage Dashboards</strong> page.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Create new dashboard</strong> button.</li>
				<li>Name the new dashboard <strong class="bold">Human Resources</strong>.</li>
				<li>Select a blank dashboard as your base.</li>
				<li>Check the new dashboard as a favorite.</li>
				<li>Share the dashboard with the <code>hr-team</code> group.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add</strong> button to create the dashboard.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>In our example, we will use<a id="_idIndexMarker891"/> the two default column layouts for your new dashboard. Alternatively, you are free to experiment with other layouts and find ones that best suit your needs.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-317"><a id="_idTextAnchor319"/>Setting up gadgets</h2>
			<p>Now that you have set up <a id="_idIndexMarker892"/>your portal dashboard page and shared it with the other members of the team, you need to start adding some useful information to it. One example would be to have all unresolved incidents that are waiting to be processed on the dashboard display. Jira has an <strong class="bold">Assigned to Me</strong> gadget that shows all issues that are assigned to the currently logged-in user, but what you need is a global list irrespective of the assignee of the incident.</p>
			<p>Luckily, Jira also has a <strong class="bold">Filter Results</strong> gadget that displays search results based on a search filter. Since you have already created a filter that returns all unresolved tasks in your HR project, the combination of both will nicely solve your problem. Proceed as follows:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Browse to the <code>Human Resources</code> dashboard you have just created.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Gadget</strong> option in the top-right corner.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Add gadget</strong> button for the <strong class="bold">Filter Results</strong> gadget.</li>
				<li>Select the <strong class="bold">Unresolved HR Tasks</strong> filter you created.</li>
				<li>Add any additional fields you wish to add for the <strong class="bold">Columns to display</strong> option.</li>
				<li>Enable <code>15</code> minutes.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>This will add a new <strong class="bold">Filter Results</strong> gadget to your new dashboard, using your filter as the source of data. The gadget will auto-refresh its contents every 15 minutes, so you will not need to refresh the page <a id="_idIndexMarker893"/>all the time. You can add some other gadgets to the dashboard to make it more informative and useful. Some other useful gadgets include the <strong class="bold">Activity Stream</strong> and <strong class="bold">Assigned to Me</strong> gadgets.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-318"><a id="_idTextAnchor320"/>Putting it together</h2>
			<p>This is pretty much all you have to do to set up and share a dashboard in Jira. After you have added a gadget to it, you will be able to see it in action. The great thing about this is that, since you have shared the dashboard with others on the team, they will be able to see the dashboard too. Members of the team will be able to search for your new dashboard or mark it as a favorite to add it to their list of dashboards.</p>
			<p>You do have to keep in mind that if you are using a filter as a source of data for your gadget, you have to share the filter with other users too; otherwise, they will not be able to see anything from the gadget.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-319"><a id="_idTextAnchor321"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we covered how users can search and report on the data they have put into Jira, which is an essential component of any information system. Jira provides a robust search facility by offering many different search options to users, including quick, simple, and advanced searches. You can save and name your searches by creating filters that can be rerun at later stages to save you from recreating the same search again.</p>
			<p>Jira also allows you to create configurable reports on projects or results brought back from search filters. Information can be shared with others through a dashboard, which acts as a portal for users to quickly have a glance at the data kept in Jira.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will look at the other application in the Jira family, Jira Service Desk, which helps to change Jira into a fully functional service desk with powerful features, such as the customer portal and SLA management.</p>
