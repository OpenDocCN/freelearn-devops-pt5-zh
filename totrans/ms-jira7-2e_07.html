Large companies have multiple teams working on different projects and using the same JIRA instance, so it is usually important to manage the permissions. Maybe there are certain projects that should be private to a certain team, or there could be third-party contractors working on a specific project and they should not have access to all the projects. JIRA is incredible tool for managing the access level and permissions of users.</p><p>It is important to understand how to manage the users and groups in JIRA. In this chapter, we will also take a look at project roles—the set of people working on an individual project.</p><p>The topics covered are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">User and group management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Working with project roles</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Types of administrator</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec51"/>User and group management</h1></div></div></div><p>JIRA is a web-based application used to track project issues that are assigned to people. The users to whom these issues will be assigned need to exist in the system. When JIRA is deployed in any organization, the first thing that should be done is gather the list of people who will be using this tool; hence, their accounts need to be created in JIRA. Each user will have their username and password unique to them; this allows them to log in to the system. JIRA has its own internal authentication mechanism as well as the ability to integrate with <strong>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol</strong> (<strong>LDAP</strong>).</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec61"/>Deciding upon the creation of user accounts</h2></div></div></div><p>In large organizations where there is no license limit or where there is a need to create users regularly, as in the case of a customer care system, JIRA can be configured in two modes—public and private. If you want to enable signup, then configure JIRA in public mode and it will display a signup link on the user login screen. However, if you have a license limit in JIRA, then it is recommended that you use JIRA in private mode, as only in that case can JIRA Administrators create an account.</p><p>Follow these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>System</strong> | <strong>General Configuration</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_001.jpg" alt="Deciding upon the creation of user accounts"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Edit Settings</strong> button in the top-right corner.</li><li class="listitem">In the next screen, you will see a setting to change the mode. Select either <strong>Private</strong> or <strong>Public</strong> based on your license limit.</li><li class="listitem">Once done click on the <strong>Update</strong> button to save your settings.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec62"/>Creating a new user</h2></div></div></div><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>User management</strong> | <strong>Users</strong> (under <strong>USER MANAGEMENT</strong>).<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_002.jpg" alt="Creating a new user"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Create user</strong> button in the top-right corner.</li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Create new user</strong> screen, enter <strong>Email address</strong>, <strong>Full name</strong>, <strong>Username</strong>, <strong>Password</strong>, check the <strong>Send notification email</strong>, check <strong>Application access</strong> as <strong>JIRA Software</strong>, and press the <strong>Create user</strong> button.<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_003.jpg" alt="Creating a new user"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">You may also check <strong>Send notification email</strong>.</li></ol></div><p>All new users are assigned to the <strong>jira-software-users</strong> group that has global permissions to access JIRA. That is, if the user is part of the <strong>jira-software-users</strong> group, then only he/she can log in to the system, and these users also count towards the license limit; of course, this can be modified by changing the <strong>Application access</strong> from <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Applications</strong> | <strong>Applications access</strong>.</p><p>JIRA has some preconfigured groups that have some extra permissions over <strong>jira-software-users</strong>. If you want to give a user JIRA admin rights then add that user to the <strong>jira-administrators</strong> group as well.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Once the user is created, click on the <strong>Manage groups</strong> button, as shown in the following screenshot, to modify the user's groups:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_004.jpg" alt="Creating a new user"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the pop-up window <strong>Manage user groups</strong>, search for <code class="literal">jira-administrators</code> group and click on the <strong>Join selected groups</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_005.jpg" alt="Creating a new user"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">The user will not have full admin rights to the JIRA instance.</li></ol></div><p>It is also possible to add more than one user to a group; let's take a look at that too later in this chapter.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec63"/>Password policy</h2></div></div></div><p>Organizations usually have a password policy for security purposes. JIRA allows you to define such a password policy:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>System</strong> | <strong>Password Policy</strong> (under <strong>SECURITY</strong>).</li><li class="listitem">The password policy is disabled by default. JIRA offers two predefined policies, <strong>Basic</strong> and <strong>Secure</strong>, but we will define our own policy. Select <strong>Custom</strong>; it will then open up a new form where you can enter the minimum length, maximum length, and how many uppercase characters, lowercase characters, digits, and special characters need to be there.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Update</strong> button to apply the new policy.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec64"/>Creating a new group</h2></div></div></div><p>Sometimes you need to perform certain actions on all the users of a certain team; for example, you want to give extra permission to all the people working on a specific project. In such cases, a group can be created. It is nothing but a collection of users. Creating a group itself doesn't do anything. How that group will behave is defined in the permission scheme.</p><p>Let's understand how we can create a new group:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>User management</strong> | <strong>Groups</strong> (under <strong>USER MANAGEMENT</strong>).</li><li class="listitem">On the right-hand side, there is an option to do an <strong>Add group</strong>. Just enter <strong>Name</strong> for the group and press the <strong>Add group</strong> button:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_006.jpg" alt="Creating a new group"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Once the group is added, it will be added in the list on the same page.</p><p>Also, it is very easy to add new users to a group:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Edit Members</strong> link under the <strong>Operations</strong> column for the group you want to modify.<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_007.jpg" alt="Creating a new group"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the next section, under <strong>Add members to selected groups(s)</strong> text box type in the usernames of the users that need to be assigned to our new group and press the <strong>Add selected users</strong> button.</li></ol></div><p>Once you have your groups created, along with the users who will be a part of it, you can then use them in project permission scheme, or project roles.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec52"/>Working with project roles</h1></div></div></div><p>Every project is executed by different people, each with their own set of responsibilities. Usually, certain aspects of the project are taken care of by these people who are part of a team. For instance, in the case of a software project, there will be a project lead who manages everything in the project and is responsible for overall progress, developers who work on the features, and then there is a team of testers to verify the built features. The first versions of JIRA had only groups, and JIRA administrators would end up creating multiple groups for various projects, such as proj-administrators, proj-developers, and so on. At the same time, the permission scheme for each project also needed to be defined for these groups. JIRA developers realized this was a problem and introduced the concept of project role that allows not only JIRA administrators but also the project administrator to add and remove users to their project roles.</p><p>In JIRA, you could have roles that are defined globally and are available in all the projects, but the people who are in such roles would be different for each project. Just adding the project role and adding users to it in the project won't have any effect until the permission schemes are modified by defining what a project role will do in the project.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec65"/>Creating a project role</h2></div></div></div><p>JIRA comes with two predefined roles, namely <strong>Administrators</strong> and <strong>Developers</strong>. You can also create new roles in JIRA. Follow these steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>System</strong> | <strong>Project roles</strong> (under <strong>SECURITY</strong>):<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_008.jpg" alt="Creating a project role"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">To add a new role, enter the <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Description</strong> of the role and press the <strong>Add Project Role </strong>button. A new role can be easily added to the system, but it is important to note here that adding a new role in JIRA won't have any effect on the project until we add users to the project role in a specific JIRA project, and define the permissions in the scheme.</li></ol></div></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec66"/>Adding users and groups in the project role</h2></div></div></div><p>Now that we have a new project role, it is time to add a few users and groups for a particular project:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to any project's <strong>Administration</strong> tab and then to <strong>Users and roles</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_009.jpg" alt="Adding users and groups in the project role"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Add users to a role</strong> link in the top right. In the popup that appears, search for the users in the <strong>Users or groups</strong> text box, select the <strong>Role</strong> from the drop-down list, and press the <strong>Add</strong> button. Do the same again if you want to add more users or groups to a specific project role. Either a user or a group can be part of your project role.<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_010.jpg" alt="Adding users and groups in the project role"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Until now, we have created a project role and also added users to it for a particular project. You can do that for all the projects. These project roles are available for use in all the projects in our instance, but now we need to define the permission this role has in our project.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec67"/>Giving permissions to your project role</h2></div></div></div><p>The permissions of the <strong>Tester</strong> project role that we just added to our instance need to be configured by modifying the permission scheme for the project:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to the project tab, <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Permissions</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">On the <strong>Project Permission</strong> page, click on the <strong>Actions</strong> button in the top-right corner and select <strong>Edit permissions</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Now you can modify the permission scheme. Let's give them the permission to <strong>Manage Watchers</strong>. So, they can add a third user who is not an assignee or reporter but can still receive notifications on issue update. Click on the <strong>Edit</strong> link, as shown in this screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_011.jpg" alt="Giving permissions to your project role"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">As shown in the following screenshot, in the <strong>Grant permission</strong> popup, first select <strong>Project Role</strong>, and from the drop-down list, select the <strong>Tester</strong> project role:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_012.jpg" alt="Giving permissions to your project role"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Click on the <strong>Grant</strong> button.</li></ol></div><p>You can add more permissions like this to your new role, and, of course, all the projects using this permission scheme will be affected.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec53"/>Types of administrators</h1></div></div></div><p>JIRA administrators have the ability to make changes to the system configuration and schemes, and to manage users. The administrative user is created when JIRA is installed. In big organizations where there is a team of people taking care of JIRA, there could be multiple JIRA administrators. There is a group called <strong>jira-adminstators</strong> in JIRA. The administrative user that is created during installation is part of this group, and more users can be added to it later on.</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>System</strong> | <strong>Global Permissions</strong> (under <strong>SECURITY</strong>):<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_07_013.jpg" alt="Types of administrators"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>If you notice, from the administrative point of view, JIRA offers two different permissions called <strong>JIRA System Administrators</strong> and <strong>JIRA Administrators</strong>.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec68"/>JIRA System Administrators</h2></div></div></div><p>Users who are part of this global permission can perform all the administrative functions. They can make changes in the configuration and scheme, perform system restore, and modify mail configurations as well.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl2sec69"/>JIRA Administrator</h2></div></div></div><p>Even if your organization has multiple JIRA administrators, there are certain features that need to be restricted. A <strong>JIRA Administrators</strong> permission allows users to perform most of the administrative functions, except system restore, importing and exporting, and changes to the mail configurations, as these features could potentially lead to system breakdown and may result in loss of data as well. So, it is advisable to only give the <strong>JIRA System Administrators</strong> permission to one or two people in the organization, and the rest could have the <strong>JIRA Administrators</strong> permission.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch07lvl1sec54"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, you learned how to manage users and groups. To give access to new users and assign them to the right group is one of the most important activities of a JIRA administrator. The responsibility of adding new users to the system and assigning them to the right group is crucial for data integrity, and it should be in tune with your company's policies. You also learned how to create project roles and define their permissions.</p><p>In the next chapter, you will learn how you can integrate JIRA with LDAP, Crowd, and JIRA user server. This way, users don't need to remember multiple logins for different tools, and it is also much easier for the administrators to manage users efficiently from a single place.</p></div></body></html>
