    Navigation*, explores the Site Map Designer, which is a new web-based tool, introduced
    in Dynamics 365 CRM, which lets the customizer quickly define navigation within
    an app. Previously, one had to export the Sitemap XML and update it manually in
    the XML editor, or had to use some third-party tools. The built-in Site Map Designer
    makes editing the site map for an application much easier*.*'
