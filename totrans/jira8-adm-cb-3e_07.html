                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrations with Jira</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Organizations are adopting more and more IT applications, both on-premises and through cloud-based applications, in order to support their various business functions. As today's world is becoming more and more interconnected, these applications need to be similarly interlinked. Business functions often need to work together in order to achieve the desired outcome more efficiently. For this reason, the ability to integrate Jira with other applications has become ever more important.</p>
<p>You can integrate applications with Jira in many ways, both when reaching out to obtain data from other systems and when allowing other systems to access Jira's own data. Jira comes with support to integrate with other Atlassian applications and a number of other popular cloud applications, such as GitHub. Other than the integration supported out of the box, there are also many third-party apps that provide integration with applications and platforms such as Google Drive, Slack, and more. Lastly, there is <strong>webhook</strong>, a relatively new approach that allows any other application to register with Jira for callbacks when certain events occur.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following recipes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrating Jira with Confluence</li>
<li>Integrating Jira with other Jira instances</li>
<li>Integrating Jira with Bamboo for build management</li>
<li>Integrating Jira with Bitbucket Server</li>
<li>Integrating Jira with Bitbucket Cloud and GitHub</li>
<li>Integrating Jira with Slack</li>
<li>Integrating Jira with Google Drive</li>
<li>Using Jira webhooks</li>
<li>Using the Jira REST API</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrating Jira with Confluence</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You will often use Jira to track the progress of your engineering projects, using another application to keep the documentation for these projects. In this recipe, we will look at how to integrate Jira with Confluence, which is another popular application from Atlassian that is commonly used for documentation.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since we will be using Confluence in this recipe, you will need to have an instance of Confluence running on your system. If you do not have one, you can download a free Confluence trial from <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence" target="_blank">https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first step is to establish the link between Jira and Confluence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Applications &gt; Application links in Jira.</li>
<li>Enter your Confluence URL into the Application textbox and click the <strong>Create new link</strong> button. Jira should automatically detect the target application as Confluence. If, for some reason, it does not, make sure you select Confluence as the Application type when prompted, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/2b8da0fc-ef2d-45ef-a444-9356eb6844ab.png" style="width:22.92em;height:24.67em;"/></div>
<p>We also need to enable the Remote access API (disabled by default) in Confluence:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to Confluence as a Confluence administrator.</li>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Further Configuration.</li>
<li>Click on Edit, scroll down, and check the Remote API (XML-RPC &amp; SOAP) option.</li>
<li>Click on Save to apply the change:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/882b5df3-8ecd-4750-af84-83c2149781dd.png"/></p>
<p class="mce-root">The remote access API is now enabled.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once we have linked Jira with Confluence, there will be a new option called Confluence Page, which appears when you select the Link option in the More issue menu, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/861d8387-0554-46c2-8e13-cb0a12ed062c.png"/></div>
<p>If you know the exact URL of the Confluence page, you can enter it in the Page URL field, or click on the search for a page link and search for the page you want to link to:</p>
<div><img src="img/04dbc3de-6d49-472c-96d2-7cd886e42d48.png" style="width:41.83em;height:17.33em;"/></div>
<p>Once you have found the page you want, simply click on it, and then click on the Link button. You will see a page similar to the one shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/2fdd06bd-843c-4a56-94af-808f77e7f3d7.png" style="width:46.33em;height:29.58em;"/></div>
<p class="CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">As you can see, the linked pages will be shown under the Issue Links section in the Wiki Page category.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrating Jira with other Jira instances</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If you have multiple Jira instances in your organization, it is sometimes useful to integrate them with each other, especially when teams from different projects need to collaborate and work together. In this recipe, we will integrate two Jira instances with each other so that we can link issues across systems.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Go through the following steps to link two Jira instances together:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Applications &gt; Application links.</li>
<li>Enter the other Jira instance's URL and create the application link. Jira should automatically detect the target application as Jira, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7f7e20b2-be26-4f21-ae19-e95f24db00a7.png" style="width:21.92em;height:8.75em;"/></p>
<p>If, for some reason, Jira does not detect this, make sure you select Jira as the Application type when prompted</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once you have integrated two Jira instances with each other using an application link, you will be able to search for and link issues from the remote Jira instance to issues in the local Jira instance. Look at the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/e87e8dd4-90eb-40fc-bba9-54b13f569019.png" style="width:40.58em;height:29.17em;"/></div>
<p>As you can see, when you use the link feature, Jira will prompt you to select the Jira instance that you want to search for issues to link with.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrating Jira with Bamboo for build management</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Bamboo is the continuous integration and build server from Atlassian. If your development team is using Jira, then it makes perfect sense to also use Bamboo and integrate the two together.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since we will be using Bamboo in this recipe, you will need to have a Bamboo instance running. If you do not have one, you can download a free Bamboo trial from <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo" target="_blank">https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since we are connecting to another Atlassian application here, we should take advantage of the application links:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Applications &gt; Application links.</li>
<li>Enter your Bamboo URL and create the application link. Jira should automatically detect the target application as Bamboo, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ce83b312-b509-4ace-a7d7-1bd2f604bddd.png" style="width:19.83em;height:8.42em;"/></p>
<p>If, for some reason, Jira does not detect this, make sure you select Bamboo as the Application type when prompted.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once you have integrated Jira and Bamboo, you will be able to run and release build plans directly from Jira. All you have to do is select the version to release and select the new Build and Release option, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/a63c406d-48ab-481f-b711-e4e4ac781836.png" style="width:48.42em;height:21.75em;"/></div>
<p>From the release dialog shown in the following screenshot, you can select which build plan to use and run the build by clicking on the Release button. If the build is successful, Jira will automatically mark the version as released once the build is completed:</p>
<div><img src="img/4580b371-2ed9-4558-9efd-703eef3c9e4d.png" style="width:36.58em;height:24.83em;"/></div>
<p>Another feature that you get from integration is that you will be able to see a list of builds that are related to a given Jira issue from the Development issue panel:</p>
<div><img src="img/3cd23ba7-bc0f-438a-991f-d5f3078921ed.png" style="width:44.17em;height:17.08em;"/></div>
<p>As you can see, all the build are now listed.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Apart from Bamboo, Jira also supports other build server systems, such as Jenkins and Hudson, via third-party apps. You can get the app for Jenkins and Hudson from <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.marvelution.jira.plugins.jenkins" target="_blank">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.marvelution.jira.plugins.jenkins</a>.</p>
<p>After you have installed the app, there will be two new application types to choose from while creating new application links—namely, Jenkins and Hudson.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrating Jira with Bitbucket Server</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Bitbucket is the on-premises enterprise Git source code management tool. It is another application from Atlassian that provides you with all the great <strong>distributed version control system</strong> (<strong>DVCS</strong>) features and benefits. If you are using Jira for software development projects, then you should consider Bitbucket for your version control needs.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>In this recipe, we will integrate Jira with Bitbucket Server so that developers can see what changes are made to a given issue.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since we will be using Bitbucket Server in this recipe, you need to have a Bitbucket Server instance running on your system. If you do not have one, you can download a free Bitbucket Server trial from <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket">https://www.atlassian.com/software/bitbucket</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Go through the following steps to integrate Jira with Bitbucket Server:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Applications &gt; Application links.</li>
<li>Enter your Bitbucket Server URL and create the application link. Jira should automatically detect the target application as Bitbucket, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/8580b8f4-7559-408e-a886-3bc580b7f25d.png" style="width:20.83em;height:8.83em;"/></p>
<p>If, for some reason, Jira does not detect it, make sure you select Bitbucket Server as the Application type when prompted</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira and Bitbucket Server integration work by looking through your <em>commit logs</em> for comments that start with or contain any issue keys. See the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/59b5c9da-63b9-44e4-99df-b21a05c83d15.png"/></div>
<p>If the commit comment contains an issue key, the commits will be displayed in the Development issue panel of the issue.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There is more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If you are using Bitbucket Cloud instead of running it on-premises, refer to the next recipe for information on how to integrate with it.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrating Jira with Bitbucket Cloud and GitHub</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Bitbucket Cloud is Atlassian's cloud-based code repository service. It provides public and private code repositories, with support for both Git and Mercurial. It is a great option for organizations that want to move to DVCS, but do not want to deal with the infrastructure overhead.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will look at how to integrate our on-premises-hosted Jira with Bitbucket in the cloud.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since we will be using Bitbucket Cloud in this recipe, you need to have a Bitbucket account (both Git and Mercurial repositories will work). If you do not have one, you can sign up for a free account at <a href="https://bitbucket.org/" target="_blank">https://bitbucket.org</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The first step is to create a new consumer in Bitbucket Cloud for Jira, which will generate the consumer key and secret:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your Bitbucket account.</li>
<li>Navigate to Bitbucket settings &gt; OAuth.</li>
<li>Click on the Add consumer button under OAuth consumers.</li>
<li>Enter a name for the new OAuth consumer. The name you enter here will be displayed when Jira requests access authorization, so you should use a name that is easily understandable, such as <kbd>Atlassian Jira</kbd>.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>Click on Save. This will generate the consumer details we need for the next step:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/77b54d65-1712-40c5-842a-1ab26ac89353.png" style="width:47.08em;height:22.17em;"/></div>
<p>Once we have created the new consumer, the next step is to enter the consumer key and secret details into Jira, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Applications &gt; DVCS Accounts.</li>
<li>Click on the Link Bitbucket Cloud or GitHub account button.</li>
<li>Select Bitbucket Cloud<strong> </strong>as the Host option.</li>
<li>Enter the Bitbucket account name, the OAuth Key, and the OAuth Secret details that are generated from the consumer we just created:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/5cc47377-ad99-4a6b-be8d-98b07a2f5fb0.png" style="width:32.58em;height:20.58em;"/></p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Click on Add to link Jira to Bitbucket Cloud.</li>
</ol>
<p>Once Jira has established a connection to Bitbucket Cloud, you will be prompted to grant Jira access to your Bitbucket Cloud account. Make sure the consumer name (in bold) is the same as the consumer we created, and then click on Grant access:</p>
<div><img src="img/64dae8a5-40b5-4633-a28a-dc596c8b8cf9.png" style="width:29.25em;height:24.92em;"/></div>
<p>Let's understand how these steps work.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira uses OAuth as the authorization mechanism to retrieve data from Bitbucket. With OAuth, the application that retrieves data is called the <strong>consumer</strong>, and the application that provides data is called the <strong>provider</strong>.</p>
<p>Each consumer needs to be registered with the provider, that generates a key or secret pair. We performed the registration in our first step by adding a new consumer in Bitbucket:</p>
<div><img src="img/dae65f87-a326-4026-938f-93191a8fd575.png" style="width:44.33em;height:19.00em;"/></div>
<p>If you do not see the Development issue panel, make sure you have the View Development Tools project permission.</p>
<p>By default, members of the Developers project role have the View Development Tools permission.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>As you might have already seen during the setup process, Jira also supports GitHub, both the standard cloud version and the enterprise on-premises version. To integrate with GitHub, you follow the same steps; however, while setting up DVCS accounts, you need to select GitHub instead of Bitbucket.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>With GitHub, you will also need the consumer key and secret that is generated when you register a new application in GitHub. You can register the application as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to your GitHub account.</li>
<li>Navigate to Account settings<strong> </strong>&gt; <strong>Developer settings</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the OAuth Apps<strong> </strong>tab:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/88e1f0e9-e832-4361-81a2-25674312fe26.png" style="width:41.00em;height:10.08em;"/></p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Click on New OAuth App<strong> </strong>and enter a name.</li>
<li>Enter Jira's URL for both the Homepage URL<strong> </strong>and Authorization callback URL.</li>
<li>Click on Register application.</li>
</ol>
<p>After you have registered the application, a new client key and secret pair will be generated for Jira to use. You then just need to go to Jira's DVCS account section and select GitHub as the host when linking a new DVCS account to Jira.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrating Jira with Slack</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Slack is the world's most popular cloud-based collaboration tool. It provides features such as persistent chat rooms, file sharing, direct messaging, and much more, with support for web, desktop, and mobile. Atlassian has formed a strategic partnership with Slack, committing to better integration between the two companies' products and services.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will integrate Jira with Slack so that every time an issue is created or updated in Jira, a notification will be sent to the corresponding Slack channel.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Since we will be using Slack in this recipe, you will need to have a Slack account. If you do not have one, you can sign up for a free account at <a href="https://slack.com">https://slack.com</a>.</p>
<p>The integration requires the <strong>Jira Server for Slack (Official) </strong>app, which is the official app from Atlassian. You can get the app from <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220099/jira-server-for-slack-official">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1220099/jira-server-for-slack-official</a>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Go through the following steps to integrate Jira with Slack:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to <strong>Administration </strong>&gt; <strong>Applications</strong> &gt; <strong>Slack</strong>.</li>
<li>Click on the Connect Slack team<strong> </strong>button.</li>
<li>Choose the recommended <strong>Basic</strong> option and click on the Go to Slack button, which will take you to Slack:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/e5f48346-f5b3-4767-99bc-9ff57784eaad.png" style="width:41.58em;height:23.92em;"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Log in to Slack (if you are not logged in already) and install the Jira Server Slack app.</li>
<li>Authorize access when prompted:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/b54b76c6-d705-4d6d-8a4a-1d1840607da9.png" style="width:26.50em;height:31.00em;"/></p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Go back to Jira and check that the credentials textbox is automatically filled in with your Slack's details.</li>
<li>Click on the Save button and the integration will be established between Jira and Slack.</li>
</ol>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Once you have completed the integration setup, you can connect your Jira projects with Slack channels, as shown in the following screenshot, where we have enabled notifications to be sent to the <kbd>#hummingbird</kbd> channel regarding all activities on issues in the <kbd>Project Hummingbirds</kbd> project:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/a856c5ab-04c8-40af-9878-4e0f4bcdc27c.png"/></p>
<p>After you have linked your Jira project to a Slack channel, changes to issues will appear in Slack. The integration also includes a number of commands you can run in Slack; simply type in <kbd>/jira</kbd> and Slack will prompt you with a list of options:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/0fbb29f9-c862-4fa2-87a1-9e5a983fe67b.png" style="width:53.00em;height:24.58em;"/></p>
<p>Other than the official Slack integration app from Atlassian, there are also other third-party apps on the Atlassian Marketplace with different features you can try. This is one of the strengths of Jira: there are always other options if the default does not fit your needs, and if all else fails, you also have the option to create your own.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrating Jira with Google Drive</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>It is common for organizations today to use some kind of document-management system—either on-premises or in the cloud—such as Google Drive, Box, and Dropbox.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will integrate Jira with Google Drive so that users will be able to search, link, preview, and download files stored in Google Drive from Jira.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Getting ready</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>For this recipe, we need to have Google Drive installed in the Atlassian Jira app. You can download it from <a href="http://www.appfusions.com/display/GDOCSJ/Home" target="_blank">http://www.appfusions.com/display/GDOCSJ/Home </a>and install it with the UPM.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Go through the following steps to set up an integration between Jira and Google Drive:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://console.developers.google.com/project" target="_blank">https://console.developers.google.com/project</a> and follow the instructions from <a href="https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2">https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2</a> to create a new OAuth client.</li>
<li>Copy the Google OAuth client ID and secret from the generated OAuth client.</li>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; Manage apps &gt; Google Configuration.</li>
<li>Enter the Google OAuth client ID and secret into the Client ID and Client Secret fields, respectively.</li>
<li>Click the Save button to complete the set up.</li>
</ol>
<p>The following table shows the fields on the Google Configuration page:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Field</strong></td>
<td><strong>Description</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client ID</td>
<td>The Google OAuth2 client ID</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Client secret</td>
<td>The Google OAuth2 client secret</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>The Google Configuration page is displayed in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/c403dde5-3ed8-4484-8a20-56dd806835d3.png" style="width:40.33em;height:38.25em;"/></div>
<p class="packt_figure CDPAlignLeft CDPAlign">Let's see how these steps work.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The integration of Google Drive with Jira uses OAuth, where each user needs to first authorize Jira to access Google Drive on their behalf. This process is called the <strong>OAuth dance</strong>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Once the app is installed and configured, there will be a new Link Google Document field under the More menu that can be seen while viewing issues. Clicking on that option will present you with a dialog to either browse or search for files stored in Google Drive. You can then select the files you want to link with by checking the appropriate checkboxes:</p>
<div><img src="img/c7736cd7-d98b-4e42-adbf-5bdb6e7f7772.png" style="width:37.08em;height:35.92em;"/></div>
<p>After you have selected and linked the files you want, the selected files will be listed under the Issue Links section:</p>
<div><img src="img/04f01162-3ea9-47e9-9312-4c41cc1554a4.png" style="width:46.58em;height:32.50em;"/></div>
<p>Depending on the file type, you will be able to view, edit, and download the native Google Drive files if you have the required permissions from Google Drive.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There are many other third-party integration apps available that support popular cloud vendors, including the following:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Jira webhooks</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In previous recipes, we looked at how to integrate Jira with specific applications and platforms. In this recipe, we will look at webhooks, which is a different way of implementing integration with Jira.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Go through the following steps to set up a webhook:</p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to Administration &gt; System &gt; Webhooks.</li>
<li>Click on the Create a webhook<strong> </strong>button.</li>
<li>Enter a name for the new webhook. This should clearly explain the purpose of the webhook and/or the target system—for example, <kbd>WebHook for Slack #support channel</kbd>.</li>
<li>Enter the URL of the target system for the webhook to call. The URL should be provided by the target system.</li>
<li>Check the Exclude details checkbox if adding data to <kbd>POST</kbd> will cause errors.</li>
<li>Enter the JQL to define the issues that will trigger the webhook or leave it blank for all issues. It is recommended that you use JQL to restrict the scope.</li>
<li>Select the issue events that will trigger the webhook.</li>
<li>Click on Create<strong> </strong>to register the webhook:</li>
</ol>
<div><img src="img/c6ff6442-910f-4eec-8326-e36161508dde.png" style="width:46.42em;height:37.33em;"/></div>
<p>This completes the steps for this recipe.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Webhooks use an event-based mechanism, where the source system (in this case, Jira) will make an HTTP <kbd>POST</kbd> call to all the registered webhooks when a registered event occurs. This is very similar to Jira's internal notification system where emails are sent based on events.</p>
<p>With the event-based approach, instead of requiring the remote application to constantly poll Jira for changes, which is both inefficient and inadequate for situations where changes need to be processed in real time, the remote application can be registered in Jira with a webhook, and Jira will call the application when the event occurs.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>You can also trigger webhooks from the workflow <kbd>POST</kbd> function with the <kbd>Trigger a Webhook</kbd> <kbd>POST</kbd> function. All you have to do is select the transition that will be the trigger, add the <kbd>POST</kbd> function, and select the webhook to be triggered:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/27784f83-698b-4633-b04b-1a57e8dbc1a1.png"/></p>
<p>This is particularly useful since the webhook configuration panel only lists some of the basic event types, but not any custom event types that are used in workflows.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using the Jira REST API</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira exposes many of its features through a set of REST APIs, allowing other applications to interact with it. With these APIs, you can perform operations such as searching, creating, and deleting issues. In fact, several of the apps used throughout this book make use of these REST APIs to perform their functions.</p>
<p>Being a web-based standard, Jira's REST API allows you to use any technology with it. This means that you can write the code in Java, .NET, JavaScript, or even simple bash scripts.</p>
<p>In this recipe, we will be using the RESTClient Firefox add-on to run a search query against Jira to get a list of issues assigned to the currently logged in user. There are many other tools you can use, such as cURL and Postman for Chrome.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How to do it...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Go through the following steps to run a search query using Jira's REST API:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open up RESTClient in the Firefox browser.</li>
<li>Set the <strong>Method </strong>to GET.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Enter <kbd>http://localhost:8080/rest/api/2/search?jql=assignee=currentUser()</kbd> into the URL textbox. Make sure that you change the URL to your Jira instance.</li>
<li>Select Basic authentication and enter your username and password.</li>
<li>Click on the SEND button.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should see the result of the API call under the Response section. Select the Preview tab to see the result as formatted JSON, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img src="img/266dc5ce-34bc-438e-8762-1d2d01704f60.png" style="width:42.08em;height:29.00em;"/></div>
<p>The result of the API call is now visible.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">How it works...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira's REST APIs always follow the URI structure of <kbd>http://host:port/context/rest/api-name/api-version/resource-name</kbd>. So, in our example, we are using version 2 of the search API. The <kbd>jql</kbd> parameter contains the actual JQL query we are running. Most APIs will require you to be logged in, so we configure the settings to use basic authentication as part of our API call.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">There's more...</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There is an app called <strong>Atlassian REST API Browser</strong> (<strong>RAB</strong>) that you can install in Jira that allows you to interact with your Jira's REST APIs directly in a browser. You can get this app from <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.labs.rest-api-browser/server/overview" target="_blank">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.labs.rest-api-browser/server/overview</a>.</p>
<p>After you have installed the app, you can open your browser and go to <kbd>http://your_jira_instance/plugins/servlet/restbrowser</kbd>. You should see an API browser interface similar to the one shown in the following screenshot. On the left-hand side, you will see a full list of the REST APIs that are available in your Jira instance (based on its version):</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/6c980d82-a1ee-4679-8a78-aeba391fb121.png"/></p>
<p>When you click on any of the APIs, the browser will present you with all the parameters and options available, so you will no longer need to manually find out what they are. This allows you to test and experiment with the APIs quickly, without having to write any code upfront or use any additional tools.</p>
