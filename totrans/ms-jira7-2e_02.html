The data is used for analysis, reporting, and taking appropriate action. The <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> window offers a very easy mechanism to search for issues, but it's possible to write queries using <strong>JIRA Query Language</strong> (<strong>JQL</strong>) to refine the search results. You will learn how to save the search results as filters and charts that can be added in the dashboard. This can be shared with other users and can also serve as a data source for various gadgets.</p><p>We will cover the following topics:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> window</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Searching the issues</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Filters and subscriptions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Introduction to JQL</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Browser shortcuts</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Exporting issues in Excel, RSS, XML, and JSON</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec18"/>The Issue Navigator window</h1></div></div></div><p>JIRA comes with a powerful feature that will let you find issues quickly and take action. For instance, you can easily search all the bugs of a particular project named <code class="literal">cristata</code> (which have been in an open state for the past 2 weeks) using the following JQL query:</p><pre class="programlisting">project = CSTA AND issuetype = Bug AND created &gt;= -2w &#13;
</pre><p>The preceding query is written in JQL (a language in JIRA to search for issues). However, if you are new to JIRA, then you can also use the <strong>Basic</strong> search feature to find issues; you don't need to learn JQL for this. Moreover, learning it is not so difficult.</p><p>You can switch from <strong>Basic</strong> search to <strong>Advanced</strong> search to deal with the preceding query. Let's first take a look at the features provided by the <strong>Basic</strong> search in the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> window.</p><p>From the top menu bar, click on <strong>Issues</strong> | <strong>Search for issues</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_001.jpg" alt="The Issue Navigator window"/></div><p>
</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec19"/>Searching the issues</h1></div></div></div><p>Now you will be taken to the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> and the default view is the <strong>Detail View</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_002.jpg" alt="Searching the issues"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the <strong>Detail View</strong> window, a lot more information about the issue is visible, such as the <strong>Details</strong>, <strong>Description</strong>, <strong>Assignee</strong>, <strong>Reporter</strong>, and <strong>Workflow</strong> buttons to transform it into another available state. You can quickly browse through the issue and view the information in the center of the screen.</p><p>The <strong>List View</strong> doesn't display too much information. The issues are displayed in the form of a table. Switch to the <strong>List View</strong> from the drop-down menu in the top-right corner, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_003.jpg" alt="Searching the issues"/></div><p>
</p><p>By default, a few issue fields are displayed in the <strong>List View</strong>, but you can always add more columns to your view.</p><p>So far, we have not refined the issues for a specific project. The default <strong>Basic</strong> search option will let you apply several conditions to refine the issues. You will find a set of buttons at the top of the issue list that will let you apply multiple conditions.</p><p>Let's refine the issues to find the <strong>cristata(CSTA)</strong> project whose issue type is <strong>Bug</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_004.jpg" alt="Searching the issues"/></div><p>
</p><p>We can further refine this list so that it contains only the issues that are in the <strong>Open</strong> state using the <strong>Status</strong> button located next to issue <strong>Type</strong>.</p><p>Now, what if we want to refine further and only view the issues opened within the last 2 weeks? There is an option to add a lot of conditions for various other issue fields. Click on the <strong>More</strong> button and select <strong>Created Date</strong>. Further, you will be asked to enter the duration in a small pop-up box, as shown in the following screenshot:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_005.jpg" alt="Searching the issues"/></div><p>
</p><p>Click on the <strong>Update</strong> button to apply this last condition as well and you will get your result.</p><p>Now, click on the last link called <strong>Advanced</strong> and you will see the resulted JQL from this operation:</p><pre class="programlisting">project = CSTA AND issuetype = Bug AND created &gt;= -2w &#13;
</pre><p>The <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> window will always generate a similar JQL when you apply various conditions using the <strong>Basic</strong> search option.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec22"/>Search using text</h2></div></div></div><p>There is a textbox at the top of the screen that will let you search for issues quickly by simply typing in simple text. However, it has some nice features that will let you find a specific issue instantly. You have to just type the issue key and you will be taken to that issue directly. You can also search all the issues that are assigned to you by typing <code class="literal">my</code>.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip13"/>Tip</h3><p>You can learn more about the various features of quick search at <a class="ulink" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Quick+Search">https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Quick+Search</a>.</p></div></div><p>You can search for a single term or a phrase using the text search. For instance, to search for an individual word such as <code class="literal">china</code>, just type it in the search box.</p><p>Wildcards are also supported for single and multiple characters:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The single character wildcard search:<p>description - <code class="literal">chin?</code>
</p><p>This will search for china, chino, and any other replacement that it will find in the description field.</p></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The multiple character wildcard search:<p>description - <code class="literal">chi*</code>
</p><p>This will search for all the words starting with <code class="literal">chi</code>. It could be China or Chinese.</p><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip14"/>Tip</h3><p>You can learn more about text searches at <a class="ulink" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Performing+Text+Searches">https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Performing+Text+Searches</a>.</p></div></div></li></ul></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec20"/>Filters and subscriptions</h1></div></div></div><p>We just saw how to search bugs that have been open within the past 2 weeks for a particular project. Now, what if we want to perform this search twice a week? Well, you can always go to the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> and apply the conditions again or write a JQL query. However, there is an amazing feature in JIRA that allows you to not only save your searches, but also receive the results in an e-mail.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Save as</strong> button at the top of the screen to save the search:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_006.jpg" alt="Filters and subscriptions"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the pop-up window, enter the <strong>Filter Name</strong> and click on the <strong>Submit</strong> button to save the query. In JIRA, these saved results are called filters.</p><p>After you save the filter, you can always click on the filter name from the left-hand side panel in the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong>.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec23"/>Subscriptions</h2></div></div></div><p>E-mail subscription is another good feature that JIRA offers which e-mails the list of the issues in a particular filter either to you or to a group of JIRA users.</p><p>Click on the <strong>Details</strong> link that is located next to the <strong>Save as</strong> button. A new pop-up window will appear. Click on <strong>New subscription</strong>:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_007.jpg" alt="Subscriptions"/></div><p>
</p><p>On the next screen, you can select the recipient as <strong>Personal Subscription</strong> or select the JIRA group name from the select list.</p><p>In <strong>Schedule</strong>, you can select <strong>Daily</strong>, <strong>Days per week</strong>, <strong>Days per month</strong>, or <strong>Advanced</strong>. The first three options are self-explanatory; however, the last option lets you write cron expressions.</p><p>As we want to get this result every 15 days or on day 15 of every month, the following cron expression will be used:</p><pre class="programlisting">0 30 9 15 * ? &#13;
</pre><p>Here are a few more examples:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

</p><div><img src="img/image_02_008.jpg" alt="Sharing your filters"/></div><p>
</p><p>On the next screen, you will get the list of all the filters that are either created by you or shared with you.</p><p>Click on <strong>Edit</strong> to modify the filter share options:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_009.jpg" alt="Sharing your filters"/></div><p>
</p><p>In the new window, you will get the option to select to share with <strong>Everyone</strong>, <strong>Project</strong>, or <strong>Group</strong>:</p><p>

</p><p>If you want to share the filter with everyone, then select it, click on the <strong>Add</strong> option, and click on <strong>Save</strong>.</p><p>Now your filter can be accessed by every other user in the system.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec21"/>Introduction to JQL</h1></div></div></div><p>JQL is one of the best features in JIRA; it lets you search the issues efficiently and offers a lot of handy features. The best part about JQL is that it's very easy to learn, thanks to the autocomplete functionality in the <strong>Advanced</strong> search that offers suggestions to the user based on the keywords typed.</p><p>JQL consists of either single or multiple questions. These questions can be combined to form complex questions.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec25"/>The basic JQL syntax</h2></div></div></div><p>JQL has a field followed by an operator. For instance, to retrieve all the issues of the <code class="literal">CSTA</code> project, you can use a simple query like this:</p><pre class="programlisting">project = CSTA &#13;
</pre><p>Now, within this project, if you want to find the issues assigned to a specific user, use the following query:</p><pre class="programlisting">project = CSTA and assignee = ravisagar &#13;
</pre><p>There might be several issues assigned to a user and maybe we just want to focus on issues whose priority is either <code class="literal">Critical</code> or <code class="literal">Blocker</code>:</p><pre class="programlisting">project = CSTA and assignee = ravisagar and priority in (Blocker,  Critical) &#13;
</pre><p>Instead of issues assigned to a specific user, what if we want to find the issues assigned to all the other users except one? This can be achieved using the following command:</p><pre class="programlisting">project = CSTA and assignee != ravisagar and priority in (Blocker,  Critical) &#13;
</pre><p>So you see that JQL consists of one or more queries.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec26"/>Use of operators in JQL</h2></div></div></div><p>Operators are symbols that compare the field from the left-hand side to a value on the right-hand side. Here is a list of all the supported operators in JQL:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

</pre></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec27"/>Advanced search using functions</h2></div></div></div><p>There are times when the value in the query needs to be dynamic. For instance, if you want to write a query to list all the issues created in the last 2 days, then use the following query:</p><pre class="programlisting">created &gt; startOfDay("-2d") &#13;
</pre><p>The <code class="literal">startOfDay()</code> function is the function whose value is calculated at the time this query is run.</p><p>We can further refine this query to list all the issues created in the last 2 days assigned to the current user:</p><pre class="programlisting">created &gt; startOfDay("-2d") and assignee = currentUser() &#13;
</pre><p>This query will be saved as a filter and the result will be displayed using a gadget in the dashboard. A query similar to this can be used by all the users in a team and the output will be different for everyone because instead of a specific value, we will use a specific function.</p><p>The following table shows some of the common functions:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec22"/>Browser shortcuts</h1></div></div></div><p>When you start using JIRA regularly, you will save time used when carrying out common everyday tasks, such as creating issues, going to the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong>, performing a quick search, and so on.</p><p>When you log in to your JIRA instance, the dashboard will open. Let's say that you want to go to the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> window quickly. Perform the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Press <em>G</em> + <em>I</em>:<p>This will take you directly to your <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> window in a few seconds. If you use <strong>Detail View</strong> in the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> window, the details of the first issue will be displayed.</p></li><li class="listitem">Press <em>J</em>:<p>The next issue in the list will be displayed.</p></li><li class="listitem">Press <em>K</em>:<p>Now you are back to the first issue. While browsing the issues, you suddenly remember that you need to create a ticket.</p></li><li class="listitem">Press <em>C</em>:<p>This will open the <strong>Create Issue</strong> screen for you.</p></li><li class="listitem">Press <em>/</em>:<p>This will shift the mouse focus to the quick search box at the top. There are a lot of similar shortcuts for various operations in JIRA (it will take time to learn and remember these). Start with some common shortcuts that we mentioned here and, with time, learn more.</p></li></ol></div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip17"/>Tip</h3><p>For a complete list of keyboard shortcuts, refer to <a class="ulink" href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Keyboard+Shortcuts">https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/JIRA/Using+Keyboard+Shortcuts</a>.</p></div></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec23"/>Exporting issues in Excel, RSS, XML, and JSON</h1></div></div></div><p>From time to time, you will need to bring these issues out of JIRA and place them in an Excel sheet where you can create complex pivot charts based on the information retrieved. JIRA will let you export these issues in a few standard formats (such as RSS, XML, and Excel).</p><p>At the top-right corner of the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> pane, there is a button called <strong>Export</strong>. When you press this button, you will see several options:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_011.jpg" alt="Exporting issues in Excel, RSS, XML, and JSON"/></div><p>
</p><p>When you click on <strong>XML</strong>, the issues currently visible in the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> pane will open up in an XML format in your browser. You can save this page as an XML file.</p><p>Similarly, you can generate an RSS feed for either <strong>Issues</strong> or <strong>Comments</strong>. This will give you the URL to access the RSS feed, which you can use in your favorite feed reader. The URL of this feed is the same and whenever there is an update in the list, the RSS feed will be updated automatically.</p><p>There are also options to export the issues in <strong>Word</strong>, <strong>Excel (All fields)</strong>, or <strong>Excel (Current fields)</strong>. The export in Excel is quite useful when you want to generate custom reports on the data pulled out from JIRA.</p><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl2sec28"/>Enabling JSON export in JIRA</h2></div></div></div><p>JSON is a popular format that is used in communicating data between various applications. It is a language-independent format used that can be parsed and processed by a variety of programming languages.</p><p>The ability to export JIRA issues in JSON format is disabled by default but follow these steps to enable this facility in your JIRA instance:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to JIRA, <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Add-ons</strong> | <strong>Manage add-ons</strong> under <strong>ATLASSIAN MARKETPLACE</strong> and change the filter to include <strong>All add-ons</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Under the <strong>System add-ons</strong> grouping, search for the add-on named <strong>jira-importers-plugin</strong> and expand its submodules as shown in the following screenshot:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_012.jpg" alt="Enabling JSON export in JIRA"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">When the submodules are expanded, find the two modules named <strong>searchrequest-json</strong> and <strong>issue-json</strong> and enable them:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_013.jpg" alt="Enabling JSON export in JIRA"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Now go back to the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong> and you will find a new option under <strong>Export</strong> called <strong>JSON</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_014.jpg" alt="Enabling JSON export in JIRA"/></div><p>
</p></li></ol></div><p>Exporting the issues in JSON is quite a useful feature, especially for developers who want to build tools to pull data from JIRA. The ability to have the issues in JSON format will be of great benefit to them.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec24"/>Bulk editing</h1></div></div></div><p>Another powerful feature in JIRA is bulk editing in the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong>. This feature lets you modify the attributes of multiple issues simultaneously. There are several cases when you may need to perform such an action. For example, an employee has left the company and someone else has joined instead of this employee. Now, there might be several hundred issues assigned to him that are not yet closed in JIRA; these issues should ideally be assigned to a new user using the following steps:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">First, refine the search results so that you can see all the issues assigned to the old user:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_015.jpg" alt="Bulk editing"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">From the top-right corner, click on the <strong>Tools</strong> button and then under <strong>Bulk Change:</strong>, select <strong>all 26 issue(s)</strong>. If you have 50 issues in the search results, then this number will be 50.</li><li class="listitem">Tick the issues you want to modify:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_016.jpg" alt="Bulk editing"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">You have the option to either select all the issues at once or select a few that you want to modify. Click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">Choose the operation and select the first option, that is, <strong>Edit Issues</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_017.jpg" alt="Bulk editing"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Select the modification that needs to be done:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_018.jpg" alt="Bulk editing"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In this step, you will get the option to select the field that you want to modify. You will also get the option to select its new value. As we want to change the <strong>Assignee</strong>, select it using the checkbox and search for the new user to whom you want to assign all the issues.<p>The bulk editing feature also allows you to modify multiple attributes. Maybe you also want to change the <strong>Due Date</strong>. So simply select another attribute using the checkbox and click on the <strong>Next</strong> button.</p></li><li class="listitem">Review your change:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_02_019.jpg" alt="Bulk editing"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">In the preceding screen, just review the changes that you wish to perform. For instance, in our case, this screen will display the change in <strong>Assignee</strong>. When you are sure that the change is correct, then click on the <strong>Confirm</strong> button.</li><li class="listitem">After the bulk edit is done, you will be taken back to the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong>.<div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="tip18"/>Tip</h3><p>Using the bulk edit feature, multiple issues can be modified; however, it's possible that some of the operations, such as the <strong>Edit</strong>, <strong>Move</strong>, or <strong>Delete</strong> issue, are disabled. The reason for this is that the user who is performing the bulk change may not have permission to execute that operation on all the issues selected for bulk change.</p></div></div></li></ol></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch02lvl1sec25"/>Summary</h1></div></div></div><p>In this chapter, we discussed how issues can be searched in JIRA using the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong>. We covered the <strong>Basic</strong> search as well as the <strong>Advanced</strong> search using JQL. Creating filters and subscribing to it were also covered. We also discussed how to modify issues in bulk and how to export issues from the <strong>Issue Navigator</strong>.</p><p>Once you start using JIRA to track issues, it also becomes important to analyze the data to check the progress of the project. In the next chapter, various built-in reports that come with JIRA will be discussed. These real-time reports help managers to check various project statistics and make the right decisions. The dashboards and gadgets will also be discussed briefly.</p></div></body></html>
