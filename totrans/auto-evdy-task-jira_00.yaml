- en: Jira started life as a tool for developers to track bugs in their software and,
    over the years, has evolved into a powerful project management platform, allowing
    organizations to plan, manage, and track work across multiple teams and across
    software, service management, and business projects.

- en: Over time, this has enabled teams to keep on top of their projects; however,
    it comes at a price of administrative overhead, with users having to constantly
    perform simple and repetitive tasks in order to ensure that Jira issues stay relevant
    to the work being performed.

    to automate tasks in Jira without needing to write any code. This has since been
    incorporated into Jira Cloud as a native feature, while still being offered as
    an optional add-on for users of server-based Jira products.
