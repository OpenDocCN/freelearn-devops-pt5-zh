- en: Every good agilist knows that individuals and interactions are valued over processes
    and tools. This first tenet of the manifesto endures two decades since its formation.
    Yet in today's world of digital disruption, the right practices and tools can
    mean the difference between surviving and thriving.

    all leading frameworks, enables you to scale agility from the team to the enterprise,
    and visualizes all key dimensions including people, work, time, and outcomes?
    Well, that tool is here, and it's called Jira Align.
