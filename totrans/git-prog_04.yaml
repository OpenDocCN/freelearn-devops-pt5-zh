    merges. You will also see how to handle merge conflicts and tools to make managing
    conflicts easier. You will learn about pull requests and the difference between
    a fast-forward merge and a "true" merge.

    tested, you will want to merge your branch back into the main branch. Some organizations
    let you simply merge, others (most?) require that you create a **Pull Request
    (PR)**. A **PR** says, essentially, "Please examine my code and if you think it
    is right, merge it into the main branch."
