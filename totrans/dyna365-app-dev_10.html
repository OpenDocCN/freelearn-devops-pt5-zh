<p>In Chapter 9, <em>Using Editable Grids in Apps</em><span>,</span> we learned how to configure Editable Grid and how to make use of different methods and events supported by the Grid. In this chapter, we will look into Microsoft Cognitive Services and how to integrate them with Dynamics 365. Microsoft Cognitive Services is a collection of APIs, which can be used to add artificial intelligence capabilities into applications.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">The Cognitive Services Integration with Dynamics 365 is still in Public Preview and is only available for instances in the <strong>United States</strong> (<strong>US</strong>) region.</div>
<p>In this chapter, we will be covering the following points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overview of Microsoft Cognitive Services</li>
<li>Connect Dynamics 365 with Microsoft Cognitive Services</li>
<li>Implement Text Analytics APIs for suggesting knowledge articles, similar cases, and document suggestions</li>
</ul>

<p>Microsoft Cognitive Services can be defined as a collection of APIs that can be easily configured and consumed to bring powerful artificial intelligence capabilities to applications, websites, and bots. Microsoft Cognitive Services are standard JSON-based REST APIs which can be consumed from a number of popular languages like Curl, C#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, and so on. Early in 2015, Microsoft had released a set of technologies under Project Oxford that allowed developers to build more intelligent apps incorporating Machine Learning aspects, which was then later rebranded to Microsoft Cognitive Services. Currently, Microsoft Cognitive Services consists of different APIs such as Computer Vision API, Video API, Bing Speech API, Text Analytics API, Recommendations API, Bing Image Search API<span>, and so on,</span> categorized into Vision, Speech, Language, Knowledge and Speech.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">A list of different Microsoft Cognitive Services APIs is available at <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/directory/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/cognitive-services/directory/</a>.</div>
<p>Let us have a quick look at these different APIs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Vision APIs</strong>: These allow an app to recognize faces, emotions, and understand images and videos. It includes Computer Vision API, Video API, Face API, Emotion API, and so on. To see Face API in action, we can browse to <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/</a></span> and can submit an image, and Face API will analyze the image and will return the result in JSON as shown in the following screenshot, in the Detection result:</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="224" src="assets/43a8b1ca-37ed-4be3-8c52-db717ae06e27.png" width="519"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Speech APIs</strong><span>: These allow an app to recognize speech, convert speech to text and text to speech. It includes Speech Recognition API and Text to Speech API. Too see Speech API in action</span>, browse to <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/speech/</a></span>and either play any of the samples or start recording. The Speech Recognition API will convert the spoken word to text as shown here:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Language APIs</strong>: This allows an app to evaluate sentiment and topics to understand what users want, detect and correct a misspelling and other capabilities. It includes Text Analytics API, Translator Text API, Bing Spell Check API and so on. To see spell check capabilities in action, browse to <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/spell-check/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/spell-check/</a></span>. On entering <kbd>Spell</kbd> incorrectly as <kbd>Spel</kbd> and clicking on <span class="packt_screen">Submit</span>, it is autocorrected to <span class="packt_screen">Spell</span> as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>Knowledge APIs</strong>: This allows an app to give recommendations based on customers, wants, decision-making capabilities and integration with a rich knowledge base collected from the web, academics, and so on. It includes Recommendation API, QnA Maker API, Academic Knowledge API, and so on. An organization can use Recommendation API to understand sales behavior and recommend related products to customers during purchase, which can result in increased sales. To see the QnA Maker API in action, browse to <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/qna-maker/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/qna-maker/</a></span>and search for a particular keyword. Searching for <kbd>Login</kbd> matches with the question <span class="packt_screen">how do I login to the qna maker portal?</span> and returns the appropriate answer as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="251" src="assets/0bd0a2c2-50bb-4af0-b7c9-5e50f4c4169e.png" width="518"/></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Search APIs</strong>: Using this, an app can have access to web pages, images, videos, news and so on, along with autosuggestion capabilities using the power of Bing APIs. It includes Bing Autosuggest API, Bing Image Search API, Bing News Search API, Bing Web Search API <span>and so on</span>. To see the Bing News Search API in action, browse to <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-news-search-api/">https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-news-search-api/</a></span> and search for <kbd>Dynamics 365</kbd>. The Bing New Search API will respond with all the news pertaining to the Dynamics 365 as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ul>

<p>Through Knowledge Base Suggestions, Dynamics 365 can suggest similar Knowledge Base articles to the user related to the case the user is working on. This can help the user to quickly resolve the case, which would result in higher customer satisfaction.</p>
<p>For enabling Knowledge Base Suggestions, first, we need to set up a knowledge search field in Dynamics 365:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Service Management</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Knowledge Search Field Settings.</span></li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">New</span> to create a <span class="packt_screen">KNOWLEDGE SEARCH MODEL</span> as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="280" src="assets/beda7fd2-2ed4-45eb-a992-8dd951560c40.png" width="431"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>For a <strong><span>KNOWLEDGE SEARCH MODEL</span></strong> record:
<ul>
<li><strong>Name: </strong>Name specifies the name of the model.</li>
<li><strong>Source entity: </strong>Source entity specifies the entity to enable a text search rule for finding matching records. Out of the box, we can select <span class="packt_screen">Case Entity</span>. To enable it for any other entity, we need to open that entity for customization and enable <span class="packt_screen">Knowledge Management</span> under <span class="packt_screen">Communication &amp; Collaboration</span>. In the following screenshot, it is seen that we have enabled <span class="packt_screen">Knowledge Management</span> for the Lead Entity:</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/be486165-c598-45b6-960c-725d995cfbec.png"/></div>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><strong>Maximum number of key phrases: </strong>This specifies a maximum number of key phrases to be taken into consideration. Allowed values are between 0 to 1,000.</li>
<li><strong>Description: </strong>This specifies the optional description for the model.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>After creating the model, next we need to define the fields which will be used for a keyword or key phrase determination. Here, we have defined a <span class="packt_screen">Text Analytics Entity Mappings</span> record on the <span class="packt_screen">Case Title</span> field of case entity, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="129" src="assets/9f6b5905-b9e3-4960-9be5-0324b5747b00.png" width="379"/></div>
<ol start="5">
<li>For a <span class="packt_screen">Text Analytics Entity Mappings</span> record:
<ul>
<li><strong>Entity name: </strong>Specifies the source entities which have Knowledge Management enabled. Here Activity Entities and Entities having <em>1 - N</em> or <em>N - 1</em> relationship to the source entity can be selected</li>
<li><strong>Field name: </strong>Specifies Single Line of text, Multiple Line of text and Option Set fields of the selected entity for finding matching knowledge base records.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">ACTIVATE</span> to enable the Model, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="79" src="assets/81e0bc64-6dcb-416e-91a9-263b3c85317e.png" width="419"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>Update the Case form to add the Knowledge Base Suggestions. Enable <span class="packt_screen">Turn on automatic suggestions</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Text Analytics</span> in the<strong> </strong><span class="packt_screen">Give knowledge base (KB) suggestions using</span> field, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<ol start="8">
<li>Click <span class="packt_screen">OK</span> to close the properties dialog box and click <span class="packt_screen">Save</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Publish</span> the form.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="9">
<li>To see it in action, open any of the case records, and go to KB records. Here, based on the Case title—that is, <span class="packt_screen">Need help with 3D printer components</span>, clicking on the <span class="packt_screen">KB RECORDS</span> tab shows the corresponding Knowledge Based article matching the title of the case, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="431" src="assets/afb38cf7-1674-46c7-afd5-f27f86ce91ec.png" width="725"/></div>
<p>Similarly, we can define a model for a Lead entity (or any other entity having Knowledge Management enabled) based on the Topic field as a keyword or key phrase determination field, and can customize the lead to include KB Records suggestions. Based on the <span class="packt_screen">Topic</span>, that is, <span class="packt_screen">Audio</span>, the <span class="packt_screen">KB RECORDS</span> suggests a KB article having <span class="packt_screen">Audio</span> in its title, as shown <span>in the following screenshot:</span></p>

<p>Through Similar Record Suggestions, users while working on a particular record inside Dynamics 365, can quickly find similar records and can use this information to better serve their customers. For example, while working on a case, users can find similar cases and can use the information in those similar cases to resolve the current case.</p>
<p>To configure Similar Records Suggestions in Dynamics 365:</p>
<ol start="1">
<li>Connect Text Analysis Connection with Dynamics 365, which we have already done earlier</li>
<li>Inside Dynamics 365, go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Data Management</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Similar Records Suggestions Settings.</span></li>
</ol>
<ol start="3">
<li>Create a new <span class="packt_screen">Advanced Similarity Rules</span> for the Case entity as shown<span> </span><span>in the following screenshot:</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="444" src="assets/e1df6ede-fc21-4b47-94f3-956c8f59ff1d.png" width="537"/></div>
<p style="padding-left: 60px">In the <span class="packt_screen">ADVANCED SIMILARITY RULE</span> record:</p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Name</span>:<strong> </strong>Specifies the name of the rule.</li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Source Entity</span>: Specifies the entity on which the rule is being configured.

<li><span class="packt_screen">Maximum Number of Key Phrases</span>: Specifies Maximum number of keywords to be considered while performing text searches. Allows values between 0 to 1,000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">

<p>Through Document Suggestions, users can be made aware of all the important relevant documents related to the record that they are working on, which can help them while working on a high priority case or a big opportunity. The suggested documents could be of type Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, Adobe PDF, and text files. Microsoft Azure Text Analytics uses the Similarity Rule defined to find the related records and then presents the list of suggested documents associated with them. The users can either open the document or can copy those documents to the current record. Document Suggestions searches only the locations and documents that the user has access to. The locations where it can search include SharePoint Sites, One Drive, Office 365 Groups, and external URLs:</p>

<p><span>To configure Similar Document Suggestions in Dynamics 365:</span></p>
<ol>
<li>Connect Text Analysis Connection with Dynamics 365, which we have already done.</li>
<li>Inside Dynamics 365, go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Document Management</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Manage Document Suggestions</span>:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="3">
<li>If entities are not configured for Document Suggestions we will get the following notification:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Let us enable it for <span class="packt_screen">Case</span> entity. Open <span class="packt_screen">Case Entity for Customization</span> and enable <span class="packt_screen">Document Management</span> and publish the Entity:</li>

<ol start="6">
<li>After enabling Document Suggestions, the next step is to create a Similar Record Suggestion rule for Case entity. Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span>| <span class="packt_screen">Data Management</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Similar Record Suggestions Settings</span>. Here, we will use our existing rule that we had created earlier based on <span class="packt_screen">Case Title</span>, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<ol start="7">
<li>To see it in action, let us open the same case record that we opened in the case of Similar Record Suggestions that is, with the title <span class="packt_screen">Service Requested</span> which resulted in 10 similar case records being suggested, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>

<p>To monitor our configured Text Analytics Service:</p>
<ol>
<li>Log in to the Azure Portal</li>
<li>Open the Text Analytics API created</li>
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Metrics</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">MONITORING</span> section, which allows us to select various metrics like <span class="packt_screen">Data In</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Data Out</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Total Calls</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Total Errors</span>, and so on, and displays the result in a line chart:</li>
</ol>

<p>In this chapter, we covered an overview of Microsoft Cognitive Services and how to use Text Analytics API for suggesting knowledge articles, similar cases, and documents in Dynamics 365.</p>
<p>In <a href="428bac6b-b00d-45e5-a454-118c9b7e1879.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 11</a>, <em>Train the Users Through Learning Path</em>, we will look at the Learning Path authoring, which allows us to create our own custom Help experience for our Dynamics 365 users. Through this new feature, we can reduce training time and costs and make users more productive using Dynamics 365.</p>
