<h1 id="_idParaDest-296"><a id="_idTextAnchor297"/>Assuring Security and Compliance</h1>
<p>In this book, we only use Confluence’s Cloud version. Therefore, it’s important to note that your security-related work here is more accessible compared to the Server and Data Center versions. However, this does not mean that you are 100% secure. You should put in a lot of effort to keep the environment safe. In this chapter, we will give numerous security-related tips and a short yet practical guide to keep your Confluence environment much safer.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The basic concepts of information security</li>
<li>The advantages of the Confluence Cloud edition over the Server and Data Center editions</li>
<li>Security measures on Confluence</li>
<li>Atlassian Access</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-297"><a id="_idTextAnchor298"/>The basic concepts of information security</h1>
<p>Being <a id="_idIndexMarker815"/>familiar with the basic concepts related to information security will significantly assist you in securing the Confluence environment you manage. Here, we will go over a few of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Authentication</strong>: Verifying users’ identities<a id="_idIndexMarker816"/> helps ensure that only authorized individuals gain<a id="_idIndexMarker817"/> access</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Authorization</strong>: Determining <a id="_idIndexMarker818"/>what different users and roles can access helps <a id="_idIndexMarker819"/>prevent information from falling into the wrong hands</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Encryption</strong>: Encrypting <a id="_idIndexMarker820"/>sensitive information in storage and during transmission makes <a id="_idIndexMarker821"/>unauthorized access more difficult</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Firewalls and network security</strong>: This <a id="_idIndexMarker822"/>helps protect a network <a id="_idIndexMarker823"/>against internal and external threats</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data integrity</strong>: Maintaining<a id="_idIndexMarker824"/> the accuracy and consistency of data is critical for secure and <a id="_idIndexMarker825"/>accurate decision-making</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Privacy and compliance</strong>: Personal <a id="_idIndexMarker826"/>and sensitive data must be protected, and appropriate legal and<a id="_idIndexMarker827"/> regulatory requirements must be met (e.g., GDPR)</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Monitoring and log management</strong>: Tracking and<a id="_idIndexMarker828"/> recording security events can help you detect and <a id="_idIndexMarker829"/>respond to abnormal behavior quickly</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Backup and disaster recovery</strong>: Regular backups and effective disaster recovery plans are<a id="_idIndexMarker830"/> necessary for business <a id="_idIndexMarker831"/>continuity if there is data loss</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Risk management</strong>: Identifying, assessing, and<a id="_idIndexMarker832"/> managing potential security risks <a id="_idIndexMarker833"/>provides proactive protection</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Training and awareness</strong>: Users <a id="_idIndexMarker834"/>should be trained in security best practices and policies</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Security policies and procedures</strong>: Security policies<a id="_idIndexMarker835"/> should<a id="_idIndexMarker836"/> clearly articulate an organization’s security needs and expectations</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Third-party plugins and security</strong>: The security of plugins is an integral part of a platform’s <a id="_idIndexMarker837"/>overall security, so adding plugins exclusively from trusted sources is crucial</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Human factor</strong>: People<a id="_idIndexMarker838"/> can be the weakest link, so it is <a id="_idIndexMarker839"/>fundamental to train employees on security protocols</li>
</ul>
<p>These concepts can form the building blocks of an overall security strategy when using Confluence Cloud. Also, they can be modified according to an organization’s specific needs.</p>
<p>Using Confluence Cloud<a id="_idIndexMarker840"/> has significant security differences compared to other editions (Server and Data Center). Understanding these differences, and grasping Atlassian’s approach to this matter, will help you lay a solid foundation in terms of security. In the next section, we will discuss the advantages of the Cloud edition.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-298"><a id="_idTextAnchor299"/>The advantages of the Confluence Cloud edition over the Server and Data Center editions</h1>
<p>By using<a id="_idIndexMarker841"/> Confluence’s Cloud edition, you're delegating numerous routine operations related to information security to Atlassian, which becomes one of the biggest advantages of cloud-based services. In this section, we will briefly summarize the advantages of using Confluence in a cloud-based manner:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Updates and patching</strong>: Security updates and patches are applied automatically in the Cloud edition, providing rapid protection against security vulnerabilities and eliminating manual patching</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Compliance with regulations</strong>: Confluence Cloud often ensures compliance with specific legal and regulatory standards (e.g., GDPR), reducing the need for organizations to manage these requirements independently</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Network security</strong>: Atlassian manages network security against threats such as DDoS attacks, helping with the in-house security burden</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Data encryption</strong>: Confluence Cloud ensures data encryption during transit and storage, which is a more effective and efficient route compared to developing in-house encryption solutions</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Access control</strong>: The Cloud edition offers various access control features such as authentication and authorization, facilitating straightforward management of user capabilities</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Disaster recovery</strong>: Atlassian offers integrated backup and disaster recovery solutions, ensuring business continuity without organizations having to create their disaster recovery plans</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Scalability</strong>: The Cloud edition can be scaled if needed, allowing effective distribution of security resources</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Third-party security audits</strong>: Atlassian receives third-party security audits and has compliance certifications, which can provide additional assurance in evaluating and verifying security</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Cost-effectiveness</strong>: Atlassian <a id="_idIndexMarker842"/>manages the security infrastructure, reducing the costs for organizations to build and maintain their security systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Despite all these benefits, using the Cloud edition can come with risks and challenges, especially concerning data localization and third-party provider security. However, you can reduce potential threats with a sound risk management strategy and appropriate security protocols.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-299"><a id="_idTextAnchor300"/>Atlassian Cloud security shared responsibilities</h2>
<p>Atlassian emphasizes<a id="_idIndexMarker843"/> security, compliance, and dependability with the Cloud version, which includes the applications, the systems operating them, and the environment they are hosted in. Atlassian ensures that all related standards, such as ISO27001, SOC2, and GDPR, align with Atlassian Trust Center. As Confluence users, you have control over your account data, users, and the choice of Marketplace apps you decide to trust. Your responsibility also includes the compliant utilization of Confluence within your organization.</p>
<p>Your choices in configuring Confluence impact how security gets implemented, so we will underline the important options you can pay attention to:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can authenticate one or several domains to affirm ownership by you or your organization. This verification and user claims enable centralized handling of all Atlassian accounts for employees and enforcement of authentication rules (such as password regulations, two-factor authentication, and SAML). After domain confirmation, users within that domain who already have Atlassian accounts get claimed. New sign-ups in that domain will know they are receiving a supervised account.</li>
<li>Atlassian’s offerings are crafted to foster collaboration, necessitating access. You must, however, exercise caution in authorizing access to your information to others and Marketplace apps. Once permissions are set, Atlassian can’t prevent users from executing actions allowed by those permissions, even if you don’t sanction such actions. Some products permit you to give public anonymous access to your data. If you authorize this access, you may lose control over further distribution or copying of that information.</li>
<li>We strongly suggest you use Atlassian Access for collective administration and increased security across all Atlassian tools (including mandatory <strong class="bold">two-factor authentication</strong> (<strong class="bold">2FA</strong>) and<a id="_idIndexMarker844"/> single sign-on). Atlassian Access is an Atlassian product that empowers organizations of any size to add <a id="_idIndexMarker845"/>enterprise-grade <strong class="bold">identity and access management</strong> (<strong class="bold">IAM</strong>) features to their central admin console. You can<a id="_idIndexMarker846"/> enhance data security and governance for your Atlassian Cloud products with Atlassian Access.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-300"><a id="_idTextAnchor301"/>What security risks should remote teams be aware of when using Confluence Cloud?</h2>
<p>Remote teams can benefit from Confluence Cloud to facilitate collaboration, but it also comes with certain <a id="_idIndexMarker847"/>cybersecurity dangers. Some of them are listed here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Phishing attacks</strong>: Remote workers might be more susceptible to phishing attacks. These attacks are often executed via fake emails or messages and can direct users to counterfeit Confluence login pages.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Weak authentication</strong>: Without additional security measures such as 2FA, individuals with bad intentions can access accounts.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Insufficient data encryption</strong>: Failing to encrypt data during transit or storage can increase the risk of accessing sensitive information.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Insecure connections</strong>: Remote workers often connect via home or public Wi-Fi networks. As these networks are generally not as secure as workplace networks, the risk of data leakage increases.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Access control breaches</strong>: Granting access to unauthorized individuals accidentally or deliberately can allow access to significant information.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Third-party plugins</strong>: Untrusted third-party plugins may lead to malicious activities or data breaches on the platform.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Irregular updates and patch implementation</strong>: Neglecting regular security updates and patches can leave your system vulnerable to exploitation through known vulnerabilities.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Backup and disaster recovery deficiencies</strong>: In remote work setups, skipping routine backup and disaster recovery plans can result in data loss.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Human errors</strong>: Remote workers may be less exposed to security protocols than in-house employees. Lack of training, distractions, or incorrect configuration can lead to security breaches.</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Legal and compliance issues</strong>: Teams working in different regions may struggle with<a id="_idIndexMarker848"/> compliance with local laws and regulations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Remote teams should adopt a comprehensive security strategy to overcome these potential threats, including using secure connection protocols, implementing robust authentication, providing regular security training, and reviewing security policies.</p>
<p>In this section, we learned that there are many security-related advantages to using Confluence’s Cloud edition. Unfortunately, these alone are not enough to make Confluence secure; there is much work to be done by Confluence users and administrators to ensure safety. In the next section, we will discuss the security measures that can be taken on Confluence.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-301"><a id="_idTextAnchor302"/>Security measures on Confluence</h1>
<p>Learning <a id="_idIndexMarker849"/>what you can do regarding security will help create an<a id="_idIndexMarker850"/> effective and sustainable information security policy. It is also beneficial to think about the following layers of security in the Confluence environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Atlassian site and Confluence security settings</li>
<li>Securing user accounts</li>
<li>Securing Confluence spaces</li>
<li>Securing Confluence pages</li>
<li>Security on Atlassian Marketplace apps</li>
<li>Securing integrations</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-302"><a id="_idTextAnchor303"/>Atlassian site and Confluence security settings</h2>
<p>When you view Confluence’s<a id="_idIndexMarker851"/> settings, you <a id="_idIndexMarker852"/>will see many options in the <strong class="bold">SECURITY</strong> section.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_01_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.1 – The SECURITY section of the Atlassian site and Confluence security settings</p>
<p>As shown in the previous screenshot, there are six options in the <strong class="bold">SECURITY</strong> section:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Users</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Groups</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Security Configuration</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Global Permissions</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Space Permissions</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Analytics Permissions</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s go through these one by one.</p>
<h3>Users</h3>
<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker853"/> previous sections of this book, we saw how to manage users. Now, we will provide security recommendations regarding user accounts.</p>
<p>We suggest making user management as lean and fully automatic as possible. We strongly recommend using another Atlassian product, Access, for the highest security concerning user accounts. We will discuss Access again in the later sections of the book.</p>
<h3>Groups</h3>
<p>Managing users in<a id="_idIndexMarker854"/> groups will make you more resilient against potential changes you may experience in a team. Applying permissions, restrictions, and automation based on groups rather than individuals will make managing the Confluence environment easier. This way, you will have to spend less effort keeping a system secure.</p>
<h3>Security Configuration</h3>
<p>You can click on the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> button at the top right to change the settings under the <strong class="bold">Security</strong> and <strong class="bold">Privacy</strong> tab.</p>
<p>Here, we recommend the following settings under <strong class="bold">Security Configuration</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Activate the <strong class="bold">Hide External Links From Search </strong><strong class="bold">Engines</strong> feature.</li>
<li>Turn off the <strong class="bold">Anonymous Access to Remote </strong><strong class="bold">API</strong> feature.</li>
<li>Activate the <code>3</code> in the space provided. You can ensure that CAPTCHA is triggered if more than three mistakes are made on the login screen.</li>
<li>Enable the <strong class="bold">Secure administrator sessions</strong> feature, which allows you to require administrators to re-enter their password before they can access administrative functions.</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_02_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.2 – Edit Security Configuration</p>
<p>As you can<a id="_idIndexMarker855"/> see in the previous screenshot, this screen has many settings. However, some of them are inactive. When you press the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> button, you’ll see that you can’t change some of the settings here.</p>
<h3>Global permissions</h3>
<p>Here, you can set what <a id="_idIndexMarker856"/>user groups can do in your Confluence environment.</p>
<p>On the <strong class="bold">Global permissions</strong> screen, you will see five tabs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">User groups</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Guests</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Anonymous access</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">JSM access</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Apps</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the following <a id="_idIndexMarker857"/>screenshot, you can see the contents of the <strong class="bold">User </strong><strong class="bold">groups</strong> tab.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_03_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.3 – Global permissions | User groups</p>
<p>As you can see, you can set user groups’ permissions here. There are two of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Personal space</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Create </strong><strong class="bold">a space</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at the other tabs in turn. In the following screenshot, you can see the <strong class="bold">Guests</strong> tab, which is a fairly new feature of Confluence.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_04_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.4 – Global permissions | Guests</p>
<p>As seen, what guest accounts do is clearly explained on this screen. By default, guests will have the following space permission settings: View/Add/Edit/ pages, comments, and attachments. </p>
<p>With Atlassian's external user security features, you can manage guests with added security such as two-step verification, periodic re-verification, and API token access.</p>
<p>Note that guests are not counted in the license, but there are some limits – guests are free of charge, at a maximum of five guests per paid user. The total number of users (paid and guests) can’t exceed the current Confluence site user limit. More information can be found here: <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/invite-guests-for-external-collaboration/">https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/invite-guests-for-external-collaboration/</a>.</p>
<p>We recommend being very careful when granting access to guests.</p>
<p>Now, let’s take a look at<a id="_idIndexMarker858"/> the <strong class="bold">Anonymous access</strong> tab on the <strong class="bold">Global </strong><strong class="bold">permissions</strong> screen.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_05_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.5 – Global permissions | Anonymous access</p>
<p>As shown in the previous screenshot, there are two permissions you can give to anonymous users:</p>
<ul>
<li>Permission to use Confluence</li>
<li>Permission to view Confluence users’ profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>When you grant anonymous users the right to use Confluence, Confluence space administrators can open their managed space to anonymous users, which presents a significant risk. If not handled carefully, your confidential information can be exposed globally. Therefore, we recommend being very cautious when granting access to anonymous users.</p>
<p>You can see the <strong class="bold">JSM access</strong> tab on the <strong class="bold">Global permissions</strong> screen on the next screen. In the previous sections, we mentioned that <strong class="bold">Jira Service Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">JSM</strong>) and <a id="_idIndexMarker859"/>Confluence can be integrated, so you can serve the content you prepared on Confluence to your customers as a knowledge base through the customer portal on JSM.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_06_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.6 – Global permissions | JSM access</p>
<p>As you can<a id="_idIndexMarker860"/> see in the previous screenshot, there are two permissions you can give to JSM users:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Use Confluence</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">View </strong><strong class="bold">User Profile</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>This looks similar to the screen that we just saw where we granted permissions to anonymous users. However, here, you give these permissions to customers with access to the customer portal on JSM rather than anyone on the internet. Therefore, you have a bit more control here compared to anonymous accounts. We also want to remind you of the risk here – if you’re not careful, you may accidentally make your confidential content accessible to customers on JSM. Therefore, we recommend being very cautious when activating this feature.</p>
<p>In the following screenshot, you can see the <strong class="bold">Apps</strong> tab on the <strong class="bold">Global permissions</strong> screen. Here, you can grant global permissions to applications. You won’t see any records here if no application is installed in your Confluence environment.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_07_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.7 – Global permissions | Apps</p>
<p>As shown in the <a id="_idIndexMarker861"/>previous screenshot, three global permissions can be granted to applications:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Personal Space</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Create Space</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">View </strong><strong class="bold">User Profile</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend being very cautious when granting global permissions to your Confluence applications.</p>
<h3>Default space permissions</h3>
<p>In the earlier<a id="_idIndexMarker862"/> sections of the book, we learned how to change the permissions on each space. In the following screenshot, you can see the interface where you can set the default permissions of a newly created space.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_08_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.8 – Space Permissions</p>
<p>As the<a id="_idIndexMarker863"/> previous screenshot shows, this screen looks very similar to the space permissions screen we saw in earlier parts of the book. There are two sections here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Default </strong><strong class="bold">Space Permissions</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Individual Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In the <strong class="bold">Default Space Permissions</strong> section, you can set the default permissions of the newly created spaces. If you work in a high-privacy environment, you may want to restrict the default permissions entirely. In the <strong class="bold">Individual Spaces</strong> section, you can see a list of all the spaces on Confluence and access their permissions screens with a single click.</p>
<h3>Analytics permissions</h3>
<p>You may<a id="_idIndexMarker864"/> remember when we mentioned the Analytics feature on Confluence earlier in the book. You can now set which user groups can use the Analytics feature through the interface shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_09_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.9 – Analytics Permissions</p>
<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker865"/>previous screenshot shows all the groups that have permission to use Analytics. You can determine which groups can use the Analytics feature using this interface.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-303"><a id="_idTextAnchor304"/>Securing user accounts</h2>
<p>For the <a id="_idIndexMarker866"/>highest security regarding user accounts, we strongly recommend using another Atlassian product, Access. With it, you will have important capabilities such as two-step verification, password requirements, and idle session duration. Note that you will need an additional subscription for this product, which we will discuss shortly.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-304"><a id="_idTextAnchor305"/>Securing Confluence spaces</h2>
<p>In earlier parts <a id="_idIndexMarker867"/>of the book, we<a id="_idIndexMarker868"/> learned that pages, the most essential components of Confluence, are located within spaces. Typically, each space has at least one administrator. The space administrator can determine in detail who will have what permissions on this space through the interface shown in the following screenshot.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_10_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.10 – Space permissions (part 1)</p>
<p>As you can see, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker869"/>assign permissions<a id="_idIndexMarker870"/> to user groups through this interface. In the following screenshot, you can see the second part of the same screen.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_11_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.11 – Space permissions (part 2)</p>
<p>As you can see, this<a id="_idIndexMarker871"/> interface allows you <a id="_idIndexMarker872"/>to grant permissions to individual users with a Confluence license, guest accounts, and anonymous accounts. Users with space management authority should be aware of fundamental Confluence security practices. Otherwise, they might inadvertently share sensitive content with unintended recipients.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-305"><a id="_idTextAnchor306"/>Securing Confluence pages</h2>
<p>All the information within <a id="_idIndexMarker873"/>Confluence gets<a id="_idIndexMarker874"/> collected on pages. This means if we fail to secure the pages, we can’t secure the information they contain. The following screenshot illustrates how you can set specific restrictions for each page.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_12_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.12 – Page restrictions</p>
<p>As shown in<a id="_idIndexMarker875"/> the previous screenshot, you <a id="_idIndexMarker876"/>can apply three different restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Anyone in this space can view </strong><strong class="bold">and edit</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Anyone in this space can view, only some </strong><strong class="bold">can edit</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Only specific people can view </strong><strong class="bold">or edit</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend you carefully apply viewing or editing restrictions on your page.</p>
<p>The <strong class="bold">Inspect permissions</strong> feature you can see in the following screenshot is very useful. With this feature, you can easily do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the root causes of access problems</li>
<li>Verify the restrictions you have applied to the pages</li>
</ul>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_13_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.13 – Inspect permissions</p>
<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker877"/>previous screenshot, the viewing <a id="_idIndexMarker878"/>permission for a user has been tested. Confluence indicates this user has access permission to the page; it even describes in detail how the user has obtained this permission. More information can be found here: <a href="https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/add-or-remove-page-restrictions/">https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/add-or-remove-page-restrictions/</a>.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-306"><a id="_idTextAnchor307"/>Security on Atlassian Marketplace apps</h2>
<p>As<a id="_idIndexMarker879"/> mentioned in <a id="_idIndexMarker880"/>previous chapters of the book, you can install apps in Confluence from the Atlassian Marketplace. In this section, we’ll provide security tips that may be helpful when selecting and using these apps.</p>
<p>Atlassian requires apps on the Marketplace to meet specific security standards. However, we still recommend being meticulous when selecting an app to install in Confluence. Here are some tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigate the app’s developer.</li>
<li>Read the app’s information on <a id="_idIndexMarker881"/>the Marketplace in detail. We recommend paying attention <a id="_idIndexMarker882"/>to the <strong class="bold">Privacy &amp; </strong><strong class="bold">Security</strong> tab.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the following two screenshots, you can see information about a popular app on the Atlassian Marketplace.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_14_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.14 – A Marketplace app’s Privacy &amp; Security information (part 1)</p>
<p>As you can see, you can <a id="_idIndexMarker883"/>find the app’s <strong class="bold">Data storage and management</strong> details<a id="_idIndexMarker884"/> here, such as what data the app processes and what it stores.</p>
<p>The following screenshot shows the rest of the <strong class="bold">Privacy &amp; Security</strong> information for the app.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_15_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 12.15 – A Marketplace app’s Privacy &amp; Security information (part 2)</p>
<p>As you can see in the<a id="_idIndexMarker885"/> previous<a id="_idIndexMarker886"/> screenshot, there are three sections in this tab:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Security </strong><strong class="bold">and compliance</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Privacy</strong></li>
<li><strong class="bold">Certification</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>We recommend reading all three sections in detail.</p>
<p>In the <strong class="bold">Certification</strong> section, you can see that this app has<a id="_idIndexMarker887"/> the <strong class="bold">Cloud Fortified</strong> certification. Take a look at what this certification means:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_12_16_B16861.jpg"/>

<p>The previous <a id="_idIndexMarker888"/>screenshot shows a detailed comparison of the <a id="_idIndexMarker889"/>three levels within the Atlassian Marketplace trust programs. We recommend comprehensive research of the applications you will use and using Cloud Fortified-featured applications as much as possible. Also, we strongly advise checking the security <a id="_idIndexMarker890"/>settings of the applications, carefully adjusting the permissions<a id="_idIndexMarker891"/> granted to the applications, and keeping up with developments related to the applications.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-307"><a id="_idTextAnchor308"/>Securing the Confluence Cloud mobile application</h2>
<p>The Confluence <a id="_idIndexMarker892"/>Cloud mobile app supports an <a id="_idIndexMarker893"/>organizational mobile app policy to apply additional security settings to a user’s Confluence app.</p>
<p>Follow the following steps to configure a mobile app policy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Access <a href="https://admin.atlassian.com">admin.atlassian.com</a>.</li>
<li>Select your organization (if you have more than one).</li>
<li>Click <strong class="bold">Security</strong> | <strong class="bold">Mobile policy</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong class="bold">Create </strong><strong class="bold">mobile policy</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="_idParaDest-308"><a id="_idTextAnchor309"/>Securing integrations</h2>
<p>In the earlier chapters, we learned<a id="_idIndexMarker894"/> that Confluence can integrate with many <a id="_idIndexMarker895"/>systems, primarily Atlassian applications. We strongly recommend handling the security of these integrations with care.</p>
<p>In this section, we saw numerous techniques that can be used to work securely on Confluence. Now, we'd like to mention that there is another Atlassian product that is not within the scope of Confluence but can enhance its security – Atlassian Access. In the next section, we will talk about this product.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-309"><a id="_idTextAnchor310"/>Atlassian Access</h1>
<p>Atlassian<a id="_idIndexMarker896"/> Access is another Atlassian product. Therefore, it falls outside the scope of this book. However, due to its frequent use with Confluence, we want to provide an overview of Access.</p>
<p>Atlassian Access is in the Enterprise plan and available to buy as a separate product if you are signed up to another plan, such as Premium.</p>
<p>With Access, you can make Confluence much more secure by providing additional authentication options and controls, allowing for a more robust defense against potential risks. Integrating Access with Confluence can form a seamless and safer user experience, reinforcing your organization’s security posture.</p>
<p>Your Atlassian Access subscription will apply across an organization, linking Atlassian Cloud services with your identity provider. This connection allows you to implement advanced authentication features and provides further supervision across different domains of your business. The key benefits<a id="_idIndexMarker897"/> are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connecting to your SAML SSO provider</li>
<li>Automating user provisioning (SCIM)</li>
<li>Enforcing two-step verification</li>
<li>Revoking unauthorized API tokens</li>
<li>Reviewing organization-wide audit logs</li>
<li>Gaining organization-wide insights</li>
<li>Maintaining <a id="_idIndexMarker898"/>visibility with automatic product discovery</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s common knowledge that no application open to the internet is 100 percent secure. Therefore, in the next section, we will discuss a few more security precautions.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-310"><a id="_idTextAnchor311"/>Additional recommendations for security</h1>
<p>Here are some <a id="_idIndexMarker899"/>additional recommendations to improve the security of your Confluence environment:</p>
