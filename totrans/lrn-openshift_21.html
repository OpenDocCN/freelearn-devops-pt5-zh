            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">At the time of writing this book, <strong class="calibre4">OpenShift Container Platform</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">OCP</strong>) 3.9 has been just released. OCP 3.9 is significantly different from the other releases, in that the earlier versions of OpenShift were one step behind a version of Kubernetes, meaning that OpenShift 3.5 was using Kubernetes 1.6, and OpenShift 3.7 was using Kubernetes 1.8. This is the main reason why Red Hat skipped version 3.8 and jumped right to 3.9, syncing up with Kubernetes 1.9. This does not mean that OpenShift 3.8 has been renamed 3.9, in fact, it is quite the opposite. OpenShift 3.9 includes all the new features from both 3.8 and 3.9, which includes the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">CRI-O</strong>: A lightweight <strong class="calibre1">Container Runtime Interface</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">CRI</strong>) that natively works with Kubernetes. It is designed to bring additional features into Kubernetes, such as the following:
<ul class="calibre29">
<li class="calibre10">Enhanced security</li>
<li class="calibre10">Better scalability and performance over traditional container runtime interfaces</li>
<li class="calibre10">Compatibility with any compliant <strong class="calibre1">Open Container Initiative</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">OCI</strong>), including Docker</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">Red Hat CloudForms Management Engine 4.6 Container Management</strong>: This is easy to use and to configure integration with Red Hat CloudForms through Ansible playbook installation, which includes following new features, updates, and older version enhancements:<br class="title-page-name"/>
<ul class="calibre29">
<li class="calibre10">OpenShift template provisioning</li>
<li class="calibre10">Alert management</li>
<li class="calibre10">Enhancements for UX</li>
<li class="calibre10">Enhancements for chargeback</li>
<li class="calibre10">Provider updates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">End-to-end online expansion and resize for containerized GlusterFS PV</strong>: This feature allows an OpenShift user to expand <strong class="calibre1">persistent volume</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">PV</strong>) claims online. Originally, this was only possible from the CLI.</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">Automated container native storage deployment with OpenShift container platform advances installation</strong>: This allows integration with file and block storage devices that are provided by the most popular cloud providers, including Amazon AWS, Google GCE, and Microsoft Azure.</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">Device plugins</strong>: A special plugin that allows you to use special devices in the OCP without the need to write any custom code. A device plugin is a portable solution to consume hardware resources across OpenShift clusters.</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">Support our own HAProxy RPM for consumption by the router</strong>: The capability of upgrading HAProxy routers under heavy load without causing any outages. OpenShift 3.9 allows you to perform seamless updates and upgrades.</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">Quick installation</strong>: This is now being deprecated. You will be able to install a new cluster using this method, but won't be able to perform any updates or upgrades. This method will be removed in the future version. Advanced installation should be used instead.</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">Automated 3.7 to 3.9 control plane upgrade</strong>: Using the advanced OpenShift installer through Ansible, it is possible to perform automated upgrades from 3.7 to 3.8 to 3.9. This includes the following:<br class="title-page-name"/>
<ul class="calibre29">
<li class="calibre10">API, controllers, and nodes on the control plane that host seamless 1 hop upgrades</li>
<li class="calibre10">Router, registry, service catalog, and brokers direct upgrade</li>
<li class="calibre10">Node, Docker, <span><strong class="calibre1">Open vSwitch</strong> (</span><strong class="calibre1">OVS</strong>) direct upgrade</li>
<li class="calibre10">Logging and metrics direct upgrade</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">Prometheus</strong>: This is a new product suite and a replacement for standard logging and metrics in OpenShift in the near future.</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">CLI plugins</strong>: A new feature that allows you to extend <kbd class="calibre12">oc</kbd> command capabilities with the new functionalities.</li>
</ul>

            <article>
                
<p class="calibre2">While it is still hard to predict what to expect from future OpenShift versions, we can derive some of this information from the technology preview features that you can find in the OCP 3.9 release notes as well as in the latest Red Hat events such as Red Hat Summit 2018, which took place from May 7 to May 11 in 2018. The good part is that the OCP software release cycle is every 3 months, which means that by the time you read this book, there is a chance that we will already have a new version of OpenShift coming out. The following table shows the difference between the versions of OCP in terms of <span class="calibre11"><strong class="calibre4">Tech Preview</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">TP</strong>) and <strong class="calibre4">General Availability</strong> (<strong class="calibre4">GA</strong>):</span></p>

<p class="calibre2">*Data is given based on our predictions.<br class="calibre5"/>
Besides all of the preceding data given here, we are going to see other OpenShift enhancements, such as the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre9">
<li class="calibre10">Prometheus cluster monitoring in conjunction with the Admin Web Console and operator <strong class="calibre1">lifecycle manager</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">LCM</strong>) features is going to make life easier for a <em class="calibre28">lazy</em> OpenShift admin, giving them a nice, easy to use and configured web console, functional enough to complete most of the tasks from a web interface. This is just one of the features that these projects are going to add together, but there is going to be so much more than that.</li>
<li class="calibre10">Istio and OpenShift service mesh products are going to bring OpenShift hybrid meshing to the next level by using on-demand service connections. Therefore, there will no longer be a need to provision such things manually.</li>
<li class="calibre10">One of the greatest things we are going to see in the future releases is seamless and easy to perform cluster upgrades and cluster scaling. What this means is that currently, we can only remove OpenShift nodes from the cluster without rebooting or restarting master nodes, but this is not the case with adding a new node. The process of adding a new node is not that fast nor always easy. So, what we are going to see in the upcoming releases is an ability to use <em class="calibre28">golden</em> images and the ability to add them to the cluster on the fly.</li>
<li class="calibre10">Integration with the OpenStack <span><strong class="calibre1">Infrastructure as a service</strong> (</span><strong class="calibre1">IaaS</strong>) platform is going to be closer to reality. We are going to see how OpenShift on OpenStack deployments can leverage this type of deployment by utilizing underlying OpenStack platform services like <strong class="calibre1">L</strong><span><strong class="calibre1">oad Balancer as a Service</strong> (</span><strong class="calibre1">LBaaS</strong>), <strong class="calibre1">F</strong><span><strong class="calibre1">irewall as a Service</strong> (</span><strong class="calibre1">FWaaS</strong>), <span><strong class="calibre1">DNS as a Service</strong> (</span><strong class="calibre1">DNSaaS</strong>), and so on, alongside further integration with tested and certified Neutron plugins, as well as bare metal servers provisioning and management through Ironic.</li>
<li class="calibre10">Another huge enhancement we are going to see in the future is OpenShift integration with CoreOS products such as CoreOS, Quay, and Tectonic. All of these products are very unique and useful when it comes to questioning how it is going to work with an OCP:
<ul class="calibre29">
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">CoreOS</strong>: This is an OS that is designed and built to run containers at scale. CoreOS has a really small footprint, it's lightweight, and has minimum functionality, which is enough to run containers and container orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">Quay</strong>: This is a highly distributed and reliable container registry for containers and Kubernetes, which allows you to run several instances of Quay to ensure redundancy out of the box. Quay also has a geo-replication feature available that allows seamless synchronization of your container images between different data centers. One of the other most important features of Quay is automatic container scanning for security vulnerabilities. This is one of the most requested security features in the container industry. Quay also has a continuous integration feature, which allows you to build and push images when developers commit the code, automatically.</li>
<li class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre1">Tectonic</strong>: This is a container orchestration platform by CoreOS, which works similarly to the OCP, but has a lot less functionality compared to OpenShift. The uniqueness of Tectonic is that its control plane services are running inside the Kubernetes service that Tectonic is managing. This is a classic chicken or the egg situation that CoreOS managed to solve.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre2">We are going to see most of these functionalities or the most requested features one way or the other migrated to or merged with the OCP. The whole of 2018 is probably going to be a little bit hectic for the OCP development team due to the recent acquisition of CoreOS. These teams are going to work together to decide which features to move forward with and which of them to let go forever. But no matter what, it is all going to benefit OpenShift and make it the most successful container management platform of all time.</p>
