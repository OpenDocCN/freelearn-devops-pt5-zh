			<p>Learning a new tool can be very daunting, especially software surrounding what often feels like the mystique of project management. But Atlassian has cleared much of the mystery of getting started with a revamp of its initial Jira Core offering for the cloud. </p>
			<p>This step-by-step, hands-on book will help you create your first project in practically no time and with little effort.

			<p>All of this and more in an easy browser-based tool provided by Atlassian, one of the world's leaders in project management software. Take a peek inside and let's get started!</p>
