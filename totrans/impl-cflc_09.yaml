    spaces! Being well versed in digital collaboration tools becomes crucial as our
    work environment evolves, especially when remote and asynchronous work environments
    are becoming the norm. Personal spaces in Confluence are instrumental in facilitating

    as pillars of support for teams navigating through remote and asynchronous work
    challenges. Personal spaces can significantly build a robust, transparent, and
    seamless workflow, which we’ll explore in this chapter. Let’s dive deeper and

    crucial before implementing them effectively. Let’s take a deeper look into what
    personal spaces are.

- en: A personal space in Confluence is a space that is created by an individual user
    for their own use. It is a private space where a user can create, manage, and
    store their own pages and documents. The personal space is a great way to organize
    your own work, take notes, and create drafts of documents before sharing them
    with others. It is also a good place to store documents and information that is
    not yet ready for public consumption or that you want to keep private.

    with others.

    why one needs such a space while working remotely; the answer is simple: to enhance
    organization, manage personal projects, and streamline workflows. For example,
    you’re a project manager developing a new product strategy. Your personal space
    can be the breeding ground for your nascent ideas, drafts, project timelines,

    of keeping all this information scattered across different platforms or documents,
    you can create a personal space in Confluence and organize all this information
    in one place. You can create pages for meeting notes, a page for tasks, and pages
    for different documents. You can work on them privately, and once you are ready,
    you can share them with your team or move them to a project space in Confluence.

    of your personality, reflecting your work style. You can enrich your personal
    spaces with pages, blogs, tasks, and attachments. Suppose you’re a graphic designer
    working on a new logo design. Your personal space can house your rough sketches,
    color palettes, font choices, and perhaps even a blog about your design journey.
    It can be your creative hub within Confluence.

    resources, meeting notes, or personal reminders. With the right mix of content,
    your personal space can transform into a comprehensive work and learning place.
    Confluence creates a simple home page for you when you create a new personal space.
    You can use it as a starting point and develop it according to your needs. We
    recommend you meticulously design your personal space’s home page.

    maintenance. Since regular decluttering and organizing are essential practices
    in Confluence, you must keep your personal space up to date and organized as the
    owner. Maintenance also extends to the timely archiving of obsolete content and
    the effective use of labels for easy retrieval. A well-maintained personal space
    enhances productivity and saves valuable time in searching through disorganized
    content.

    It’s wise to think twice before hitting delete.

    Confluence. This setting is done from the **Global permissions** section, as seen
    in the following screenshot. Remember that you need to be a Confluence administrator
    to access these settings. To edit **Global permissions**, click the gear icon
    in the top nav bar to view your site’s settings.

    has personal space permission, meaning Confluence will automatically create a
    personal space for users added to this group. Also, the individuals in this group
    can create a new personal space if they don’t already have one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    platform. Disabling this feature won’t eliminate current spaces. Instead, it stops
    new spaces from being generated for users who are added to this group following
    the adjustment.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    created for that user. This feature did not exist in the past; personal spaces
    had to be created manually. Therefore, if you’ve been using Confluence for a long
    time, personal spaces might not have been created for people you added to Confluence
    a long time ago. In this case, you can create a personal space for these individuals,
    as seen in the next screenshot.

    might prefer to archive it instead. This way, you can clean up your Confluence
    environment while accessing the space’s contents when necessary.

    doesn’t. In other words, managing permissions in Confluence is about setting the
    right balance between privacy and collaboration. Choosing appropriate permission
    levels will help achieve this balance.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Communication is often challenging in remote and asynchronous work environments
    where team members are spread across different time zones. In this case, Confluence
    personal spaces can help you store and share updates, progress reports, and more,
    ensuring everyone stays in the loop, no matter when teammates log in. For instance,
    say you are a content writer based in New York and work with an editor in Sydney.
    Your personal space can serve as a real-time update system. You can keep drafts,
    edited copies, final versions, comments, and revisions in one place, accessible
    to your editor at their convenience.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another challenge in communication could be delays in feedback or approvals.
    Personal spaces can help store queries, feedback requests, and more, accessible
    for team members to see when they are online. Brainstorming in a remote setup
    can also be challenging, as impromptu meeting-room discussions are off the table.
    Personal spaces can be a mini brainstorming hub where teammates discuss and iterate
    ideas asynchronously.

    face. Here, personal spaces, learning materials, training schedules, FAQs, and

    styles can be challenging in a remote setup. However, by sharing and collaborating
    on personal spaces, team members can learn more about each other’s work processes,
    styles, and even quirks. This will contribute to building a stronger bond among
    teammates.
