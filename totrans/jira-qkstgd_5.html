                    <h1 class="header-title">Jira Schemes and Configuring Project Workflow</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we will begin customizing Jira. Thus far, we have covered the basic functionality of the tool and have gone through the unique features of Jira Core, Jira Software, and Jira Service Desk. Learning how to customize Jira will help you tweak it for your own specific requirements.</p>
<p>We will begin with understanding the concept of Jira schemes and then we will learn how to customize a workflow in our project.</p>
<p>Topics covered in this chapter include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>The various types of user in Jira</li>
<li>An overview of various schemes in Jira</li>
<li>Customizing Jira workflow</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">The various types of user in Jira</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>At the beginning of the book, we created a new Jira instance, where we created new projects and also worked on those projects to understand the features. We were able to do that only because we also have the full admin rights on our instance. In Jira, however, not everyone can be an administrator.</p>
<p>Primarily, there are three types of users in Jira, and these are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>User</li>
<li>Project administrator</li>
<li>Jira administrator</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">User</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Anyone who can log in to Jira is a user and, in most cases, a user will consume a Jira license as well, except in Jira Service Desk, where customers don't count toward the license.</p>
<p>A user is typically your developers or testers in the development team, and an agent in the service desk team. In most cases, users will work on their issues and tasks. More permissions can, however, be assigned to a user.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Project administrator</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Project administrators are usually managers or leads. They are responsible for the whole project. They are quite similar to users, but usually have more rights in relation to the project. For instance, they can add people to a project, manage project milestones, and they have more authority as regards actual issues.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Jira administrator</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Apart from users and project administrators, Jira administrators have the authority to manage your Jira instance. They can create projects, users, customize project workflows, add more custom fields, and are also responsible for the performance of the whole instance.</p>
<p>Jira administrators usually receive requests from other people to customize their projects. Ideally, you should not give this permission to many people in your team. Only a few people should have responsibility for managing your instance.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Overview of various schemes in Jira</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you create a project in Jira, the first thing that you do is create some issues under it. When the issues are created, you may want to assign it to someone. The person who is supposed to work on the issue will then start working on the issue and will eventually resolve it. It is a very simple example of the life cycle of the issue in Jira, but there are many things happening in the background.</p>
<p>The way you work on the project, the kinds of issue you create, the fields you capture in the issue, and its life cycle stages and behavior, are defined by various schemes in a Jira project.</p>
<p>The project that we created earlier in this book involved utilizing the default template that comes with Jira. The default templates are nothing but a collection or set of various schemes. These templates help us to get started with Jira very quickly and, based on your development methodology, you can choose from various types of templates that are based on standard practices observed in the industry.</p>
<p>However, every team is different, and they may have their own expectations from a Jira project. Further customization can be done either on a project-by-project basis, or according to a set of projects using the same set of schemes, prior to modifying them. Let's quickly understand the purpose of the various schemes in Jira.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Issue type schemes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In Jira, we can have different issue types, such as Epic, Story, Task, and Bug. You can always create more issue types if you want. Issue type schemes define which issue types will be available within a particular project.</p>
<p>A typical scrum-based project in Jira software would have Story, Bug, Epic, Task, and Sub-task, which is defined by the issue type scheme used in the project. One scheme can always be shared by other projects in Jira.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Workflow schemes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Workflow defines the life cycle of an issue in Jira. Within a project, you can have one workflow for all the issue types or separate workflows for each one of them. If you are using Jira Core with issue types such as Task and Sub-task, then creating a single workflow with three statues: Open, In Progress and Closed—would work, but, for a software development project, you may want to have separate workflows for Bug and Story.</p>
<p>Workflow schemes define which workflow will be used by which issue type in the project. The following table provides you with some examples of workflow schemes:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse;width: 100%">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Project</strong></td>
<td><strong>Issue types</strong></td>
<td><strong>Workflows</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Legal project</td>
<td>
<p class="mce-root">Task</p>
<p>Contract</p>
</td>
<td>Legal workflow (Task and Contract)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Software project</td>
<td>
<p class="mce-root">Epic</p>
<p>Story</p>
<p>Bug</p>
<p>Task</p>
</td>
<td>
<p class="mce-root">Agile Workflow (Epic and Story)</p>
<p>Defect Workflow (Bug and Task)</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>When new workflows are created, you can attach them to an existing issue type in the same workflow scheme used in the project. For example, in our preceding software project, if, in future, a third workflow is needed for Epic, it can be done by simply modifying an existing workflow scheme.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Issue type screen schemes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you create issues in Jira, the pop-up window where you fill in the details is nothing but a screen. It is a collection of fields. You would normally use screens to add/remove fields.</p>
<p>In Jira, screens are associated with three operations: create, edit, and view.</p>
<p>Different screens can be used when you create an issue, when you edit it, and when you are looking at the issue.</p>
<p>A screen scheme defines the mapping of the screen and an operation.</p>
<p>The issue type screen scheme defines the mapping of the screen scheme and an issue type.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Field configuration schemes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>When you create an issue in your project, you may have already noticed that some fields are mandatory, especially project, issue type, and summary, but if you want to make other fields mandatory as well, then you need to do that using field configurations. The other purpose of field configurations is to also hide certain fields completely.</p>
<p>The behavior of the field that you define—Required/Hidden is also mapped to the issue type. For instance, a field such as Due Date can be made mandatory for Bug, but not an Epic in the same project. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Permission schemes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once you have access to the project, then everything that you can do within that project is defined by the permission scheme configured for that project. There are various permissions related to who creates issues, edits issues, closes issues, adds a comment, adds attachments, and much more.</p>
<p>When a new project is created, it comes with a default permission scheme that can be modified further if required. The individual permissions within a scheme can be given to an individual, project role, or a group of users in Jira.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Notification schemes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Jira can send email alerts to various people regarding different events. When the new issue is created, an email can be sent to the reporter of the issues. There are various events related to the issue and the workflow transitions. These notifications are configured for a variety of such events and can be modified if you don't want to receive lots of emails from the system.</p>
<p>Now that we know the purpose of various schemes, let's now modify the software project that we created earlier and create a new workflow. </p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Customizing Jira workflow</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In <a href="a833f753-0310-4b30-8097-f5238af90724.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Using Jira Software for Development Teams</em>, we created a Jira software project and familiarized ourselves with its various functionalities. We created a sample scrum project that comes with predefined configurations and schemes for scrum-based methodologies.</p>
<p>Open Sample Scrum Project and go to Project settings | Workflows.</p>
<p>You will notice that there is a workflow scheme with one workflow already in that project used by all the available issue types. In the following screen, if you click on the diagram link, you will then be able to look at the workflow associated with the project:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/572fceaf-9b8a-464c-a186-33e5ddd9e3b2.png" style="width:35.67em;height:17.50em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 1</p>
<p>As you can see on the following screen, the workflow has three states: TO DO, DONE, and IN PROGRESS. The All sign signifies that you can go to any state directly; in other words, you don't have to follow a specific path in order to resolve the issue:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7ecc5f6e-5fd6-4037-a738-b4f5a939a8af.png" style="width:34.75em;height:18.58em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<div><p>The preceding workflow is already working well, but we want to create our own workflow, similar to this one, but with a few specific requirements, as mentioned in the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add a new state: ON HOLD.</li>
<li>The issue cannot be sent to DONE directly. It has to go through the IN PROGRESS status first.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram represents the workflow that we will be creating and using in our project for the Bug issue type only:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/012c626b-01d5-49db-9a52-762480ebf88a.png" style="width:16.92em;height:9.67em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 3</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">New status</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="mce-root">In the proposed new workflow, there is a new status called ON HOLD, which we first need to create in our Jira instance.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Go to Jira settings | Issues | Statuses (under ISSUE ATTRIBUTES) and click on the Add status button in the top-right corner.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Enter <kbd>On Hold</kbd> under Name, and <kbd>Issue is on hold</kbd> under Description, and then click on the Add button to create a new status, demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/43e525ad-7779-4c44-ba22-e6d18a266aba.png" style="width:35.50em;height:36.33em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 4</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a new workflow</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's now create our new workflow.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Go to Jira settings | Issues | Workflows (Under WORKFLOWS) and click on the Add workflow button in the top-right corner and enter the Name as <kbd>Bug workflow</kbd>, <kbd>This is the Bug workflow</kbd> under Description, and then click on the Add button, as demonstrated in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/0b1cf8b1-9866-4111-8174-3ad1002affce.png" style="width:24.58em;height:16.92em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>On the next screen, you will be presented with the options to edit the workflow. There are two modes to edit the workflow—Diagram and Text, both the modes will more or less let you do the same thing with few options available to each mode but we will be using the Diagram mode to create our workflow. </p>
<p>Click on the Add status option on the left-hand side and add the TO DO, IN PROGRESS, ON HOLD, and DONE statuses in your workflow, demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/370e8cb5-1510-45ef-ac1e-9d7b6ce556a5.png" style="width:30.42em;height:23.83em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>The statues will now be added to your workflow. We have made some progress, but we still need to do a few more things, primarily, removing unwanted statuses, adding transitions, and changing the Create transition to start from TO DO instead of OPEN state, this will ensure that the first state in the workflow is TO DO.</p>
<p>Click on Create transition and change it to begin with from the OPEN status to the TO DO status instead by simply dragging the arrow and dropping it on TO DO, demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/e1075ba6-33fb-4a40-ba91-c4dc1b49aa1e.png" style="width:43.92em;height:32.25em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 7</p>
<p>Now click on the OPEN status and, in the pop-up window, click on the Remove status link, as shown in the preceding screenshot. Finally, click on the Remove button in the Confirm Remove Status dialog box.</p>
<p>We now have the necessary statuses in our workflow. We need to create a transition between those statuses as per the requirements of our workflow.</p>
<p>First, click on the TO DO status, drag a line from this status to the IN PROGRESS status. A pop-up window called Add Transition will appear, shown as follows, where you will be asked to enter the Name of the transitions, which could be the same as your destination status or any name of your choosing:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/f0f3a6ef-22e3-46ac-9525-bb1f76bfa8ee.png" style="width:28.17em;height:34.67em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 8</p>
<p>Remember that this transition name will appear to the end user when they work on the Jira issue. Click on the Add button to add a new transition.</p>
<p>The moment you add the transition, a line with an arrow representing a transition will be created between these two statues. The direction of the arrow is also important here. To add a transition back from IN PROGRESS to TO DO, you need to add one more transition, demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/6d83248a-e0f3-4050-af1e-2afe1f4cc3e3.png" style="width:25.33em;height:20.83em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 9</p>
<p>Now, refer to our proposed workflow in the preceding diagram and create the remainder of the transitions. Your final workflow should look something like the following diagram:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/0a959775-2e44-4f47-9359-e856abdb3b5f.png" style="width:24.67em;height:17.67em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 10</p>
<p>Our workflow is ready and all we need to do is use it in our project. We have just learned how to create a workflow, which is great, but there are lots of other customizations that can be done using workflow configurations, such as adding conditions and validators to our transitions.</p>
<p>Let's now go back to our project and use this workflow.</p>
<p>Go to Project settings | Workflows and then click on the Add Workflow button in the top-left corner, demonstrated as follows, and then click on the Add Existing option:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/fd0b41e8-41cf-45f2-9770-d10d34523898.png" style="width:41.08em;height:19.42em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 11</p>
<p>In the Add Existing Workflow popup, find the Bug workflow that you just created and click on the Next button, as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/76f2abbf-6b83-4235-8127-2c784d4eb3b5.png" style="width:42.92em;height:36.25em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 12</p>
<p>Then, in the Assign Issue Types to "Bug workflow" popup, select Bug and click on the Finish button, demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/a1197b12-7318-4bca-bfbf-e08c81b5df16.png" style="width:29.92em;height:29.58em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 13</p>
<p>Finally, click on the Publish button at the top, demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/dc7b6a6d-ab8b-409e-98ac-f68895c45169.png" style="width:41.83em;height:10.83em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 14</p>
<p>In the next set of screens, you may need to Associate any existing issue with the new workflow. Just follow the process and you will then have a new workflow in your existing workflow scheme for your project, shown as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d8a059f8-751c-48e4-a597-87bb70a842eb.png" style="width:30.42em;height:18.42em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 15</p>
<p>You can now see this new Bug workflow in action when you work on the bugs in your project. Just create a new issue of type bug in your project and you will notice that you now have a new workflow with custom transitions and statuses, demonstrated as follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7d761c02-b720-43db-a75c-4deed1d12414.png" style="width:12.75em;height:18.83em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 16</p>
<p>By way of good practice, always check whether the new workflow is behaving as you expected.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Congratulations! You have now successfully started your journey of customizing Jira by creating your own workflow. In this chapter, we learned a lot, starting with an overview of various types of users in Jira and then we spent lot of time going through the process of creating a custom workflow and also using it in our existing project.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will continue customizing Jira further and take a look at how we can add more fields to our project by using screens and making sure that those new fields are visible only on a specific type of issue. We will also take a look at various permissions and learn how to modify them.</p>
