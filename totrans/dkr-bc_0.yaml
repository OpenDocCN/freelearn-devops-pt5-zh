- en: It's not very often a technology comes along, which is adopted so widely across
    an entire industry. Since its first public release in March 2013, Docker has not
    only gained the support of both end users, like you and I, but also industry leaders
    such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google.

    development and IT operations teams for several years to have a tool, which can
    ensure that an application can consistently work across all stages of an application
    lifecycle, from development all the way through to production.

    Applications Using Docker*, uses the Docker installation we installed in the previous
    chapter and launches containers. By the end of the chapter, we will launch a WordPress
    installation both manually and by using Docker Compose to define your multi-container
    application. We will also look at how you can publish your own images to Docker
    Hub.'

    explains how to move away from your local installation of Docker and into public
    clouds. Here, we will look at launching Docker hosts in various public clouds
    and also deploy our applications onto them.'

- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Docker Swarm"), *Docker Swarm*, continues
    to use public clouds; but rather than working with single isolated Docker hosts,

    and Monitoring*, questions that, now that we have containers running locally,
    remotely, and within a cluster, what can go wrong? In this chapter, we will look
    at some of the problems you can come across. Also, we will learn how we can deploy
    tools to get metrics such as CPU, memory, and HDD utilization from your containers
    using both, first and third-party tools.'

    Together*, emphasizes that you should now have a good understanding of what Docker
    is, how it works, and some possible use cases. In this chapter, we will explore
    how you can share container experience with colleagues as well what steps to take
    next.'
