<p class="calibre3">In the previous chapters, we looked at how to use Jira to run and manage projects with both Scrum and Kanban, as well as customizing Jira itself to be more flexible and adaptable to your needs. In this chapter, we will look into some of the additional capabilities of Jira, as well as integrating with other systems to provide a complete end-to-end experience for you and your team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of the chapter, you will have learned how to:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Display and share project information with the dashboard</li>
<li class="calibre9">Create and link epics to requirement pages</li>
<li class="calibre9">Create user stories from requirement pages</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Displaying agile reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As we saw in <a href="part0033.html#VF2I0-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre11">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre2">Jira Software for Scrum</em> and <a href="part0057.html#1MBG20-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre11">Chapter 3</a>, <em class="calibre2">Jira Software for Kanban</em>, Jira comes with a number of reports that you can generate to get a better understanding of how your project is tracking. However, they often require you to go to your board and then generate the report manually. A better way to display and share information on your project is to take advantage of some of Jira's built-in collaboration features.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Using the Jira dashboard</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The easiest way to display and share your project and sprint progress with everyone is to use the dashboard feature from Jira. A dashboard acts as a portal page for your project, and you can display different information about your project by adding gadgets onto the dashboard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Jira comes with a number of gadgets that are designed specifically to display agile related information, including:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Sprint burndown gadget</strong>: This displays a burndown chart of your sprint on the dashboard. The chart will be automatically updated to reflect the current data.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Days remaining in sprint gadget</strong>: This displays how many days are left before the sprint is scheduled to be completed. It acts as a reminder for how much time is left on the clock.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Sprint health gadget</strong>: This displays a bar chart showing information on how the sprint is progressing; for example, how much more work is still left to do.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">The power of using the Jira dashboard is that you are not limited to using only the gadgets that are specifically designed for Agile. Jira comes with many other useful gadgets that you can use to drill down into your project and sprint. They are as follows:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Filter results gadget</strong>: You can select a filter and display the result in a table. You can use this to display the most important issues in the sprint.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Two-dimensional filter statistics gadget</strong>: This is similar to the filter results gadget, but instead of displaying a list of issues, it will display a statistical breakdown of the filter result based on the fields you choose.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Pie chart gadget</strong>: You can select a filter and the result will be displayed as a pie chart, where each slice is based on a field of your choice; for example, priority.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">As you can see, you can build a very useful dashboard by combining gadgets from both agile and non-agile based ones. You can even create your own gadget or download gadgets from third-party vendors to display information specific to your needs.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To create a dashboard for your project and sprint, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Select the Manage Dashboards option from the Dashboards menu.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Create new dashboard button.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Enter a name for your new dashboard.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="4" class="calibre14">
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Select how you want to share the dashboard. Dashboards are private by default, so for others to see the dashboard, you must share the dashboard with them. As shown in the following screenshot, we are sharing the dashboard with members of the Top Secret Project.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to create the dashboard:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone93" src="img/00103.jpeg"/></div>
<p>Make sure you click the Add button after you have selected who to share the dashboard with.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have created a new dashboard, you can start adding contents onto it with gadgets:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Add a new gadget link. It does not matter which one you click, as you can always reposition the gadgets after they have been added, by simply dragging them around on the dashboard.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the gadgets you want to add from the Add a gadget dialog by clicking on its Add gadget button.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Close the dialog once you have added all the gadgets you want:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone94" src="img/00104.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have added the gadgets, you will need to configure each gadget to display the data you want. For most gadgets, all you need to do is select the board, sprint, project, or filter to use:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone95" src="img/00105.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You can also configure the layout of the dashboard. By default, the dashboard is divided into two columns of equal width. You can change that by clicking on the Edit Layout button and then selecting the layout you want.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Using the wallboard</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Another great Jira feature you can take advantage of is the wallboard. You can think of wallboards as Jira dashboards that you display on a big wall using a projector, or with a big monitor.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Using a wallboard is a great way to share information about your project with your team and other colleagues. The following screenshot shows an example of a wallboard. By taking the data out of an agile project, and projecting that onto a big screen, everyone will have instant and easy access to the information they need. As people walk by your team's work area, they will get a good idea of how the team is progressing:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone96" src="img/00106.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">To set up a wallboard for your agile project, you will first need to create a dashboard. Note that not all gadgets are wallboard-compatible, but all the agile gadgets that come out of the box are compatible. Once you have your dashboard ready, click on the Tools menu and select the View as Wallboard option, link it up to a big monitor, and you have yourself an awesome wallboard.</p>
<p class="calibre3">If you have multiple dashboards, you can create a slideshow of wallboards. All you have to do is select the Setup Wallboard Slideshow option from the Tools menu, as shown in the following screenshot, to set up the slideshow. Select the dashboards to include on the wall, and how you would like the slideshow to look like(Display Options), and use the View as Wallboard Slideshow option to display it:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Integrating Jira with Confluence</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Confluence is a team collaboration solution from Atlassian (the maker of Jira) that enables teams to collaborate and create content together. Organizations often use it to create and share information related to projects, such as functional and design specifications. Jira works seamlessly with Confluence to provide you with a complete agile experience. In the following sections, we will look at how you can integrate Jira with Confluence to:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Create epics and user stories with design documentation</li>
<li class="calibre9">Manage and view your sprints on a calendar</li>
<li class="calibre9">Capture meeting notes for your sprint planning sessions</li>
<li class="calibre9">Create retrospective reports at the end of each sprint</li>
<li class="calibre9">Share and publish release information</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Setting up an application link with Confluence</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you have not already integrated Jira and Confluence together, you need to create a new application link. To create an application link with Confluence, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Jira administration console.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the Applications tab and then the Application links option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Enter the URL to your Confluence instance and click on the Create new link button, as shown in the next screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone98" src="img/00108.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre14">
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Tick the The servers have the same set of users and usernames option if both Jira and Confluence share the same user repository; for example, LDAP.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have a common user repository for both applications, such as LDAP, by enabling this option, users will have a seamless experience. Otherwise, they will be prompted to authorize access for the first-time viewing of contents from the other application.</p>
<ol start="5" class="calibre14">
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Tick the I am an administrator on both instances option if you have an administrator account on both Jira and Confluence. This will let you also create a reciprocal link from Confluence to Jira.</li>

<ol start="6" class="calibre14">
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on the Continue button:</li>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating Confluence pages from epics</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Jira is a great tool to track and manage your day-to-day activities for your project, but it is not the best tool to capture detailed information for your tasks, such as design documentation and functional specifications for your epics. With Confluence as a documentation platform, there are a few ways you can create design documents and link them to your epics.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first option is to create your documents called Confluence pages, directly from your agile board's backlog:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to your agile board and go to its backlog.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Open up the Epics panel from the left-hand side.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select and expand the epic you want to create a Confluence page for.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Click on the Links pages link from the epic.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="5" class="calibre14">
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click on the Create page button from the dialog, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone102" src="img/00112.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="6" class="calibre14">
<li value="6" class="calibre9">After you click on the Create page button, you will be taken to Confluence in a new browser tab with the Create dialog displayed, as shown in the following screenshot. By default, the dialog will have the Project requirements template (also called a blueprint) preselected for you, but you can choose to use a different template if you want. Also note that the Select space field at the top will have the last Confluence space you have visited preselected, so make sure you select the correct space to create your new page in.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="7" class="calibre14">
<li value="7" class="calibre9">Click on the Create button after you have selected the correct space to create your new page in:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone103" src="img/00113.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="8" class="calibre14">
<li value="8" class="calibre9">If this is the first time you have used the product requirements template, you will get a Let's get started information dialog, as seen in the following screenshot. Simply tick the Don't show this again option at the bottom and click on the Create button to create your new page:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone104" src="img/00114.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="9" class="calibre14">
<li value="9" class="calibre9">Click on the Create button again to start working on the new page.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Confluence will present you with a new page and editor, with a predefined template. You can simply fill in the templates with information such as goals and requirements. A few important things to note:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Make sure you give your page a title. A good practice is to name it after the linked epic.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Reference the epic in Jira by clicking on the Link to related Jira epic of feature text label from the Epic field. This way, a reference link will be created between the requirement page and the epic issue.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">With the page created, if you go back to Jira, the Linked pages link for the epic will change to 1 linked page, and clicking on that will show you the actual linked page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone105" src="img/00115.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">If you already have requirement pages created for the project, instead of creating new ones from the epics, you can simply link to those pages by clicking on the Link page button. After clicking on it, you will get a search box, and you can type in your page's title, find the page you want, and select it to create a link. This is illustrated in the next screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone106" src="img/00116.jpeg"/></div>
<p>If you cannot see the linked pages, make sure Confluence has the remote API enabled. See <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/vEsC" class="calibre21">https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/vEsC</a> for more details.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating user stories from Confluence</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">If you are using the product requirements blueprint, as we have seen earlier, there is a section on the page for you to list out all the requirements for the feature. Once you have defined all the requirements with the team, you can create user stories directly on the page. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Go to your product requirements page in Confluence.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Highlight the text of the requirement you want to create a user story with. The text you highlight will become the summary of the user story, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone107" src="img/00117.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="3" class="calibre14">
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click the Jira icon. This will open up the Create Issue dialog, as shown in the following screenshot.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Make sure the project and issue type selection is correct. You can click on the Edit link to change that.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Enter a description for the user story.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">If the Product Requirements page is already linked to an epic in Jira, you will see a Link to epic option. Uncheck this option if you do not want the user story to be added to the epic.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="7" class="calibre14">
<li value="7" class="calibre9">Click on the Create button to create the user story:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone108" src="img/00118.jpeg"/></div>
<p>If you have multiple requirements listed in the Requirements table on your page, you can click on the Create x issues from this table option at the bottom, and Confluence will automatically create a user story for each requirement you have.</p>
<p class="calibre3">After you have created the user stories, you will see a Jira issue added next to each of the requirements, showing their key and status. Their status will be automatically updated as the issues are being worked on. You will also see a Jira links button at the top of the page next to the breadcrumbs. Clicking on that will display all the Jira issues currently linked to this page, including any epics and user stories. Refer to the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone109" src="img/00119.jpeg"/></div>
<p>Currently, the Jira links button is only available if you use the default theme in Confluence.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Planning your sprints with team calendars</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As you and your team work on the sprint, it is often helpful to see how your sprints fit in with other activities your team might have: for example, if there are team members going on a vacation or with travel plans halfway through a sprint, or if there are other delivery commitments that might interfere with the sprint.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The key to solving this is to have all this information visually displayed on a single calendar, viewable and shared by the entire team, so everyone can stay well-informed, just like having tasks plotted on an agile board. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to your team's Team Calendar.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Add Event button.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select the Jira Agile Sprints option for Event Type:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone110" src="img/00120.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre14">
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Select the project that belongs to your Scrum board.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Enter a name for the event.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on the OK button to create the event.</li>
</ol>
<p>Team Calendars for Confluence is a separate product you can get for Confluence from Atlassian Marketplace at <a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.extra.team-calendars/cloud/overview" class="calibre21">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.atlassian.confluence.extra.team-calendars/cloud/overview</a></p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have created the event, Team Calendar will get all the sprints you have for the selected project, and display them on the calendar. As shown in the following screenshot, we have two sprints, Sprint 2 and Sprint 3. We can also see that Tom Johnson will be away at the start of Sprint 2, which might have an impact on the team's ability to complete everything in the sprint on time. Also, if you have all team members' vacation plans on the calendar, then during your sprint planning sessions, you will have all the information you need when deciding how much work should go into the sprint and how long the sprint should be:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone111" src="img/00121.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">With the calendar all set up, you can also share and embed it. A good way to use this feature is to create a new Confluence page in the same project space where you have all your requirements documentation, call it something like Project Calendar, and then embed the calendar into the page. To embed the calendar into a page:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Create button at the top of the page.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the project space for the Select space field.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Now select the Blank page option and click on the Create button.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Name the page Project Calendar.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Select and add the Team Calendar macro into the page.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on the Add Existing Calendar option.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre9">Search for the calendar you have created, and click on the Add button.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="8" class="calibre14">
<li value="8" class="calibre9">Click on the Save button to create the page:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone112" src="img/00122.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After you have created the page, you will have all the information about the project in a single place along with the Confluence space for the project, for easy access. One additional step you can take is to create a quick shortcut link on your Scrum board to the Project Calendar page, so it is just a click away when you need it.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To create a link to the page:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to your Scrum board.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Add link option from the left-hand side.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Enter the URL for the Project Calendar page.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Enter a label for the link; that is, Project Calendar.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to create the link.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">The link will be displayed under the Project Shortcuts section on the left-hand side, as shown in the following screenshot. So during your sprint planning sessions, or work sessions on the active sprint, you can easily access Project Calendar and get the most up-to-date information:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone113" src="img/00123.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Capturing sprint meeting notes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As we have seen, you can plan and visualize your sprints with Confluence's Team Calendar. Another important part of your sprint planning session is to keep records of the meetings, capturing what was discussed, decisions made, and being able to reference back to those meeting notes in the context of your sprints.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Just like requirement documents, Confluence is also a great place to capture and store this information. From inside your Scrum board, you can create and link each sprint to pages in Confluence, just like with epics. To create a meeting note for a sprint:</p>

<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to your Scrum board.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on Backlog on the left-hand side to display all your sprints.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click on the Linked pages link for the sprint that you want to create a meeting note for.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="4" class="calibre14">
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Click on the Create page button if you want to create a new meeting note page, or the Link page button if you already have the meeting note ready:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone114" src="img/00124.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">If you click on the Create page button, you will be taken to Confluence, with the Create dialog showing. It will have the Meeting notes blueprint preselected. Make sure the correct space is selected and click on the Create button; you will be able to start entering your meeting information. Once you have created and saved the meeting note, the page will have a Jira link referencing the sprint it has been created for, as shown in the following screenshot, and the sprint will also list all the meeting notes it has:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating retrospective reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Other than creating meeting notes, another great feature is being able to create retrospective sprint reports at the end of each sprint. Remember, one of the key ideas behind agile is continuous improvement, so it is important that at the end of each sprint, the entire team comes together and discusses what the they did well, and what went wrong during the sprint; and also to summarize lessons learned and discuss how to improve the process in the next sprint as a team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To create a retrospective report for your sprint, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to your Scrum board.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on Reports from the left-hand side.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select the sprint to be reported on and select Sprint Report.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Click on the Linked pages link.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click on the Create page button:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone116" src="img/00126.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="6" class="calibre14">
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on the Next button in the Confluence Create dialog.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre9">Enter a title for the report or leave the default.</li>
<li value="8" class="calibre9">Add all the team members present in the retrospective meeting.</li>
<li value="9" class="calibre9">Click on the Create button to start work on the report.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Just like all other reports created, a reference link will be created between the report and the sprint, so you can easily go back and forth between the two.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Displaying your project in Confluence</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The last integration feature between Jira and Confluence is to create reports on the project based on specific versions. There are two types of reports you can create:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Change log report</strong>: The change log report lists out all the issues that are part of a selected version. This saves you the hassle of manually compiling a list of issues and entering them. This is a great way to communicate changes within a given version to your customers and other stakeholders.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Status report</strong>: The status report is a live report that shows the status of the project in a number of pie charts.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">To create these reports, you will start in Confluence instead of Jira:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Log into Confluence and browse to your project space.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Create button at the top or press the <em class="calibre2">C</em> key on your keyboard.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select Jira Report from the Create dialog and click on Create.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Choose the report you want to create and click the Next button. In our example, we are creating a status report:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone117" src="img/00127.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="5" class="calibre14">
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Select the project and version to report on. These fields are autopopulated based on data coming from Jira.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Enter a title for the report.</li>
<li value="7" class="calibre9">Click on the Create button to start work on the report.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">The default report template will be autopopulated based on the information you have provided, so you can simply click on the Save button to create the report without any further changes. The following screenshot shows a default status report:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone118" src="img/00128.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Working with Jira agile boards offline</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Jira brings the power of agile to a web-based system where progress and reports can be accessed and shared with everyone, even if they aren't physically colocated together. However, sometimes it is still useful to have a physical board and cards so meetings such as daily stand-ups can feel more interactive and refreshing, rather than having everyone stare at a computer monitor all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">This can be done with a third-party add-on called Agile Cards - printing issues from Jira. You can search and install it from the <strong class="calibre1">Universal Plugin Manager</strong> (<strong class="calibre1">UPM</strong>), or download it from the following link, and upload it to Jira via the UPM manually:</p>
<p class="calibre3"><a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.spartez.scrumprint.scrumplugin" class="calibre11">https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/com.spartez.scrumprint.scrumplugin</a></p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have installed the Agile Cards add-on, you will see a new print icon added to your boards. The following screenshot shows the new icon in the Backlog view of a Scrum board. The icon is also available in the Active sprints mode and on the Kanban board:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone119" src="img/00129.jpeg"/></div>
<p>The <kbd class="calibre28">print</kbd> function is also available outside of Jira; for example, when you run a search in Issue Navigator, or when viewing individual issues.</p>
<p class="calibre3">When you click on the print icon, a new tab will be opened, and each issue will be turned into a card, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone120" src="img/00130.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">After you have printed your Agile Cards, you can cut them up and pin them onto your physical board, and use them in your team meetings. The second feature of this add-on is that it also allows you to synchronize your physical board with your agile board, by letting you take a photo of your board, and then import that back into Jira.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In order to transfer contents from your physical board to Jira's agile board, we need to add a new piece of information to your physical board, called a <strong class="calibre1">splitter</strong>. A splitter is a piece of paper you need to place between each column on your physical board, so when you take a photo of your physical board, Agile Cards will be able to work out how the columns match up with Jira's agile board. To generate splitters for your board:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the agile board you want to synchronize with.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the new Agile Cards menu and then the Synchronize physical task board option.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="3" class="calibre14">
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click the Physical board setup tab if this is the first time you are synchronizing both boards:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone120" src="img/00131.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre14">
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Drag all the columns from the left-hand side that have a corresponding column on your physical board to the Physical board layout section.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click the Print splitters button to print out splitters.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="6" class="calibre14">
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Pin the splitter images onto your physical board, as shown in the following image. This will help Agile Cards to determine which column each card belongs to:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone121" src="img/00132.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">With your physical board all set up with splitters, you can now synchronize with your Jira agile board:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Take a photo off your board, and send it to your computer.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Go to the agile board you want to synchronize with.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select the new Agile Cards menu and then the Synchronize physical task board option.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Click the Board synchronization tab.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3"> </p>
<ol start="5" class="calibre14">
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Select and upload the photo taken from Step 1. If the photo is processed successfully, you will get a summary of all the changes.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Review the result and click on the automatically change status link to update all issues, or the bulk edit links for each column and process them individually.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Agile Cards has several other customization options, such as letting you customize the layout of your card so you can decide what fields will be included in the printout.

<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we looked at some of the additional features and capabilities Jira offers, so you can now create your Scrum and Kanban boards just the way you want them. We looked at using some of the non-agile specific features of Jira, such as gadgets and dashboards to better surface data and help with collaboration. We looked at integrating Jira with Confluence and Team Calendars, so you can create detailed documentations and report and cross-reference them with epics, user stories, and sprints.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Remember, a bit part of these features is to take the data out of Jira so it is not in a silo, and share the information with the team and other stakeholders of your projects. By sharing information on a dashboard, and retrospectively reviewing your progress as a team, you can contiguously refine and improve together, and become successful at using agile and being agile.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In the next chapter, we will look at integrating Jira with Atlassian Bitbucket, another solution from Atlassian that focuses on helping software engineers manage, build, and deploy code. Together with Jira, this will complete the cycle of using Jira Software as an agile project management solution for software development.</p>
