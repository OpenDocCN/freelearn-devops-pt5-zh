    can customize the look and feel of Confluence, add a structure, create content,
    and how we can involve other people. Apart from the areas we have already covered,
    there are some other useful features worth learning.

    to Confluence, how Confluence can be integrated with different applications using
    application links and how we can troubleshoot Confluence and get in contact with
    Atlassian Support.

    without any added features or functionalities. Add-ons are separately installed
    components that supplement or enhance functionality in Confluence. This can vary
    from a single feature such as a macro to something that could be a product on
    its own, such as the add-on "Team Calendars".

    While both terms are sometimes used interchangeably, they are not the same. A
    plugin is a type of add-on that can be added to Confluence and is developed using
    the Atlassian Plugin SDK. Not all add-ons are plugins. A native app for you mobile
    device would be considered an add-on, while the "content formatting macros" are
    plugins.

    This means that some coding is involved. If this is not something you are comfortable
    with, just give the book to a developer in your company when you're finished;
    he or she might be able to help you write the add-on you need.
