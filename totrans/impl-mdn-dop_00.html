<p class="mce-root"><span>DevOps is the newest revolution in deploying software quickly and efficiently. With a set of automation tools, an orchestration platform, and a few processes, companies can speed up the release cycle of their IT systems by enabling the engineers to do more with fewer resources and become more engaged in the business process.</span></p>

<p class="mce-root">In order to follow this book and its contents, you will need a trial account on Google Cloud Platform and an editor (I used Atom but any other editor will work) as well as Node.js installed on your local machine. You will also need to install Docker locally in order to test the different examples. We will use <strong>Google Container Engine</strong> (<span><strong>GKE</strong>)</span> for the Kubernetes examples but if you want to play locally with Kubernetes, Minikube can also be used, although you need a fairly powerful computer.</p>

<p class="mce-root">In this book, you will find a number of text styles that distinguish between different kinds of information. Here are some examples of these styles and an explanation of their meaning. Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "<span>The next lines of code read the link and assign it to the</span> <kbd>BeautifulSoup</kbd> <span>function.</span>" A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>resource "google_compute_address" "my-first-ip" {<br/> name = "static-ip-address"<br/>}</pre>
<p class="mce-root">When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre>resource "google_compute_address" "my-first-ip" {<br/> <strong>name = "static-ip-address"<br/>}</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root">Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>docker commit 329b2f9332d5 my-ubuntu</strong></pre>
<p class="mce-root"><strong>New terms</strong> and <strong>important words</strong> are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "<span>In order to download new modules, we will go to</span> <span class="packt_screen">Files</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Project Name</span> <span>|</span> <span class="packt_screen">Project Interpreter</span><span>.</span>"</p>
