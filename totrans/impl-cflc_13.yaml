    is the ability to expand its capabilities quickly and reliably. You can do this
    in two ways: either integrate Confluence with other systems you use or add new
    features to Confluence. In this chapter, we will talk about these integrations
    and extension possibilities to give you an idea of Confluence’s potential in these
    areas. Some integrations in the following pages can be activated when you start
    using Confluence, while others may require effort. We can comfortably say that
    Atlassian has done its part regarding integration. As a result, you will find
    that Confluence is ready with world-standard infrastructure when you need integration.
    You may not need integration or expansion, but knowing how to do so will surely
    broaden your horizons. So, let’s examine Confluence’s integration and extension
    capabilities.'

    development is a critical decision. Organizations leveraging platforms such as
    Confluence Cloud often face the dilemma of developing applications in-house or
    outsourcing them to specialized firms such as Atlassian Solution Partners. Both
    approaches offer distinct benefits and challenges, and the choice can significantly

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Confluence Cloud is a robust platform for collaborative software solutions,
    enabling teams to work together more efficiently and creatively. However, developing
    a new application for Confluence Cloud is a multifaceted job that requires a deep
    understanding of various aspects. From aligning with Atlassian’s familiar user
    experience to ensuring optimal performance, security, and design, each element
    plays a vital role in the application’s success. Also, considerations such as
    agility, a comprehensive review of Atlassian’s roadmap, mastery of existing plugins,
    and sustainability further enrich the development process. In this section, we’ll
    concentrate on these critical considerations, providing insight and guidelines
    to navigate the complex landscape of Confluence Cloud application development.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When developing a Confluence Cloud application, it’s essential to stay aligned
    with the familiar **user experience** (**UX**) that we associate with Atlassian.
    A consistent UX ensures that users find the new application intuitive and easy
    to use, maintaining a seamless experience across the platform. It is also important
    to pay attention to layout, navigation, visual elements, and interactions. By
    adhering to Atlassian’s design guidelines and UX principles, developers can create
    an application that feels like a natural extension of the existing ecosystem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Performance optimization is another crucial aspect to consider. An application
    that takes a long time to load or becomes unresponsive can significantly affect
    user satisfaction and productivity. That’s why it’s crucial to prioritize efficient
    coding practices, optimized queries, and effective resource management. Regular
    performance testing and monitoring will also help identify bottlenecks and ensure
    the application runs smoothly, even under heavy loads or large datasets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Meanwhile, security should be a top priority. Pay attention to the best practices
    in authentication, authorization, data encryption, and secure communication. Regular
    vulnerability assessments and adherence to industry security standards will also
    help protect sensitive data and maintain users’ trust. Collaborating with security
    experts and staying updated on the latest security trends is another option to
    build a secure application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An elegant and functional design not only enhances the visual appeal but also
    contributes to the overall usability of the application. For a refined and engaging
    user interface, consider employing user-centered design principles, engaging in
    iterative design processes, and seeking user feedback. Design considerations should
    also extend to accessibility, ensuring that the application is accessible by as
    many people as possible, regardless of any disabilities or limitations they may
    have. The Agile approach to development emphasizes flexibility, collaboration,
    and responsiveness to change. Regular reviews, iterations, and close collaboration
    between stakeholders ensure that the development process aligns with the evolving
    needs of users and the organization.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When developing a new application, another point to focus on is understanding
    Atlassian’s roadmap and strategic direction to stay aligned with Atlassian’s long-term
    goals and upcoming features. By studying the roadmap, developers can avoid duplicating
    efforts and identify opportunities for integration or enhancement within the broader
    ecosystem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also, being well-versed in existing plugins is essential as another developer
    may have already created the application you plan to develop. Researching existing
    solutions, understanding the strengths and weaknesses, and identifying gaps or
    unmet needs can guide development efforts. Building on existing plugins or collaborating
    with other developers can also lead to more efficient and innovative solutions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sustainability in development is not just about the immediate product – it also
    considers the application’s long-term maintenance, scalability, and extensibility.
    Ensuring the code is well-documented, following best practices in architecture
    and development, and planning for ongoing support and updates will contribute
    to a more sustainable and resilient application.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In conclusion, developing a new Confluence Cloud application is a complex task
    that requires a thoughtful approach to various aspects, including user experience,
    performance, security, design, agility, alignment with Atlassian’s roadmap, mastery
    of existing plugins, and sustainability. By adopting a comprehensive approach
    to these elements, you can create a robust, user-friendly, and valuable addition
    to the Confluence Cloud ecosystem.
