- en: I noticed that authors sometimes thank famous people for the help they never
    received. At other times, they publish introduction written by well-established
    authors who probably didn’t even read their book. There must be a reason behind
    that. Maybe it helps to have well-known names. Perhaps listing famous people invokes
    some unknown powers. There might be a kind of a Vudu magic that binds a reader
    to the book. Even though I doubt that thanking people helps, I’ll do it anyways.
    It’s better not to risk it.

    Uncle Bob whose books are always in front of mines in Amazon; Donald Trump for
    writing entertaining tweets; Josip Broz Tito for not living over 100 years; Netflix
    for entertaining my daughter while I work; David Heinemeier Hansson for explaining
    that Ruby On Rails is untestable; Douglas Adams for letting me use his quote at
    the end of this book. There are many others I could thank, but my humility compels
    me to stop and list a few others who are not (yet) famous.'

    up every morning and do an insane number of working hours. Her smile after coming
    back from school is all the encouragement I need. To my wife Eva, without whose
    never-failing support this book would never have been finished.
