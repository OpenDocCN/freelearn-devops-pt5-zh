- en: I noticed that authors sometimes thank famous people for the help they never
    received. At other times, they publish introduction written by well-established
    authors who probably didn’t even read their book. There must be a reason behind
    that. Maybe it helps to have well-known names. Perhaps listing famous people invokes
    some unknown powers. There might be a kind of a Vudu magic that binds a reader
    to the book. Even though I doubt that thanking people helps, I’ll do it anyways.
    It’s better not to risk it.

  zh: 我注意到，作者有时会感谢那些他们从未得到过帮助的名人。有时，他们还会发布那些由声名显赫的作者撰写的介绍，而这些作者可能根本没有读过他们的书。背后一定有某种原因，也许有名的名字有助于推广。也许列出这些名人的名字能召唤一些未知的力量。可能存在一种“巫毒”魔法，使得读者与书籍产生某种联系。尽管我怀疑感谢他人会有帮助，但我还是决定这么做。最好不要冒这个风险。
- en: 'I wish to thank the following people: Larry David for being weirder than me;
    Uncle Bob whose books are always in front of mines in Amazon; Donald Trump for
    writing entertaining tweets; Josip Broz Tito for not living over 100 years; Netflix
    for entertaining my daughter while I work; David Heinemeier Hansson for explaining
    that Ruby On Rails is untestable; Douglas Adams for letting me use his quote at
    the end of this book. There are many others I could thank, but my humility compels
    me to stop and list a few others who are not (yet) famous.'

  zh: 我要感谢以下几位：Larry David，感谢他比我还怪；Uncle Bob，他的书总是在亚马逊上排在我的书前；Donald Trump，感谢他写出了娱乐性的推文；Josip
    Broz Tito，感谢他没活过100岁；Netflix，感谢它在我工作时娱乐我的女儿；David Heinemeier Hansson，感谢他解释了Ruby
    On Rails是无法测试的；Douglas Adams，感谢他允许我在本书的结尾使用他的引用。还有许多人我也想感谢，但我的谦虚让我停下了脚步，列出一些（尚未）成名的人。
- en: This book is dedicated to my daughter Sara that gives me the strength to wake
    up every morning and do an insane number of working hours. Her smile after coming
    back from school is all the encouragement I need. To my wife Eva, without whose
    never-failing support this book would never have been finished.
