			<p>Docker is a game-changer when it comes to modern applications' architecture and how they are deployed. It has now grown into a key driver of innovation beyond system administration, and it has had a significant impact on the world of web development and beyond. But how can you make sure you're keeping up with the innovations it's driving? How can you be sure you're using it to its full potential? </p>
			<p>This book shows you how; it not only demonstrates how to use Docker more effectively, it also helps you rethink and re-imagine what's possible with Docker. </p>
			<p>You will cover basic topics, such as building, managing, and storing images, along with best practices, before delving into Docker security. You'll find everything related to extending and integrating Docker in new and innovative ways. Docker Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes will help you take control of your containers in an efficient way. </p>
			<p>By the end of the book, you will have a broad and detailed understanding of exactly what's possible with Docker and how seamlessly it fits into your local workflow, highly available public cloud platforms, and other tools. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>If you are an IT professional and you recognize Docker's importance in innovation in everything from system administration to web development, but you aren't sure of how to use it to its full potential, this book is for you.</p>
