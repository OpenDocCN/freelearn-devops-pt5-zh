- en: JIRA is a popular issue tracking tool from Atlassian and has amazing customization
    abilities and finely grained control over various functions. Out of the box, JIRA
    offers issue and bug tracking capabilities to create tasks, assign them to users,
    and generate useful reports. However, the real power of JIRA lies in the customizations
    it offers.

    the JIRA installation. Then, you will be given a brief refresher of the fundamental
    concepts and understand the customizations in detail, along with sample data for
    various use cases, and several aspects of JIRA administration, such as user management,
    groups, roles, and security levels, will be covered, keeping in mind the applications
    for enterprises. Next, this book will take you through add-on development to extend
    JIRA's functionality, and will give insights into building applications on top
    of JIRA using the REST API. Various aspects of migration from other tools using
    CSV files will also be discussed. This book has a separate section on implementation

    a great tool that empowers JIRA administrators with tremendous flexibility. Additionally,
    we will also take a look at some of the common database tables to fetch useful
    results and discuss the possibilities to add custom CSS and JavaScript in our
    JIRA instance. Finally, we will conclude the book by going through the best practices
    and troubleshooting to help you find out what went wrong and how to fix it.
