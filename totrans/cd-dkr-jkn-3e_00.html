			<p><em class="italic">Continuous Delivery with Docker and Jenkins – Third Edition</em> explains the advantages of combining Jenkins and Docker to improve the continuous integration and delivery process of app development. It starts with setting up a Docker server and configuring Jenkins on it. It then outlines the steps to build applications on Docker files and integrate them with Jenkins using continuous delivery processes such as continuous integration, automated acceptance testing, and configuration management.</p>
			<p>Moving on, you will learn how to ensure quick application deployment with Docker containers, along with scaling Jenkins and using Kubernetes. After that, you will get to know how to deploy applications using Docker images and test them with Jenkins. Toward the end, the book will touch base with missing parts of the CD pipeline, which are the environments and infrastructure, application versioning, and non-functional testing.</p>
			<p>By the end of the book, you will know how to enhance the DevOps workflow by integrating the functionalities of Docker and Jenkins.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>The book targets DevOps engineers, system administrators, Docker professionals, or any stakeholders who would like to explore the power of working with Docker and Jenkins together.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p><a href="B18223_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor015"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Continuous Delivery</em>, demonstrates the pitfalls of the traditional delivery process and describes success stories, including Amazon and Yahoo.</p>
			<p><a href="B18223_02_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor034"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Docker</em>, provides a brief introduction to Docker and the concept of containerization and looks at the benefits in terms of running applications and services using this platform. In addition, we will also describe, step by step, how to set up Docker Community Edition on a local machine or a server running Linux and check to see whether Docker is running properly.</p>
			<p><a href="B18223_03_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor073"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuring Jenkins</em>, introduces the Jenkins tool, their architecture, and procedures to install master/agent instances on a Docker server, without Docker and using Kubernetes. Then, we'll see how to scale agents. Finally, you will get a working Jenkins instance ready to build applications integrated with your source code repository service.</p>
			<p><a href="B18223_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor106"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Continuous Integration Pipeline</em>, describes how the classic continuous integration pipeline entails three steps: checkout, building, and unit tests. In this chapter, you will learn how to build it using Jenkins and what other steps should be considered (such as code coverage and static code analysis).</p>
			<p><a href="B18223_05_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor133"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Automated Acceptance Testing</em>, explains how, before releasing an application, you need to make sure that the whole system works as expected by running automated acceptance tests. Ordinarily, applications connect with databases, cache, messaging, and other tools that require other servers to run these services. This is why the whole environment has to be set up and kept ready before the test suite is started. In this chapter, you will learn Docker Registry concepts and how to build a system made of different components running as Docker containers.</p>
			<p><a href="B18223_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor152"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Clustering with Kubernetes</em>, explains how to scale to multiple teams and projects using Docker tools. In this chapter, you will be introduced to Kubernetes and learn how to use it in the continuous delivery process.</p>
			<p><a href="B18223_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor185"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Configuration Management with Ansible</em>, describes how, once you have scaled your servers, to deploy your application in production. In this chapter, you will learn how to release an application on a Docker production server using configuration management tools such as Chef and Ansible. Additionally, you will learn about the infrastructure as code approach and the Terraform tool.</p>
			<p><a href="B18223_08_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor218"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Continuous Delivery Pipeline</em>, focuses on the missing parts of the final pipeline, which are the environments and infrastructure, application versioning, and non-functional testing. Once this chapter has been concluded, the complete continuous delivery pipeline will be ready.</p>
			<p><a href="B18223_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor242"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Advanced Continuous Delivery</em>, explains how, after building a complete pipeline, you can address more difficult real-life scenarios. Beginning with parallelizing the pipeline tasks, we will then show how to roll back to the previous version, how to run performance tests, what to do with database changes, and how to proceed with legacy systems and manual tests.</p>
			<p><a href="B18223_10_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor266"><em class="italic">Best Practices</em></a>, this includes best practices to be followed throughout the book.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Docker requires a 64-bit Linux operating system. All examples in this book have been developed using Ubuntu 20.04, but any other Linux system with kernel version 3.10 or above is sufficient.</p>
