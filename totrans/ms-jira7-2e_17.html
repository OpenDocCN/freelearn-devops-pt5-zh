Imagine a case where a project manager asks you to remove a certain custom field from one of his project's screens, but you accidentally remove it from other projects too. In this chapter, we will discuss the best practices JIRA administrators can employ to maintain their instances.</p><p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">A word of caution before modifying default schemes and configurations</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">The JIRA customization process</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Using project context to assign different options in multiple projects</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Creating too many custom fields—a factor in slow performance</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Choosing a custom field type wisely</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Defining permissions</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">JIRA's <strong>Audit Log</strong></li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding the announcement banner</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Adding an introduction</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Performing regular indexing</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Final tips</li></ul></div><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec100"/>A word of caution before modifying default schemes and configurations</h1></div></div></div><p>A newly-installed, fresh JIRA instance comes with a lot of default schemes for issue types, workflows, field configurations, and permissions. These default configurations are suitable for simple bug tracking and have a process that is applicable to any generic project. Don't be tempted to start customizing the configurations too soon. If JIRA is being used for the first time in the company, then it's a good idea to pilot it with default configurations. This will give users a good idea of what JIRA has to offer and collect feedback from the users.</p><p>When you are ready to customize configurations, either start with the blank configuration, or create a copy of the default configuration and then make your changes in that.</p></div></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec101"/>The JIRA customization process</h1></div></div></div><p>Customizing JIRA should be considered a project in itself. It's quite easy to start making changes while configuring JIRA, but you should always plan your customization first and document them.</p><p>You can perform these steps to begin the customization process:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Pilot JIRA with default configurations.</li><li class="listitem">Gather feedback.</li><li class="listitem">Document the proposed configurations.</li><li class="listitem">Test the configurations on <strong>sandbox</strong>.</li><li class="listitem">Implement it on production.</li><li class="listitem">Standardize the configurations.</li><li class="listitem">Set up a <strong>Change Control Board</strong> (<strong>CCB</strong>).</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl2sec133"/>Piloting JIRA with default configurations</h2></div></div></div><p>The move to a new tool always faces resistance from users. JIRA is no exception; however, JIRA has the advantage of being intuitive and it allows you to have a clear distinction between usage and administrative sections. When deploying JIRA for the first time, always use the default configurations and ask users to test it for a few days. This will make sure that users first get comfortable with the features that come with JIRA out of the box. This pilot should ideally be done for at least one candidate from each team, consisting of a project manager, project lead, developer, and tester.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl2sec134"/>Gathering feedback</h2></div></div></div><p>At the end of the pilot phase, ask the users to give their feedback. The following questions can be asked on the feedback form:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Were the default issue types sufficient for your project?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What changes would you like to perform in the workflow?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Were the default fields enough to capture the information?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do you want e-mail notifications?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">How many types of users will be using JIRA?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Do you want some users to have restricted access?</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">What kinds of reports would you like to have?</li></ul></div><p>The answers to these important questions will give you a very good understanding of desired customizations from various stakeholders in the project.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl2sec135"/>Documenting and finalizing the proposed configurations</h2></div></div></div><p>Merely collecting the feedback is not enough to start the customizations. It's very important to first document these customizations in a document to describe the requirements.</p><p>We discussed in detail how to gather the requirements in <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6.  Sample Implementation of Use Cases">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Sample Implementation of Use Cases</em>. Ideally, a separate document for each use case should be prepared. This document should be updated before making any changes in the system. This will ensure that if a new JIRA administrator joins the company, they will not have any problems understanding JIRA's customizations.</p><p>Once this document is prepared, share it with the stakeholders and ask them to give their input. Organize a meeting with them to fine-tune the requirements and make necessary changes to this document. Eventually, this document should have the details of all the actual customizations that will be performed in JIRA. What new issue types need to be created, workflows should be visualized in the documents along with the new states that need to be created, and permission schemes and notification schemes should also be mentioned.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl2sec136"/>Testing configurations on sandbox</h2></div></div></div><p>Once the requirements are finalized, you should test them in a test environment first. For this, set up a sandbox JIRA instance (which is an exact copy of your production). All the new and old changes in the existing configuration should first be tested in the sandbox. It's really important to have the sandbox for cases when JIRA needs to be upgraded to a new version and when you want to evaluate a new plugin.</p><p>The sandbox, which is an exact copy of production, will give the stakeholder a chance to test their requested customizations without worrying about any damage being done in production.</p><p>During this testing phase, the stakeholders will surely give you a lot of feedback and ask you to improvise certain customizations that they couldn't perceive earlier. Note down all these changes and make any necessary amendments to the document.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl2sec137"/>Implementing on the production stage</h2></div></div></div><p>Once the implementation is successful on the test environment, you can then perform the customizations manually, on production. At this time, the JIRA administrator will have all the information in front of them in the JIRA configuration document. Making actual implementations on production will not take much time.</p><p>However, if you are making any changes in the JIRA instance, which is already being used by several users, then it's a good idea to first notify them of the change. You can write a short release note and mention the changes that are being made. This will avoid surprising the users with unexpected changes. Applying changes in the configurations usually doesn't require any downtime, but if you make changes in the workflow, it's always a good idea to do it when no one is using the instance. For this reason, notify users of any downtime well in advance.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl2sec138"/>Standardizing configurations</h2></div></div></div><p>JIRA has a wide range of applications. It's an issue tracking and project management tool. This tool can be used not only for bug tracking, but also for test management, helpdesk, requirement management, and agile tracking.</p><p>Now initially, when JIRA is implemented, it will be customized for a specific use case for one or more projects, but eventually, as more teams start using JIRA, they will request more customizations. JIRA allows you to use the same configurations in multiple projects, but when the number of projects grows, the same schemes cannot be used for all of them. So, it becomes very important to standardize your configurations in JIRA and ask the new teams to follow them.</p><p>Let's take a look at the following scenario in JIRA with three different use cases:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>
<p>
<strong>Use case</strong>
</p>
</td><td>
<p>
<strong>Number of projects</strong>
</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>Test management</p>
</td><td>
<p>10</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>Helpdesk</p>
</td><td>
<p>5</p>
</td></tr><tr><td>
<p>Requirements management</p>
</td><td>
<p>2</p>
</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see in the preceding table, there are multiple projects using the same configuration. Now, one of the project managers using the test management scheme may request that you add a new custom field in their project or make one of the existing fields mandatory. These minor customizations will affect all the other projects using the same configurations. We can limit these customizations to a single project by creating a new set of schemes, but this will lead to more maintenance for the JIRA administrator.</p><p>Avoid creating multiple schemes for the same use case and, before accepting any change in the existing configurations, talk to the stakeholders of all the projects using that configuration. If one project manager requests an additional custom field, discuss this with other project managers and make the changes after confirmation from all the stakeholders.</p><p>So, it's very important to standardize your configurations as much as possible, and reuse these configurations in other projects.</p><p>In <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Customizing JIRA for Test Management">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Customizing JIRA for Test Management</em>, and <a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6.  Sample Implementation of Use Cases">Chapter 6</a>, <em>Sample Implementation of Use Cases</em>, we discussed how to customize JIRA in detail, with various examples.</p></div><div><div><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl2sec139"/>Setting up a CCB</h2></div></div></div><p>JIRA administrators have the responsibility of implementing customization requests. As discussed in the previous section, configurations should be standardized as much as possible, but sometimes changes need to be done in JIRA to support JIRA's requirements. Any change, be it large or small, needs to be analyzed first, because it may lead to further issues. I recommend a CCB, whose job is to study the customizations before implementing them.</p><p>I recommend the following process:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Create a project in JIRA for support requests with various issue types such as bug, improvements, and new feature.</li><li class="listitem">Ask your users to raise a ticket in this project for any JIRA support.</li><li class="listitem">Once the ticket is created, analyze the requested customizations and perform an impact analysis.</li><li class="listitem">If there is no impact, implement the changes directly in JIRA.</li><li class="listitem">If there is any impact on other projects, discuss the changes with the stakeholders of the other projects.</li><li class="listitem">On the basis of your discussion with stakeholders, make a decision on whether or not to implement the change in JIRA.</li></ol></div><div><div><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl3sec69"/>Various scenarios for impact analysis</h3></div></div></div><p>Let's take a look at some of the customization requests from users and their possible impact on the instance:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec102"/>Using project context to assign different options in multiple projects</h1></div></div></div><p>Let's say we have a custom field called <strong>Customer</strong>. This is a select list with different values, which users can select while creating an issue. If JIRA is used by multiple teams, each working on a different project, it's quite possible that the customer list will be different. One project may cater to a different set of customers than others. One approach to deal with this situation is to enter all the customers in a single list, but this will lead to confusion among the team members who raise the tickets and it will also lead to errors, because users might select the wrong customers.</p><p>A different custom field can be created for each project to deal with this problem (each having its own list of customers), but this leads to redundancy, as we would store the same type of information in each list.</p><p>JIRA's custom fields offer a solution to this problem using context. Perform these steps to create a new context:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Go to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>Issues</strong> | <strong>Custom Fields</strong> (under <strong>FIELDS</strong>) and you will see the list of all the custom fields in your system.</li><li class="listitem">Click on the gear icon for your custom fields and select <strong>Configure</strong>:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_17_001.jpg" alt="Using project context to assign different options in multiple projects"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen for <strong>Configure Custom Field: Customer</strong>, click on the <strong>Add new context</strong> link.<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_17_002.jpg" alt="Using project context to assign different options in multiple projects"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">On the next screen for <strong>Add configuration scheme context</strong>, enter the <strong>Configuration scheme label</strong> and <strong>Description</strong>. Under <strong>Choose applicable context</strong>, select the name of the project for which this context will be available:<p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_17_003.jpg" alt="Using project context to assign different options in multiple projects"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">You will now have a new <strong>Context for Demo project</strong>, but there are no options yet. Click on the <strong>Edit Options</strong> link:<p>

</p><div><img src="img/image_17_005.jpg" alt="Using project context to assign different options in multiple projects"/></div><p>
</p></li><li class="listitem">Finally, you will have two sets of options for this custom field. One is default and the other is for a specific project:<p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec103"/>Creating too many custom fields – A factor in slow performance</h1></div></div></div><p>We just discussed how companies should devise a process to manage their customizations in their JIRA instance. As the JIRA instance grows in terms of number of issues, projects, and users, the performance of the instance will start degrading over a period of time. One of the major factors that leads to slow performance is a lot of custom fields.</p><p>JIRA administrators create custom fields to store data that can be filtered out in the reports. This is fine, but an attempt should be made to reuse the existing custom fields. For this reason, create fields with generic names so that they can be reused easily in different projects.</p><p>Let's take a look at some generic custom fields that can be created in JIRA instances:</p><div><table border="1"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><tbody><tr><td>
<p>
<strong>Custom field</strong>

</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Think twice before adding new custom fields in the system. Your users will request that you create many fields, but remember, having too many custom fields can cause performance issues. Always try to optimize the use of custom fields. For instance, before creating custom fields for <strong>Text Field (multiline)</strong>, try to reuse the <strong>Description</strong> field; if you want users to fill in the details using a template with a predefined text template, then use the method described in <a class="link" href="ch14.html" title="Chapter 14. Customizing Look, Feel, and Behavior">Chapter 14</a>, <em>Customizing Look, Feel, and Behavior</em>.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec104"/>Choosing a custom field type wisely</h1></div></div></div><p>When you are gathering the requirements from various stakeholders, they will ask you to create new custom fields to capture a specific piece of information. In the previous section, we discussed how you should always try to optimize the usage of these fields. However, once you have decided on the custom fields that need to be created, before creating them in the instance, spend some time working with the types of custom fields. Once created, the type of fields cannot be changed easily.</p><p>For instance, if you want to store a single value, use <strong>Select List (single choice)</strong>, whereas to select multiple values, use <strong>Select List (multiple choices)</strong>. To capture dates, there is a date picker, and to store lengthy text, <strong>Text Field (multiline)</strong> can be used.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec105"/>Defining permissions</h1></div></div></div><p>It's very important to secure your data stored in JIRA. There could be several client projects in JIRA whose information cannot be shared with other teams. JIRA can also be accessed by your clients and it becomes more important to hide other projects from your clients and only give them access to the projects relevant to them. In <a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Customizing JIRA for Test Management">Chapter 4</a>, <em>Customizing JIRA for Test Management</em>, we discussed how a project can be accessed only by users of a specific group.</p><p>JIRA comes with an amazing permission system, which allows configuration at a granular level. JIRA has three types of permissions. These are:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Global permissions</strong>: These permissions apply to the whole JIRA instance. Permissions such as who can log in and who will be the JIRA administrator can be configured here.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Project permissions</strong>: These permissions apply to a specific project. Permissions such as who can access the project, create issues, and close issues can be configured here.</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc"><strong>Issue security levels</strong>: These permissions apply to the issues of a specific project to control who can view the issues.</li></ul></div><p>The permissions need to be defined at all these levels, so make sure that people with right access can view the data in JIRA.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec106"/>JIRA's Audit Log</h1></div></div></div><p>There is an <strong>A<strong>udit Log</strong>
</strong> in JIRA that keeps track of all the configuration changes that happen in JIRA. This log is quite useful for tracking any changes in the schemes; the best part is that this log is available through the JIRA administrative interface.</p><p>Let's access JIRA's <strong>Audit Log</strong>:</p><p>Navigate to <strong>JIRA Administration</strong> | <strong>System</strong> | <strong>Audit Log</strong> (under <strong>TROUBLESHOOTING AND SUPPORT</strong>):</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_17_007.jpg" alt="JIRA's Audit Log"/></div><p>
</p><p>As you can see in the preceding screenshot, events such as new user creation and modifications in the user group are recorded. The changes tracked by <strong>Audit Log</strong> are as follows:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">User management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Group management</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Project changes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Permission changes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Workflow changes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Notification scheme changes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Custom field changes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Component changes</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Version changes</li></ul></div><p>The JIRA administrator can refer to this <strong>Audit Log</strong> for troubleshooting purposes.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec107"/>Adding the announcement banner</h1></div></div></div><p>JIRA is a critical part of the software development life cycle and is used to store many kind of issues. Users rely on JIRA to check whether their daily tasks and managers use JIRA to keep track of their projects. JIRA administrators sometimes need to perform maintenance activities that require downtime for users. As a good practice, all the users, or at least the stakeholders, should be notified, but to avoid any surprises for the user, it's a good idea to give them an indication of any planned downtime.</p><p>JIRA has an option to add an announcement banner, which is visible all across the JIRA instance just after the main navigation. Perform these steps to add the announcement banner:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>System</strong> | <strong>Announcement Banner</strong> (under <strong>USER INTERFACE</strong>).</li><li class="listitem">In the <strong>Announcement</strong> text area, enter your message and click on the <strong>Set Banner</strong> button. You can also include HTML tags. Select <strong>Visibility Level</strong> as <strong>Public - Show to anyone</strong> to show this announcement to users who are not even logged in:<p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec108"/>Adding an introduction</h1></div></div></div><p>When you deploy new JIRA instances, users need to be trained; however, JIRA doesn't require in-depth training to start with basic usage and it's a good practice to give useful introductory information to users. This introduction will be visible not only to the users who are logged in, but also to the users who are logged out.</p><p>Perform these steps to add the introductory text:</p><div><ol class="orderedlist arabic"><li class="listitem">Navigate to <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>System</strong> | <strong>General Configuration</strong> and click on the <strong>Edit Settings</strong> button in the top-right corner:<p>

JIRA maintains and builds an internal search index, which is important for the quick retrieval of data. However, after making configuration changes, such as the creation of new field configuration schemes, adding new custom fields, and installing new plugins, the search index becomes out of sync. It's important to rebuild this search index from time to time so that users experience fast search times and can find the information they are looking for easily.</p><p>Whenever you make configuration-level changes that involve the search index (such as the creation of a new custom field), JIRA will prompt administrators to perform the search and you will get a message similar to the following in the administration section:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_17_012.jpg" alt="Performing regular indexing"/></div><p>
</p><p>You can either click on the <strong>Indexing</strong> link that appears along with this message or navigate to JIRA <strong>Administration</strong> | <strong>System</strong> | <strong>Indexing</strong> (under <strong>ADVANCED</strong>) to perform the indexing process.</p><p>You will get two options to perform <strong>Re-Indexing</strong>. The first option is <strong>Background re-index</strong>, which doesn't lock the JIRA instance and allows users to continue working on the JIRA instance, but takes more time. The second option is <strong>Lock JIRA and rebuild index</strong>, which locks the instance and blocks users from accessing JIRA, but is quite quick:</p><p>
</p><div><img src="img/image_17_013.jpg" alt="Performing regular indexing"/></div><p>
</p><p>Click on the <strong>Re-Index</strong> button to start the re-indexing process. Depending on the size of your instance, this process may take anywhere from a few seconds to a few hours, for large instances.</p><p>So, plan your indexing for every 15 days, during a period when there are fewer users accessing the instance.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch17lvl1sec110"/>Final tips</h1></div></div></div><p>Apart from the information shared in this chapter, there are some important maintenance activities, which any JIRA administrator should take care of to ensure the longevity and smooth functioning of your application:</p><div><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Perform backups from time to time</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Clean up old, big log files</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Plan your re-index only when it is prompted</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Scan your log file regularly</li><li class="listitem" style="list-style-type: disc">Run <strong>Integrity Checker</strong></li></ul></div><p>These additional points should be part of your maintenance checklist.</p></div>
