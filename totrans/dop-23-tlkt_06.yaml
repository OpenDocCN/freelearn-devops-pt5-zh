- en: The desired state of our applications is changing all the time. The most common
    reasons for new states are new releases. The process is relatively simple. We
    make a change and commit it to a code repository. We build it, and we test it.
    Once we're confident that it works as expected, we deploy it to a cluster. It
    does not matter whether that deployment is to a development, test, staging, or
    production environment. We need to deploy a new release to a cluster, even when
    that is a single-node Kubernetes running on a laptop. No matter how many environments
    we have, the process should always be the same or, at least, as similar as possible.

    on a testing or a production cluster. Interrupting consumers is disruptive, and
    that leads to loss of money and confidence in a product. Gone are the days when
    users did not care if an application sometimes did not work. There are so many
    competitors out there that a single bad experience might lead users to another
    solution. With today's scale, 0.1% of failed requests is considered disastrous.
    While we might never be able to reach 100% availability, we should certainly not
    cause downtime ourselves and must minimise other factors that could cause downtime.

    and create it again, you'll notice that the hash in the Pod name and ReplicaSet
    name remain consistent. This value is generated by hashing the PodTemplate of
    the ReplicaSet. As long as the PodTemplate is the same, the hash value will be
    the same as well. That way a Deployment can know whether anything related to the
    Pods has changed and, if it does, will create a new ReplicaSet.

    We'll jump to the second application in the stack and create a Deployment of the
    ReplicaSet that will create Pods based on the `vfarcic/go-demo-2` image. But,

    deployments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On the one hand, our applications are supposed to have very high availability.
    Depending on the context and the goals, we usually discuss how many nines are
    coming after 99%. At the very least, an application must have availability of
    at least 99.9%. More likely, it should be something closer to 99.99 or even 99.999
    percent availability. Hundred percent availability is often not possible or too
    expensive to accomplish. We cannot avoid all failures, but we can reduce them
    to acceptable limits.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No matter what the availability of SLA is, applications (at least when developed
    by us) must be scalable. Only when there are multiple replicas, can we hope for
    any decent availability. Scaled applications can not only spread the load across
    various instances but ensure that a failure of one replica will not produce downtime.
    Healthy instances are handling the load until the scheduler recreates failed ones.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: High availability is accomplished through fault tolerance and scalability. If
    either is missing, any failure might have disastrous effects.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason we're discussing failures and scalability lies in the nature of immutable
    deployments. If a Pod is unchangeable, the only way to update it with a new release
    is to destroy the old ones and put the Pods based on the new image in their place.
    Destruction of Pods is not much different from failures. In both cases, they cease
    to work. On the other hand, fault tolerance (re-scheduling) is a replacement of
    failed Pods.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The only essential difference is that new releases result in Pods being replaced
    with new ones based on the new image. As long as the process is controlled, new
    releases should not result in any downtime when multiple replicas of an application
    are running and when they are adequately designed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We should not worry about the frequency of new releases. The process should
    be the same no matter whether we make releases once a month, once a week, once
    a day, or every few minutes. If the release process produces any downtime, we
    might be compelled to deploy new versions infrequently. As a matter of fact, throughout
    the history of software development, we were taught that releases should be limited
    in number. A couple a year was the norm. Part of the reasons behind such infrequent
    releases was due to the downtime they produce. If we can reach zero-downtime deployments,
    the frequency can change, and we can aim for continuous deployment. We won't go
    into benefits behind continuous deployment just yet. It's not relevant at this
    point. Instead, we'll focus on zero-downtime deployments. Given a choice, no one
    would choose the little-bit-of-downtime strategy, so I'll assume that everyone
    wants to be able to release without interruptions.

    omit this field and leave it to the default value of `0`. We defined it mostly

    any of the previous five ReplicaSets.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `strategy` can be either the `RollingUpdate` or the `Recreate` type. The
    latter will kill all the existing Pods before an update. `Recreate` resembles
    the processes we used in the past when the typical strategy for deploying a new
    release was first to stop the existing one and then put a new one in its place.
    This approach inevitably leads to downtime. The only case when this strategy is
    useful is when applications are not designed for two releases to coexist. Unfortunately,
    that is still more common than it should be. If you're in doubt whether your application
    is like that, ask yourself the following question. Would there be an adverse effect
    if two different versions of my application are running in parallel? If that's
    the case, a `Recreate` strategy might be a good choice and *you must be aware
    that you cannot accomplish zero-downtime deployments*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `recreate` strategy is much better suited for our single-replica database.
    We should have set up the native database replication (not the same as Kubernetes
    ReplicaSet object), but, as explained earlier, that is out of the scope of this
    chapter (and probably this book).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we're running the database as a single replica, we must have mounted a network
    drive volume. That would allow us to avoid data loss when updating it or in case
    of a failure. Since most databases (MongoDB included) cannot have multiple instances
    writing to the same data files, killing the old release before creating a new
    one is a good strategy when replication is absent. We'll apply it later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `RollingUpdate` strategy is the default type, for a good reason. It allows
    us to deploy new releases without downtime. It creates a new ReplicaSet with zero
    replicas and, depending on other parameters, increases the replicas of the new
    one, and decreases those from the old one. The process is finished when the replicas
    of the new ReplicaSet entirely replace those from the old one.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When `RollingUpdate` is the strategy of choice, it can be fine-tuned with the
    `maxSurge` and `maxUnavailable` fields. The former defines the maximum number
    of Pods that can exceed the desired number (set using `replicas`). It can be set
    to an absolute number (for example, `2`) or a percentage (for example, `35%`).
    The total number of Pods will never exceed the desired number (set using `replicas`)
    and the `maxSurge` combined. The default value is `25%`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`maxUnavailable` defines the maximum number of Pods that are not operational.
    If, for example, the number of replicas is set to 15 and this field is set to
    4, the minimum number of Pods that would run at any given moment would be 11\.
    Just as the `maxSurge` field, this one also defaults to `25%`. If this field is
    not specified, there will always be at least 75% of the desired Pods.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    employ right practices, we can rely on `latest` tags being stable. Even if we
    discover they're not, we can remedy that quickly by creating a new `latest` tag.
    However, we cannot expect the same from third-party images. They must always be
    tagged to a specific version.
  prefs: []

    as soon as they are ready. However, there will be problems. Something unexpected
    will happen. A bug will sneak in and put our production cluster at risk. What
    should we do in such a case? The answer to that question largely depends on the
    size of the changes and the frequency of deployments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we are using continuous deployment process, we are deploying new releases
    to production fairly often. Instead of waiting until features accumulate, we are
    deploying small chunks. In such cases, fixing a problem might be just as fast
    as rolling back. After all, how much time would it take you to fix a problem caused
    by only a few hours of work (maybe a day) and that was discovered minutes after
    you committed? Probably not much. The problem was introduced by a very recent
    change that is still in engineer's head. Fixing it should not take long, and we
    should be able to deploy a new release soon.

    than a couple of hundreds of lines of code. In such a case, rolling forward might
    not be as fast as it should be. Still, rolling back might not even be possible.
    We might not be able to revert the deployment if database schema changed, and
    it is not compatible with the previous versions of the back-end that uses it.
    The moment the first transaction enters, we might lose the option to roll-back.
    At least, not without losing the data generated since the new release.

- en: If you have already used Docker Swarm, the logic behind Kubernetes Deployments
    should be familiar. Both serve the same purpose and can be used to deploy new
    applications or update those that are already running inside a cluster. In both
    cases, we can easily deploy new releases without any downtime (when application
    architecture permits that).

- en: Unlike the previous comparison between Kubernetes Pods, ReplicaSets, and Services
    with Docker Swarm Stacks, Kubernetes Deployments do provide a few potentially
    important functional differences. But, before we dive into the functional comparison,
    we'll take a moment to explore differences in how we define objects.

- en: It is evident that a Kubernetes Deployment requires a much longer definition
    with more a complex syntax. It is worth noting that Swarm's equivalent to `readinessProbe`
    and `livenessProbe` is not present in the stack because it is defined as a `HEALTHCHECK`
    inside the Dockerfile. Still, even if we remove them, a Kubernetes Deployment
    remains longer and more complicated.

- en: When comparing only the differences in the ways to define objects, Docker Swarm
    is a clear **winner**. Let's see what we can conclude from the functional point
    of view.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating the objects is reasonably straight-forward. Both `kubectl create` and
    `docker stack deploy` will deploy new releases without any downtime. New containers
    or, in case of Kubernetes, Pods will be created and, in parallel, the old ones
    will be terminated. So far, both solutions are, more or less, the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the main differences is what happens in case of a failure. A Kubernetes
    Deployment will not perform any corrective action in case of a failure. It will
    stop the update, leaving a combination of new and old Pods running in parallel.
    Docker Swarm, on the other hand, can be configured to rollback automatically.
    That might seem like another win for Docker Swarm. However, Kubernetes has something
    Swarm doesn't. We can use `kubectl rollout status` command to find out whether
    the update was a success or failure and, in case of the latter, we can `undo`
    the `rollout`. Even though we need a few commands to accomplish the same result,
    that might fare better when updates are automated. Knowing whether an update succeeded
    or failed allows us to not only execute a subsequent rollback action but also
    notify someone that there is a problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both approaches have their pros and cons. Docker Swarm's automated rollback
    is better suited in some cases, and Kubernetes update status works better in others.
    The methods are different, and there is no clear winner, so I'll proclaim it a
    tie.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Kubernetes Deployments can record history. We can use the `kubectl rollout history`
    command to inspect past rollout. When updates are working as expected, `history`
    is not very useful. But, when things go wrong, it might provide additional insight.
    That can be combined with the ability to rollback to a specific revision, not
    necessarily the previous one. However, most of the time, we rollback to the previous
    version. The ability to go back further in time is not very useful. Even when
    such a need arises, both products can do that. The difference is that Kubernetes
    Deployments allow us to go to a specific revision (for example, we're on the revision
    five, rollback to the revision two). With Docker Swarm, we'd have to issue a new
    update (for example, update the image to the tag 2.0). Since containers are immutable,
    the result is the same, so the difference is only in the syntax behind a rollback.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The ability to rollback to a specific version or a tag exists in both products.
    We can argue which syntax is more straightforward or more useful. The differences
    are minor, and I'll proclaim that there is no winner for that functionality. It's
    another tie.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since almost everything in Kubernetes is based on label selectors, it has a
    feature that Docker Swarm doesn't. We can update multiple Deployments at the same
    time. We can, for example, issue an update (`kubetl set image`) that uses filters
    to find all Mongo databases and upgrade them to a newer release. It is a feature
    that would require a few lines of bash scripting with Docker Swarm. However, while
    the ability to update all Deployments that match specific labels might sound like
    a useful feature, it often isn't. More often than not, such actions can produce
    undesirable effects. If, for example, we have five back-end applications that
    use Mongo database (one for each), we'd probably want to upgrade them in a more
    controlled fashion. Teams behind those services would probably want to test each
    of those upgrades and give their blessings. We probably wouldn't wait until all
    are finished, but upgrade a single database when the team in charge of it feels
    confident.

- en: There are the cases when updating multiple objects is useful so I must give
    this one to Kubernetes. It a minor win, but it still counts.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are a few other things that are easier to accomplish with Kubernetes.
    For example, due to the way Kubernetes Services work, creating a blue-green deployment
    process, instead of using rolling updates, is much easier. However, such a process
    falls into advanced usage so I'll leave it out of this comparison. It'll (probably)
    come later.

- en: It's difficult to say which solution provides better results. Docker Swarm continues
    to shine from the user-friendliness perspective. On the other hand, Kubernetes
    Deployments offer a few additional features.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is much simpler and easier to write a Docker Swarm stack file than a Kubernetes
    Deployment definition. Kubernetes Deployments offer a few additional functional
    features that Swarm does not have. However, those features are, for most use cases,
    of minor importance. Those that indeed matter are, more or less, the same.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don't make a decision based on the differences between Kubernetes Deployments
    and Docker Swarm stacks. Definition syntax is where Swarm has a clear win, while
    on the functional front Kubernetes has a tiny edge over Swarm. If you'd make a
    decision only based on deployments, Swarm might be a slightly better candidate.
    Or not. It all depends on what matters more in your case. Do you care about YAML
    syntax? Are those additional Kubernetes Deployment features something you will
    ever use?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In any case, Kubernetes has much more to offer, and any conclusion based on
    such a limited comparison scope is bound to be incomplete. We only scratched the
    surface. Stay tuned for more.
