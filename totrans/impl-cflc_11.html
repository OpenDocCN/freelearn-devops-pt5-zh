<h1 id="_idParaDest-271"><a id="_idTextAnchor272"/>Understanding the concept and need for scaling Confluence</h1>
<p>Fundamentally, <strong class="bold">scaling</strong> refers<a id="_idIndexMarker773"/> to the ability of a system or network to handle growing amounts of work or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth. In the software context, it implies the capacity of a system, network, or process to manage an increasing volume of operations without compromising performance. It’s ensuring your digital tools and strategies can grow parallel to your <a id="_idIndexMarker774"/>business demands and maintain the same level of efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
<p>When we talk about scaling Confluence, we refer to the ability of your Confluence platform to support the increasing number of users, pages, and spaces without performance degradation. This involves the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Horizontal scaling</strong>: Adding <a id="_idIndexMarker775"/>more machines or instances into the pool of resources</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Vertical scaling</strong>: Adding<a id="_idIndexMarker776"/> more power (CPU, RAM) to an existing machine</li>
</ul>
<p>However, since this book focuses exclusively on Confluence Cloud, you won’t need to deal with managing CPU, RAM, database maintenance, and other technical aspects; Atlassian handles such details with world-class standards. Nevertheless, having a basic understanding of these concepts can still be beneficial.</p>
<p>The relevance of scaling Confluence becomes evident when your organization experiences growth. As your teams expand, you must prepare your Confluence environment to accommodate the increased workload without faltering performance. Without appropriate scaling, your teams can encounter slowdowns or system crashes during peak usage times. On the other hand, a well-scaled Confluence platform can better manage large amounts of data, provide a more responsive user experience, and ultimately contribute to your teams’ productivity and efficiency. In other words, scaling Confluence is an indispensable catalyst for achieving seamless growth in dynamic and ambitious organizations, ensuring smooth, uninterrupted workflows as team sizes increase.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-272"><a id="_idTextAnchor273"/>Why choose Confluence for scaling your business operations?</h2>
<p>Whether <a id="_idIndexMarker777"/>you’re a startup expecting rapid growth or an established enterprise, Confluence can adapt to your needs with its scalable infrastructure designed to grow with your organization. The ability to scale horizontally by adding more resources as needed and vertically by enhancing the capabilities of existing resources provides the necessary flexibility for evolving businesses. With Confluence Cloud, Atlassian takes care of all the heavy lifting related to scalability, freeing you to concentrate on your core operations.</p>
<p>Confluence’s integrative <a id="_idIndexMarker778"/>and extensible features make it an ideal tool for scaling.

Also, as your organization scales, maintaining effective communication and collaboration becomes increasingly important. Confluence’s tools, such as its dynamic pages, intuitive UI, and powerful search capabilities, support this need by helping teams stay on the same page, streamline decision-making, and boost productivity as the organization grows.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-273"><a id="_idTextAnchor274"/>Identifying teams that require Confluence scaling</h2>
<p>As an <a id="_idIndexMarker779"/>organization evolves, so does its reliance on collaboration and communication tools such as Confluence. The need for scaling Confluence typically begins with recognizing signs of increased demand or strain on your existing setup. Teams experiencing slower load times, encountering storage limits, or finding it difficult to manage and locate content may indicate that your current Confluence setup is starting to fall short. Monitoring these indicators can help you anticipate when a team might require scaling.</p>
<p>An effective way to identify teams that might need scaling is to analyze usage patterns. Teams that consistently create a high volume of pages have a rapidly growing number of members or heavily use collaboration features such as comments and <code>@mentions</code> are likely candidates for scaling. Teams operating across different time zones might also benefit from scaling to meet the demand for round-the-clock availability.</p>
<p>Understanding your teams’ growth projections can also help to identify who requires Confluence scaling. Teams that are expanding rapidly, taking on large projects, or expected to grow shortly may need scaling sooner rather than later. Being prepared for this growth by scaling can help ensure these teams continue their work seamlessly, fostering<a id="_idIndexMarker780"/> productivity and reducing the likelihood of disruption.</p>
<p>We’ve covered the concept of and need for scaling Confluence so far; let’s now disscuss the risks of scaling Confluence.</p>
