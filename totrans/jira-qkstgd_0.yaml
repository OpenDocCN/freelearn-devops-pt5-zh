    and is written specially with this objective in mind. Like any other tool, Jira
    also has a learning curve, but quite often, you don''t want to spend weeks or
    even months just evaluating the product. This book will give you sufficient knowledge
    of using the tool not just as a user, but also as an administrator. The book starts
    by giving you a very good overview of Jira and how it can help you, then talks
    about Jira basics that will help you understand how it can be applied in your
    project. Later chapters are focused on exploring the customization capabilities
    of Jira to empower you with the knowledge of various schemes that cannot be ignored
    if you want to use Jira for your project.'
