    to the *Learning Path* feature in Dynamics 365 that delivers contextually rich
    content for the end users using the application. In this chapter, we will look
    at some of the new features that were introduced in Dynamics 365 with the July
    2017 and December 2016 update that we haven't covered in the previous chapters.

    added in Dynamics 365\. Some of these new features are targeted towards the end
    users who use the system on a daily basis, and others are for the administrators,
    customizers, or developers who are responsible for configuring, customizing, and
    developing solutions around it. In this chapter, we are going to look at some
    of these new features which we haven't covered in previous chapters.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the July 2017 update in Dynamics 365, we can now create a virtual type
    of custom entity. The name virtual applies because the data for the entity is
    not saved inside Dynamics 365\. The virtual entity on runtime, that is when accessed,
    gets its data from the data source provider configured for it. Currently, it only supports
    the OData V4 data provider. With an earlier version of Dynamics 365, before virtual
    entity, if we had to fetch or retrieve data from external data sources, we had
    to write custom code for that. Now, once we have the OData service ready and exposed,
    it becomes more of a configuration thing inside Dynamics 365, that the system
    administrator or customizer can take care of, without depending on the developer.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Relevance Search brings the power of Microsoft's Azure Search to improve search
    performance in Dynamics 365\. Data from the Dynamics 365 entities and the fields
    enabled for Relevance Search are synced with Azure Search DB, which performs an
    intuitive semantic search on it, and displays the results by relevance. Relevance
    Search searches across the fields in the entities and displays the results in
    the order of the most relevant to the least, unlike a categorized search, which
    displays results based on entity grouping. Also, compared to a categorized search
    which is limited to filtering the result by entity, the Relevance Search lets
    the Dynamics 365 user filter the result based on multiple conditions such as record
    type, owner, modified on, created on and any other filtering option defined for
    each of the entities, based on facets. As Relevance Search uses a semantic search,
    we do not need to specify a wild card in our search text. Relevance Search also
    highlights the matching words in the search results. Basically, once we have identified
    and configured the entities and their corresponding fields for Relevance Search,
    the full sync can take more than an hour, depending on the amount of data to be
    synced, when it runs the first time and then any subsequent changes made in Dynamics
    365 can take up to 15 minutes to appear in the search.
