			<h1 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor154"/>Chapter 1 – Introducing Jira Align</h1>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-153"><a id="_idTextAnchor155"/>Questions</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>What circumstances gave rise to the agile platform now known as Jira Align?</li>
				<li>Which scaling framework has a longstanding relationship with Jira Align? </li>
				<li>How many agile teams can belong to a program or "team of teams"?</li>
				<li>What role does leadership play in a Jira Align implementation?</li>
				<li>Why is it important to have a Jira Align Core Team?</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-154"><a id="_idTextAnchor156"/>Answers</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The rise of agile frameworks in the 1990s and formalization of the Agile Manifesto in 2001 provided principles and practices that enabled iterative and incremental delivery by a single team or handful of teams. By the mid 2000s, the need to coordinate larger groups of agile teams to deliver more complex systems inspired the platform that became Jira Align. </li>
				<li>Jira Align has had a close working relationship with the <strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>) since SAFe was launched in 2011.</li>
				<li>The general rule suggested by Jira Align and SAFe is that a program, or "team of teams", consists of 5 to 12 agile teams.</li>
				<li>Leadership is critical to a Jira Align implementation. The role of leadership is not just to provide funding, but to actively participate in, and lead, the effort for change. </li>
				<li>The Jira Align Core Team functions as the guiding coalition for the transformation effort. It is comprised of individuals "with skin in the game" who are willing to embrace change and lead by example.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor157"/>Chapter 2 – Implementing Jira Align</h1>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-156"><a id="_idTextAnchor158"/>Questions</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Why is it important to align the organizational language and reflect it in Jira Align?</li>
				<li>What are the most critical health checks when analyzing existing programs in Jira?</li>
				<li>How do you organize projects/boards in Jira to map with teams in Jira Align?</li>
				<li>What is the integration mapping between Jira and Jira Align?</li>
				<li>What are the three practices adopted by organizations that have achieved success at portfolio level?</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-157"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>Answers</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Aligning the organizational language is a success factor for digital transformation. It establishes a common understanding, fosters cohesiveness, consistency, and credibility, and increases productivity.</li>
				<li>Four of the seven health checks are critical. They are: #4 – There should only be one project assigned to a Jira board; #5 – Mark custom fields as optional, not required; #6 – A single sprint should only be tied to one board; and #7 – Sprints on a Jira board should not have overlapping dates.</li>
				<li>There are two options for mapping projects/boards in Jira to teams in Jira Align: (1) One Jira project per program (team of teams) with one board per team and one active sprint per board – this requires a custom team field in Jira to drive each board; and (2) One Jira project per team with one board per team and one active sprint per board – this requires a separate project for Jira epics and results in a greater quantity of Jira projects than the first option.</li>
				<li>The integration mapping between Jira and Jira Align can be found by going to the user menu, selecting <strong class="bold">Help</strong> | <strong class="bold">Quick Links</strong> | <strong class="bold">Guides</strong>, and then clicking on the <strong class="bold">10X: Jira Integration Guide</strong>.</li>
				<li>Organizations that achieve the greatest success at the portfolio level adopt the following three practices: (1) Establishing a portfolio vision and roadmap, (2) Funding value streams and teams, not projects, and (3) Connecting the enterprise.</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-158"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>Chapter 3 – Navigating Jira Align</h1>

				<li>How does Jira Align facilitate onboarding and continuous learning?</li>
				<li>What is the importance of the <strong class="bold">Why?</strong> button?</li>
				<li>How do you link a work item to a higher-level work item?</li>
				<li>What are the options for estimating features, capabilities, and portfolio epics?</li>
			</ol>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Answers</h1>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">The three key areas are the navigation menu, configuration bar, and workspace.</li>
				<li>Jira Align facilitates onboarding and continuous learning through <strong class="bold">Framework Maps</strong>, <strong class="bold">Training Simulations</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Checklists</strong>.</li>
				<li>The <strong class="bold">Why?</strong> button provides context for team members' efforts, showing how their work connects to a high-level strategy and is valuable to the mission of their company.</li>
				<li>Unlinked items are called "orphans." To review and connect them up to higher-level items, begin in the backlog and click on the <strong class="bold">Orphan Objects</strong> button near the top-right corner of the workspace. In the panel that opens, you can multi-select work items to assign to a parent item, which you can search for by ID, name, or tags. This makes it easy to connect each level of backlog item to its parent item.</li>
				<li>There are three options for sizing features, capabilities, and epics: T-shirt size, points, and team/member weeks.</li>
