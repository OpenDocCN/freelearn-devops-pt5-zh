- en: Docker is a game-changer when it comes to modern applications' architecture
    and how they are deployed. It has now grown into a key driver of innovation beyond
    system administration, and it has had a significant impact on the world of web
    development and beyond. But how can you make sure you're keeping up with the innovations
    it's driving? How can you be sure you're using it to its full potential?

- en: This book shows you how; it not only demonstrates how to use Docker more effectively,
    it also helps you rethink and re-imagine what's possible with Docker.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You will cover basic topics, such as building, managing, and storing images,
    along with best practices, before delving into Docker security. You'll find everything
    related to extending and integrating Docker in new and innovative ways. Docker
    Compose, Docker Swarm, and Kubernetes will help you take control of your containers
    in an efficient way.

    exactly what's possible with Docker and how seamlessly it fits into your local
    workflow, highly available public cloud platforms, and other tools.
