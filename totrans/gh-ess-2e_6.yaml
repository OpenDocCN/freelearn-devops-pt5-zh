    and a repository. There are many things you can do to personalize your experience
    in GitHub and many settings you can change in order to follow a specific workflow
    with your fellow teammates.

    page, such as associating more than one email with your account, adding multiple
    SSH keys, and setting up two-factor authentication.

    you set in your local Git configuration to associate commits with your GitHub
    account. There is no limit to the emails that you can add to your account, but
    you can have only one primary address. This is where GitHub will send you any
    notifications and it is this address that will be used when editing and committing
    files via the web interface.

- en: GitHub provides two ways to authenticate a user when using Git. You can use
    Git over HTTP or Git over SSH. For a detailed explanation of the Git protocols,
    visit [https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html](https://git-scm.com/book/ch4-1.html).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using Git over HTTP, you must provide your username and password each time
    you make a change, unless you cache your GitHub password in Git. For more details,
    see the article at [https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/](https://help.github.com/articles/caching-your-github-password-in-git/).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The preferred and more secure way is to use Git over SSH. The concept is that
    you create a personal unique SSH key pair whose public key you upload to your
    GitHub profile. You can repeat this process as many times as you wish since GitHub
    allows you to have multiple SSH keys associated with your account. This way, you
    can have one key to use with your laptop and a different one with your desktop
    or your server.

    `git@github.com:USERNAME/REPOSITORY.git`.

    the GitHub UI or go directly to [https://github.com/settings/keys](https://github.com/settings/keys).
    When you add an SSH public key, you must give it a Title so that you can remember
    where this key came from. At the Key area, you paste the contents of the public
    key. As you can see, GitHub also provides some useful information such as the
    fingerprint of the key, when it was added, and when it was last used:'

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Setting up two-factor authentication provides an extra layer of security for
    your account. Using only the password to sign in can prove susceptible to security
    threats, since the attacker only needs a single piece of information.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is done by having an extra authentication code generated onto your cell
    phone or tablet. In the case of a smartphone, you must install an application
    that can handle the **Time-based One-Time Password** (**TOTP**) technology. If
    you are looking for an open source application, check [https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP](https://github.com/andOTP/andOTP)

    are times when you want a different branch to be your default, based on one's
    workflow, as we saw in [Chapter 4](part0098.html#2TEN40-184576c1044a4350bd24f18b869c0732),

    is considered stable and well-tested, whereas you have a different branch named
    develop that is used for daily pushes and testing new features. Based on this
    assumption, the develop branch gets updated more often than the master branch.
    Practically, you'd want your project to seem active; having a branch that gets
    updated every day in the front page is much more appealing.
