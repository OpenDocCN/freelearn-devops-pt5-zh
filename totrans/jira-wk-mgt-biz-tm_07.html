		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-83"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor082"/>Chapter 5</em>: JWM Toolset: Summary, List, Timeline, and the Calendar</h1>
			<p>It has taken us a little while to get here, but now we get to view some of the new and wonderful tools that come with <strong class="bold">Jira Work Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">JWM</strong>) projects. We will look at these throughout this chapter and the next to give us ample time to see how each tool functions. </p>
			<p>There was a lot of marketing by Atlassian surrounding JWM when it first rolled out, and they are continuing to do a great job with updates to the product by fixing any initial bugs and deploying additional enhancements to the features. </p>
			<p>Now is the perfect time to try out the product if you haven't already. Refer to previous chapters to get your first project created and then add some issues, and as we progress through this chapter, see the real power by interacting with several or even all of the components we discuss.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The features of JWM</li>
				<li>Issues and their relationship to the JWM features</li>
				<li>JWM <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section</li>
				<li>Using the <strong class="bold">List</strong> </li>
				<li>Working with the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong></li>
				<li>Adding issues to the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong></li>
				<li>New terms learned in this chapter</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Upon completion of this chapter, you will have learned which features are available in JWM and how to interact with the <strong class="bold">List</strong>, <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> functionality. You will also understand the intention of the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section and how the data gets populated.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-84"><a id="_idTextAnchor083"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As JWM is only available in the <strong class="bold">Jira Cloud environment</strong>, the requirement for this chapter is simple: <em class="italic">access to a Jira Cloud environment</em>.</p>
			<p>If you already have access to Jira Cloud, that's great—you are ready to go! If not, Atlassian provides a free JWM account for up to 10 users. You can create your account by going to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free">https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free</a> and following the instructions. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-85"><a id="_idTextAnchor084"/>The features of JWM</h1>
			<p>Now, after<a id="_idIndexMarker257"/> all of the fanfare, we get to see the features. A list of components is available on the left-hand menu directly under the project name, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.1_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.1 – List of components&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.1 – List of components</p>
			<p>We'll now provide a quick description of the components, but we will delve more fully into each one in the coming sections. Every feature has been created with a specific purpose in mind and provides functionality that is different from the others. Remember that most of these tools are only available for JWM projects:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Summary</strong>: The <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section<a id="_idIndexMarker258"/> is just that. It provides you with a summary of activities that have been happening in your project, along with some key statistics.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">List</strong>: The <strong class="bold">List</strong> is <a id="_idIndexMarker259"/>already a fan favorite and provides a listing of all issues in your project. The ingenious part is that each column includes inline editing. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Board</strong>: The <strong class="bold">Board</strong> has<a id="_idIndexMarker260"/> existed for quite some time, and although it is not new, there is some new functionality associated with it. It provides you with an easy-to-use <strong class="bold">Kanban-style</strong> view of your issues, presented as cards.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Calendar</strong>: The <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> presents<a id="_idIndexMarker261"/> issues as items on the calendar but includes interactive links, allowing you direct access to issues. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>: A <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker262"/> roadmap or <strong class="bold">Gantt-style</strong> view of issues in your project, but this view also provides interactive functionality right on the timeline. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Forms</strong>: At the time of writing this book, there was just one form available, but the <strong class="bold">Forms</strong> component <a id="_idIndexMarker263"/>comes with easy-to-create functionality and allows users, exterior to or within your project, to quickly create new issues or requests. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issues</strong>: As with the <strong class="bold">Board</strong>, this is an<a id="_idIndexMarker264"/> existing feature but provides functionality not seen elsewhere on projects. Also, it allows you to create filters and view the results in a list or as a single issue. </li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now that we are aware of the new features, let's see what the relationship looks like between the features and the issues we create to capture our work. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-86"><a id="_idTextAnchor085"/>Issues and their relationships to the JWM features</h1>
			<p>JWM features are just<a id="_idIndexMarker265"/> a viewset of issues we have created and identify the work we need to do. Issues then relate to the various tools in their unique ways, but since issues are the main element that describes the work that we do, the features are individually developed with that functionality in mind—in other words, each feature provides an enhanced method of interacting with the issues. That then leads us to select the feature best suited to how we want to work with a set of issues. </p>
			<p>So, we once again provide a list of features here and identify their relationships to issues:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Summary</strong>: Issues are <a id="_idIndexMarker266"/>shown in the context of changes that are happening to the issue. This is seen as an activity stream or as statics in aggregate form for the details of the issues. The information is view-only. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">List</strong>: A simple list of <a id="_idIndexMarker267"/>all the issues in your project, which can be reduced by applying filters. It also allows you to edit an issue directly inline in the list. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Board</strong>: The classic Kanban <a id="_idIndexMarker268"/>view—displaying the issue as a card on the board with selected information visible. It also shows you a graphical representation of where each issue is at in terms of the workflow for the project—whether it has just been started or is close to being done. This is view-only, and you must click on the card to be able to edit it. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Calendar</strong>: The <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>calendar is view-only and consists of a monthly display of issues by <strong class="bold">Due Date</strong>. You must click on an individual issue to be able to edit it. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>: As already mentioned, this is a<a id="_idIndexMarker270"/> roadmap-type view of your issues. You can adjust the start or end date of an issue directly on the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> or add dependencies, but no other data is editable. You must click on the <strong class="bold">Issue</strong> key to be able to make additional changes. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Forms</strong>: A form<a id="_idIndexMarker271"/> is just an intake layout for new work that provides an easy means to create new issues. You cannot view any issues while in a form—it is for creation only.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issues</strong>: This view<a id="_idIndexMarker272"/> provides a myriad of ways to interact with issues. While in <strong class="bold">List</strong> view mode, you can change the status of an issue but no other information. <strong class="bold">Detail</strong> view mode allows you to change all fields that appear on the edit screen for your project. The following screenshot shows how to select these view modes:</li>
			</ul>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.2_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.2 – Issues: LIST and DETAIL views&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.2 – Issues: LIST and DETAIL views</p>
			<p>In the following sections, we will begin our discussion of some of the features. The <strong class="bold">Board</strong> was already covered in <a href="B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes</em>, and some features will be covered in <a href="B17952_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Forms, Issues, Dashboards, and Reports</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-87"><a id="_idTextAnchor086"/>JWM Summary section</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section is our<a id="_idIndexMarker273"/> first unique JWM feature to discuss. However, it can be seen as a compilation of existing functionality placed together to provide helpful insight into your project, and if you have previously used dashboards in Jira, this probably has a similar feel to you. As mentioned previously, we will further explore dashboards in our next chapter, <a href="B17952_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Forms, Issues, Dashboards, and Reports</em>.</p>
			<p>As you might guess, the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section is intended to give you a quick overview of what's happening with your project. The 30,000-feet-view cliché is a good one to apply here. The feature is broken into two sections: <strong class="bold">Activity</strong> and <strong class="bold">Statistics</strong>. Each is presented as a link and a tab-like format directly under the summary name. </p>
			<p>If you have added a description to your project, it will appear between the <strong class="bold">Activity</strong> and <strong class="bold">Statistics</strong> links and the activity feed. Project lead and project key information is presented to the right, parallel to the project description, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.3_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.3 – Summary section with description&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.3 – Summary section with description</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-88"><a id="_idTextAnchor087"/>Activity</h2>
			<p>The large collection of<a id="_idIndexMarker274"/> historical information presented under the project description is similar, if not identical, to the activity feed gadget used in dashboards. Its purpose is to provide you with an easy-to-read flow of all activity that is happening on all issues in the JWM project, and it saves having to read through dozens or even hundreds of emails that get <a id="_idIndexMarker275"/>sent to <strong class="bold">watchers</strong>.</p>
			<p>The activity information appears in chronological order, with the most recent history being displayed at the top. Events or changes are grouped by the day on which they happened. If the activity occurred within the last week, you see headings such as <strong class="bold">Today</strong>, <strong class="bold">Monday</strong>, or <strong class="bold">Friday</strong>. Events older than one week will be grouped with the date of the occurrence, such as <strong class="bold">August 09</strong> or <strong class="bold">July 31</strong>. You can see an overview of this in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.4_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.4 – Summary activity &#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.4 – Summary activity </p>
			<p>The data shown is<a id="_idIndexMarker276"/> static based on the last refresh of the information. To do a new refresh, click on the gear icon to the right at the top of the list and then click on <strong class="bold">Refresh</strong>, as seen in the following screenshot. You can also see an <strong class="bold">Extensible Markup Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">XML</strong>) feed for <a id="_idIndexMarker277"/>the activity data by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Feed</strong> icon to the left of the <strong class="bold">Refresh</strong> icon. To get back to the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section, simply click the back button on your browser: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.5_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.5 – Summary activity refresh&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.5 – Summary activity refresh</p>
			<p>There is a small amount of statistical data also available on the <strong class="bold">Activity</strong> tab view on the right-hand side below the project lead and key information. The top section will show a grouping of the issues in your project based on the current status of each issue. </p>
			<p>This information is similar to the <strong class="bold">Issue Statistics</strong> gadget that is available for dashboards (with <strong class="bold">Status</strong> as the issue statistic). The colored bar (grayscale in the printed book version) depicts a banded visual of the number in each status in relation to the other statuses. Hovering over each band will show you the number of issues in that status. </p>
			<p>Each status name is a link that, if clicked on, will take you to the standard organization-wide search function for your Jira instance. It will present issues matching the number for that status in the <strong class="bold">Jira Issues</strong> view. That view will be discussed more in <a href="B17952_06_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor105"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Forms, Issues, Dashboards, and Reports</em>. To get back to the <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section, click the <strong class="bold">Back</strong> button on your browser. </p>
			<p>Below the <strong class="bold">Issue Status</strong> section is<a id="_idIndexMarker278"/> another issue statistic gadget—the primary one is for <strong class="bold">Priority</strong>. In a similar fashion as with statuses, this gadget will show you a grouping of issues by their current priority. Clicking on the priority name will take you to the same standard <strong class="bold">Jira Issues</strong> view noted previously. </p>
			<p>Finally, you can switch this bottom section to an additional gadget grouping of <strong class="bold">Unresolved Issues by Assignee</strong>. The same functionality applies to this gadget as well. Since this bottom section includes a dropdown, expect additional gadgets to be available in the future. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-89"><a id="_idTextAnchor088"/>Statistics</h2>
			<p>Next, let's take a look at the <strong class="bold">Statistics</strong> tab. This display provides much of the same information as in the <strong class="bold">Activity</strong> view <a id="_idIndexMarker279"/>but in more of a dashboard-type view, as illustrated in the following screenshot. There is also a section at the top with several built-in filters related to the issues in your project. Clicking any of these takes you to the standard <strong class="bold">Jira Issues</strong> view: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.6_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.6 – Summary statistics&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.6 – Summary statistics</p>
			<p>As you can see <a id="_idIndexMarker280"/>from the preceding screenshot, having a good summary available to see what is going on with your project at a high level can be very helpful, and since it is a top-level menu item, it is easy to find. </p>
			<p>Next, we will begin interacting with features that we can use to make changes to our issues and to have them displayed in a variety of formats. First up will be the <strong class="bold">List</strong>. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-90"><a id="_idTextAnchor089"/>Using the List</h1>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">List</strong> is one <a id="_idIndexMarker281"/>of the most exciting new features and provides fantastic new functionality. While it appears to be very similar to the standard <strong class="bold">Jira Issues</strong> view, the JWM <strong class="bold">List</strong> is unique in that all the columns provide inline editing functionality. </p>
			<p>This new feature rivals the <strong class="bold">queue</strong> capabilities of the <strong class="bold">Jira Service Management </strong>(<strong class="bold">JSM</strong>) product as <a id="_idIndexMarker282"/>that tool's primary view of multiple issues. No board is created with JSM projects, and as JSM is mainly intended to be a ticketing-type system, agents rely heavily on the various queues available. </p>
			<p>For JWM projects, however, the <strong class="bold">List</strong> provides an alternative view to the <strong class="bold">Board</strong>, along with enhanced editing capabilities directly in the tool. The feature is still under development, but I think you will find this to be a very welcome addition to the standard Jira functionality. </p>
			<p>To access the <strong class="bold">List</strong>, simply click <a id="_idIndexMarker283"/>on the <strong class="bold">List</strong> menu option to the left. The <strong class="bold">List</strong> will display a set of columns matching the system fields available for the project. There is one column per field displayed. The default list of fields includes the following in order, from left to right: </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Type</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Key</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Summary</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Status</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Assignee</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Due date</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Priority</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Labels</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Created</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Updated</strong></li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reporter</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>You can see an overview of some of these fields in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.7_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.7 – List&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.7 – List</p>
			<p>As you can see in <em class="italic">Figure 5.7</em>, only about half of the fields will be visible when you come into the display. You will need to use the scroll bar at the bottom of the list to see the additional fields to the right. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-91"><a id="_idTextAnchor090"/>Changing columns</h2>
			<p>So, what if you don't<a id="_idIndexMarker284"/> want to see all those system fields in your <strong class="bold">List</strong> view? What if you want to see some of your custom fields displayed instead? Well, there's good news—the answer to both questions is: <em class="italic">You can!</em></p>
			<p>To control which columns appear in <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>your list, click on the <strong class="bold">+</strong> icon to the far right in the heading list. This will result in a dropdown showing all available fields for the list (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.8</em>). The system fields will be shown first, followed by any custom fields you have created toward the bottom. </p>
			<p>Not all custom field types are available to be used with the <strong class="bold">List</strong> at this time. However, most custom field types are already available. Be sure to scroll down to see all of the fields available. You will be able to rearrange the order of the columns on your list after you have added them to the list. </p>
			<p>To add or remove a field from the list view, simply click on or click off the checkbox. The result will be immediate as you click each box. You can see an overview of this in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.8_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.8 – Adding a column&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.8 – Adding a column</p>
			<p>Next, we will look at how to change the order of the columns.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-92"><a id="_idTextAnchor091"/>Changing the order of columns</h2>
			<p>To change the order of<a id="_idIndexMarker286"/> columns on your list, simply click on the<a id="_idIndexMarker287"/> icon to the left of the column name and drag the column to the right or left. You will not be able to move the initial column for the issue type. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-93"><a id="_idTextAnchor092"/>Resizing columns</h2>
			<p>As you add or <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>remove columns/fields, it might be evident that some columns are<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> displayed as wider than is desired. If that is the case, you can resize the width of the column by clicking on the line that separates the fields while in the header rows. This will highlight the line from top to bottom and you can slide it to the left or right to resize the column. Clicking outside of the line will set it. The following screenshot demonstrates how to resize a column:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.9_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.9 – Resizing a column&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.9 – Resizing a column</p>
			<p>Now that some formatting of the list has been accomplished, let's take a look at other capabilities. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-94"><a id="_idTextAnchor093"/>Inline editing</h2>
			<p>As we have <a id="_idIndexMarker290"/>already mentioned several times, having the ability to edit fields directly in a list is a huge improvement and should gain us lots of increased productivity. </p>
			<p>It should be noted upfront that you cannot directly change the issue type or the issue key from the <strong class="bold">List</strong> tool. To make a change to any value displayed on the screen, just click on the field, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.10_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.10 – Inline editing&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.10 – Inline editing</p>
			<p>Depending on the type<a id="_idIndexMarker291"/> of field, you will see an appropriate method to update the value. Clicking on a <strong class="bold">Data type</strong> field will immediately display a calendar function you can use to select a date. Clicking on a field with a list of values will provide a dropdown with available values (see <em class="italic">Figure 5.10</em> for an example of this). Clicking on user-related fields such as <strong class="bold">Assignee</strong> will display a list of users in your system who can be assigned to issues on this project. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor094"/>Filtering issues</h2>
			<p>As with any listing of<a id="_idIndexMarker292"/> items, it is often desired to limit the actual issues that appear in the list. To do that, we need to apply an additional filter to the list received. Without any filters supplied, your JWM project list will include all issues on that project. To add a filter, click on the <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> icon at the top, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.11_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.11 – Adding a filter to a list&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.11 – Adding a filter to a list</p>
			<p>As you click on the <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> icon, initially only the <strong class="bold">Assigned to me</strong>, <strong class="bold">Due this week</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Done items</strong> filters will appear. These are known as <strong class="bold">Quick Filters</strong> and provide a fast path to common filters. If you wish to search by additional fields, click on the <strong class="bold">More Filters</strong> option to see additional fields that can be used. Again, not all fields are currently available for searching/filtering. </p>
			<p>See <em class="italic">Figure 5.11</em> for an <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>example of adding other fields. Note that you can select multiple field options while in the <strong class="bold">Filter</strong> toolset. Each of these options will be cumulative, meaning that all of them will be used when you click the <strong class="bold">Apply</strong> button. </p>
			<p>The filter icon will display the number of filters currently being used. If you want to return to the original list of <strong class="bold">Quick Filters</strong>, click on the back arrow to the left of <strong class="bold">FILTER BY</strong>. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor095"/>Sorting issues</h2>
			<p>Finally, you can<a id="_idIndexMarker294"/> sort your list based on any column in your list. Clicking on the header will display an option to sort from <strong class="bold">A – Z</strong> or from <strong class="bold">Z – A</strong>, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.12_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.12 – Sorting a column&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.12 – Sorting a column</p>
			<p>Though it is something of a misnomer, it will have these two options even when clicking on a date field. Just realize that it will sort the list based on either the most recent date for <strong class="bold">A – Z</strong> and the farthest away date for <strong class="bold">Z – A</strong>. Unlike filters, sorting is not currently cumulative. So, the most recent sort you have chosen will be the only sort used. </p>
			<p>If you are using<a id="_idIndexMarker295"/> sub-tasks in your project, the <strong class="bold">List</strong> view will show the proper indentation of those tasks under their related parent task so you can quickly tell which issues are of the <strong class="bold">Sub-task</strong> type. Next, we will turn our attention to the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> feature.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Working with the Timeline</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Roadmaps</strong> and <strong class="bold">Gantt-style views</strong> have long <a id="_idIndexMarker296"/>been missing from standard subscriptions in the<a id="_idIndexMarker297"/> Jira family of products. But in the last couple of years, Atlassian has made a concerted effort to bring this functionality to the masses. </p>
			<p>First, we saw a simple <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>roadmap appear with team-based software projects. Then came <strong class="bold">Advanced Roadmaps</strong>, which span multiple projects but are only available under a <em class="italic">Premium subscription</em>. And now, we see the equivalent in JWM projects under the name of <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>. </p>
			<p>Though it was the last of the features to come out with JWM, it has quickly gained traction and has much of the functionality you would expect with this type of tool. You can drag starting or ending points of issues to increase their length of time, you can add dependencies between issues, and—of course—you can export and share your timelines with others. </p>
			<p>To access the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>, simply click on<a id="_idIndexMarker299"/> the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> menu option on the left, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.13_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.13 – The Timeline&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.13 – The Timeline</p>
			<p>Now, let's have a look at how to change durations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Changing durations</h2>
			<p>As with any <a id="_idIndexMarker300"/>timeline or Gantt-style view, you will need to have start and end dates associated with your issue. JWM projects use the <strong class="bold">Start date</strong> field for the initiation of work on an issue and the <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> field for the end date when work should be completed. </p>
			<p>To adjust the date ranges of your issue while in the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> view, click on the rectangular box associated with the issue at either the beginning (to change the start date) or the end of the box (to change the end date) and drag accordingly. Be sure to click on one of the slender handles that appear at the end of the box. </p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can click on the <strong class="bold">Issue</strong> key to enter the full edit mode of the issue. There, you can change the <strong class="bold">Start date</strong> or <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> fields (or both). This will result in a graphical display of the issue to either lengthen or shorten, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.14_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.14 – Changing dates and durations&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Dependencies</h2>
			<p>No timeline <a id="_idIndexMarker301"/>or roadmap would be complete without the ability to add dependencies between items of work. This is a simple procedure in JWM. Just click on one of the dots that appear at the ends of the issue as you hover over it, and then drag the dot on top of another issue. </p>
			<p>The result will be a curved line connecting the end of one issue to the beginning of another issue, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.15_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.15 – Timeline dependencies&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.15 – Timeline dependencies</p>
			<p>The timeline is <a id="_idIndexMarker302"/>intuitive enough to know which end you are dragging from to create the right type of dependency.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Timeline filters</h2>
			<p>Filters for<a id="_idIndexMarker303"/> timelines work exactly as they do for lists. See <em class="italic">Figure 5.11</em> and the surrounding descriptions of how filters work.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>Exporting a timeline</h2>
			<p>It is often desirable<a id="_idIndexMarker304"/> to export timelines so that they can be added to presentations for stakeholder updates and general status inquiries. Simply click on the <strong class="bold">Export</strong> button to display the following screen: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.16_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.16 – Exporting a timeline&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.16 – Exporting a timeline</p>
			<p>At this point, you<a id="_idIndexMarker305"/> can change the view of your timeline based on a view of weeks, months, or quarters. You can also identify the initial start date to exclude any issues starting before that date. You can do the same with the end date. Remember that the <strong class="bold">End date</strong> value is actually the <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> value of the issue. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Sharing a timeline</h2>
			<p>Outside of fully exporting a<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> timeline, you can do a simple share of the <strong class="bold">Uniform Resource Locator</strong> (<strong class="bold">URL</strong>) for the<a id="_idIndexMarker307"/> timeline and send it directly to an existing Jira user, a Jira team, or an outside email address. Add a message if you like and click the <strong class="bold">Send</strong> button, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.17_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.17 – Sharing a timeline&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.17 – Sharing a timeline</p>
			<p>The user will receive an email <a id="_idIndexMarker308"/>with a link to the timeline. Clicking the <strong class="bold">Timeline</strong> link in the email or the <strong class="bold">View</strong> button will take the user directly to your shared timeline. </p>
			<p>For our final trip through the JWM features in this chapter, let's take a look at the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> feature. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Adding issues to the Calendar</h1>
			<p>Up<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> until now, having a <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> view of your project's<a id="_idIndexMarker310"/> issues required using a third-party Marketplace app or adding the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> gadget to a dashboard. Either way, you could not see the calendar from directly inside your project. The <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> was one of the first features to be added to JWM and provided an immediate lift in functionality not found in other Jira products. </p>
			<p>To date, the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> is still fairly simple, with little flexibility in how issues are displayed. But the simple fact that you can access it directly in the project makes it super helpful, and we expect the JWM development team at Atlassian to continue to produce new functionality. To display the calendar, click on the <strong class="bold">Calendar</strong> menu option on the left, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.18_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.18 – The Calendar&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.18 – The Calendar</p>
			<p>The main driver to <a id="_idIndexMarker311"/>determine where on the calendar that issue will be <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>displayed is the <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> field. The issue will appear on the calendar on the date associated with that field. If no filters are applied, you will see all issues in your project displayed on the calendar for any issues with a value in the <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> field. If the <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> field is not populated, the issue will not show on the calendar. </p>
			<p>You can navigate to other months by clicking the left or right arrows adjacent to the name of the month and year. To return to the current month, simply click on the <strong class="bold">Today</strong> button. As with the previously explained filter functionality, see <em class="italic">Figure 5.11</em> and the surrounding descriptions to learn how to add filters. </p>
			<p>Our last bit of functionality gives you the ability to create new issues directly from the calendar—the <strong class="bold">Create issue</strong> dialog box, as illustrated in the following screenshot: </p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_5.19_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 5.19 – Calendar: Create issue dialog box&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 5.19 – Calendar: Create issue dialog box</p>
			<p>To open<a id="_idIndexMarker313"/> the <strong class="bold">Create issue</strong> dialog box, double-click on one of the dates in <a id="_idIndexMarker314"/>the calendar. As the dialog box opens, it will automatically have the <strong class="bold">Due date</strong> field populated with the value of the date you double-clicked on. </p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>New terms learned in this chapter</h1>
			<p>Let's conclude the chapter by going through the list of new terms learned in this chapter, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Summary</strong>: The <strong class="bold">Summary</strong> section <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>of a JWM project that shows statistics and activities that have been happening in your project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">List</strong>: A list<a id="_idIndexMarker316"/> of all issues on your JWM project. It includes inline editing.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Board</strong>: A Kanban-style <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>view of your issues, presented as cards.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Calendar</strong>: A calendar<a id="_idIndexMarker318"/> view of your issues, including interactive links allowing you direct access to the issue. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Timeline</strong>: A roadmap or <a id="_idIndexMarker319"/>Gantt-style view of the issues in your project. </li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Forms</strong>: A simple interactive <a id="_idIndexMarker320"/>screen allowing entry of fields when creating an issue.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>I hope you are as excited as I am about the rebranding of Jira Core Cloud to JWM and the new features that are now available. Being able to not just view your issues in different formats but also interact with and make modifications to them is a real game-changer. </p>
			<p>In this chapter, we have learned which new features have been deployed with JWM projects and how to access each feature, and we became familiar with how our items of work (issues) are related to each feature—their display and relationship. We saw how statistics related to the project can be seen as groupings of fields such as <strong class="bold">Issue type</strong> and <strong class="bold">Priority</strong>.</p>
			<p>We also took the opportunity to do a deep dive into each component to further understand the functionality of each one and how to filter down issues when viewing each feature. </p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will continue exploring the features that come with JWM projects, including <strong class="bold">Forms</strong>. We will also learn how to create and run dashboards and reports and how to interact with issues in a more detailed manner.</p>
