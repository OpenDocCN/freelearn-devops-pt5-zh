    and what it actually is.
  prefs: []

- en: Docker Machine's biggest strength was that it provided a consistent interface
    to several public cloud providers, such as **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**),
    **DigitalOcean**, **Microsoft Azure**, and **Google Cloud**, as well as self-hosted
    VM/cloud platforms (including **OpenStack** and **VMware vSphere**) to quickly
    launch and configure individual Docker hosts. Being able to target all of these
    technologies using a single command with minimal user interaction is a very big-time
    saver. If you need to quickly access a Docker host in AWS one day and then in
    DigitalOcean the next, you know you are going to get a consistent experience.

    for Mac— however, this has been dropped from recent releases. This is due to there
    being less of a requirement for end users to launch and manage individual Docker

    or using a cloud provider's native Docker-based hosted tools, all of which we

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this chapter, we looked at how to use Docker Machine to create Docker hosts
    locally on VirtualBox and reviewed the commands you can use to both interact with
    and manage your Docker Machine-launched Docker hosts. We then looked at how to
    use Docker Machine to deploy Docker hosts to a cloud environment—namely, **DigitalOcean**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also discussed why using Docker Machine may also not be a great idea, depending
    on the age of your host machine. Because of this, we also discussed how to launch
    and configure a local Docker host using both **Vagrant** and **Multipass**.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In later chapters, we are going to move away from interacting with a single
    Docker host and move on to launching and running multiple Docker hosts. However,
    before we do so, we are first going to move away from Linux-based containers and
    take a whistle-stop tour of Windows containers in the next chapter. Don't worry
    if you don't have a Windows-based host, as we will be using Vagrant to launch
    one.
