<p class="mce-root"><em>Jira Quick Start Guide</em> is focused on getting you started with Jira very quickly, and is written specially with this objective in mind. Like any other tool, Jira also has a learning curve, but quite often, you don't want to spend weeks or even months just evaluating the product. This book will give you sufficient knowledge of using the tool not just as a user, but also as an administrator. The book starts by giving you a very good overview of Jira and how it can help you, then talks about Jira basics that will help you understand how it can be applied in your project. Later chapters are focused on exploring the customization capabilities of Jira to empower you with the knowledge of various schemes that cannot be ignored if you want to use Jira for your project.</p>
