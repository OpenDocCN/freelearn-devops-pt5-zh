<h1 id="_idParaDest-130"><a id="_idTextAnchor131"/>Mastering Dynamic Contents</h1>
<p>If you have decided to collect and organize all company information on Confluence, you will need to master some skills. The foremost of these is the ability to use dynamic pages effectively.</p>
<p>Pages whose content is automatically updated according to specific rules or contain rich content other than text and images are called dynamic pages. They interact with other pages on Confluence.</p>
<p>By making the pages dynamic, you can easily organize your knowledge base and find what you seek. Dynamic pages interact with other pages in the environment, and this way, you can reuse content from one page to another.</p>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn how to make static pages dynamic. You can be sure that what you learn here will greatly benefit you.</p>
<p>We will cover the following topics in this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labeling pages</li>
<li>Getting to know the macros</li>
<li>Exploring macros that use labels</li>
<li>Discovering macros that interact with pages</li>
<li>Adding more macros to Confluence</li>
<li>Discovering Smart Links</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-131"><a id="_idTextAnchor132"/>Technical requirements</h1>
<p>You will need the following software and requirements to complete this chapter:</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date web browser</li>
<li>An active subscription to Confluence Cloud Premium</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-132"><a id="_idTextAnchor133"/>Labeling pages</h1>
<p>You can add one or more labels to a Confluence page. With these labels, you can make the pages dynamic. In addition, thanks to the labels, you can effortlessly find the specific page you are looking for in an environment with hundreds or thousands of pages. For example, you can filter pages that have a specific label. You can also utilize filters while searching.</p>
<p>You can see the page’s labels at the bottom of that page. You can assign one or more previously created labels to the page. However, you can also add a brand new label to a page. When you do this, a new label is created. This label can also be used on other pages within your Confluence site. This way, your newly created label will be available for other spaces too.</p>
<p>We suggest that you follow these practices:</p>
<ul>
<li>Give multiple labels to each page.</li>
<li>Set a standard rule for naming the labels – for example, <code>my-first-label</code> or <code>my-second-label</code>.</li>
<li>Remember that there is no way to manage labels on Confluence, so we recommend choosing them carefully.</li>
<li>It is not practical to leave the responsibility of labeling pages to one person; doing this as a team is beneficial. You can ensure that all pages have at least one label.</li>
</ul>
<p>Labels can’t have any spaces, so if you add a space, it is automatically replaced by <code>-</code></p>
<p>Labels can be found at the bottom of a Confluence page. If no label has been given yet, you will only see the <strong class="bold">+ Add </strong><strong class="bold">label</strong> button:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_01_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.1 – Page labels (this page currently has no label)</p>
<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker402"/> can see, there are no labels on the page. Let’s click on the <strong class="bold">+ Add </strong><strong class="bold">label</strong> button.</p>
<p>You <a id="_idIndexMarker403"/>can easily add an existing label in the <strong class="bold">Labels</strong> section. It is also possible to create a new one:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_02_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.2 – Creating a new label</p>
<p>As you can see, Confluence allows you to save the new label that you entered, called <strong class="bold">my-first-label</strong>.</p>
<p>Note that you can enter multiple labels on a page, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_03_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.3 – Page labels</p>
<p>As you can see, this page has two labels – <strong class="bold">my-first-label</strong> and <strong class="bold">my-second-label</strong>.</p>
<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker404"/> section<a id="_idIndexMarker405"/> taught us about labels, an essential concept in Confluence. We learned to see labels on a page, add labels to a page, and create a new label. We also acknowledged how important effective label management is for the health of your Confluence environment. Now, it’s time to review the macros on Confluence. You will see that a significant number of these macros use labels.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-133"><a id="_idTextAnchor134"/>Getting to know macros</h1>
<p>Adding a macro is <a id="_idIndexMarker406"/>one of the most effective ways to make dynamic Confluence pages. By adding one or more macros to a page, we can make that page dynamic. In other<a id="_idIndexMarker407"/> words, macros serve to make pages much more resourceful. Confluence offers us many macros for different purposes. In this and the following sections, we’ll examine macros closely.</p>
<p>Adding a macro to a page is easy. First, we want to teach you this skill. Next, we’ll go over the macros one by one.</p>
<p>Let’s see how we can add a macro to a page following these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open the sample page we created in the previous section or create a new one.</li>
<li>Click the <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> button to switch to edit mode.</li>
<li>Click the <strong class="bold">+</strong> button on the far right of the top menu and look at the options. The screen<a id="_idIndexMarker408"/> should look like this:</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_04_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.4 – Inserting a macro</p>
<p>We can also type <code>/</code> on a page to find macros.</p>
<ol>
<li value="4">As you can see, many macros can be added to the page. Let’s see the macro list by clicking the <strong class="bold">View </strong><strong class="bold">more</strong> button.</li>
</ol>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_05_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.5 – A list of all the macros</p>
<ol>
<li value="5">As you<a id="_idIndexMarker409"/> can see, the list of macros you can add to the page is extensive and divided into eight categories. Press the <strong class="bold">Insert</strong> button to add the macro you chose for the page.</li>
</ol>
<p>After looking at our list of macros and learning how to add a macro to the page, we are now ready to review the macros individually. We will examine macros in two separate groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Macros that use labels</li>
<li>Macros that interact with pages</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-134"><a id="_idTextAnchor135"/>Exploring macros that use labels</h2>
<p>In the<a id="_idIndexMarker410"/> previous pages, we introduced the basics of making pages dynamic with labels. In this section, we will deep dive into this. Now, let’s go over the important macros that use labels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Related Labels</li>
<li>Content by Label</li>
<li>Labels List</li>
<li>Popular Labels</li>
<li>Content Report Table</li>
</ul>
<h3>Related Labels</h3>
<p>This <a id="_idIndexMarker411"/>macro fetches labels from other pages that share a label with the page the macro was added to. Thus, it allows you to list the related labels on your page.</p>
<p>You can see the output of this macro in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_06_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.6 – The Related Labels macro</p>
<p>As you can see, this simple macro lists labels that might be relevant to this page.</p>
<h3>Content by Label</h3>
<p>Using<a id="_idIndexMarker412"/> this macro, you can list all content (pages, blog posts, and attachments) with specific labels of your preference.</p>
<p>You can see the macro settings on the left side of the following screenshot. On the right side, you can preview the output of the macro.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_07_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.7 – Edit ‘Content by Label’ Macro</p>
<p>As you can<a id="_idIndexMarker413"/> see, adding a filter to this macro allows you to be more specific about the pages that will be listed. On the right, you can see how the macro will appear on the page. Sticking to the current settings, the following information will be shown for each page in the list:</p>
<ul>
<li>The space that the page is in</li>
<li>The page labels</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set which information will appear in the list this macro produces:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_08_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.8 – Configuring the Content by Label macro</p>
<p>Also, <strong class="bold">Excerpt Display</strong> has <a id="_idIndexMarker414"/>three drop-down options – <strong class="bold">none</strong>, <strong class="bold">simple</strong>, and <strong class="bold">rich</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">none</strong>: The list does not show any excerpt from pages</li>
<li><strong class="bold">simple</strong>: The list shows minimal excerpts from pages</li>
<li><strong class="bold">rich</strong>: The list shows a lot of excerpts from pages</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next screenshot, you can see what the screen output looks like when the <strong class="bold">Excerpt Display</strong> setting is set to <strong class="bold">none</strong>.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_09_B16861.jpg"/>

</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.9 – The output of the Content by Label macro</p>
<p>In the <a id="_idIndexMarker415"/>previous screenshot, we can see that pages with the <strong class="bold">my-first-label</strong> content from different spaces are listed here.</p>
<h3>Labels List</h3>
<p>With<a id="_idIndexMarker416"/> this macro, you can dynamically add a list of all labels to a page. You can see the settings of this macro in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_10_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.10 – The Labels List macro</p>
<p>As you<a id="_idIndexMarker417"/> can see, you can list labels solely in the space of the active page or all spaces on the page.</p>
<p>You can see what output this macro produces in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_11_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.11 – The output of the Labels List macro</p>
<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker418"/> macro sorts all the labels alphabetically. You can easily access the pages with the relevant label by clicking on them.</p>
<h3>Popular Labels</h3>
<p>With this <a id="_idIndexMarker419"/>macro, you can list the most popular labels on the Confluence site or a specific area on a page.</p>
<p>You can see the settings of this macro in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_12_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.12 – The Popular Labels macro</p>
<p>As you can<a id="_idIndexMarker420"/> see, listing the labels in the currently active space is possible. You also have the option to list the labels from the entire Confluence site.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_13_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.13 – Popular Labels</p>
<p>As seen in<a id="_idIndexMarker421"/> the preceding screenshot, the Popular Labels macro can format its output with two style options – <strong class="bold">List</strong> and <strong class="bold">Heat Map</strong>.</p>
<h3>Content Report Table</h3>
<p>You can <a id="_idIndexMarker422"/>use this macro to report pages with a specific label in a table.</p>
<p>The settings of this macro should look like this:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_14_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.14 – The Content Report Table macro</p>
<p>As you can see, it is <a id="_idIndexMarker423"/>possible to generate this report based on one label or more. You can see the output of this macro in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_15_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.15 – The output of the Content Report Table macro</p>
<p>As you can see, this <a id="_idIndexMarker424"/>report currently includes the name of the page, the creator, and the date it was last updated. By changing the settings of the macro, you can add additional columns and change the order of this list.</p>
<p>In this section, we’ve reviewed macros that use labels. Now, it’s time to examine the macros that interact with the pages.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-135"><a id="_idTextAnchor136"/>Discovering macros that interact with pages</h2>
<p>This<a id="_idIndexMarker425"/> section will explore macros that allow you to interact with other pages. The number of macros you can use for this purpose is quite large. Let’s now cover the six macros we think are the most important ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include Page</li>
<li>Children Display</li>
<li>Excerpt and Excerpt Include</li>
<li>Recently Updated</li>
<li>Recently Updated Dashboard</li>
<li>Table of Contents</li>
</ul>
<h3>Include Page</h3>
<p>Sometimes, you <a id="_idIndexMarker426"/>may need to reuse content from one page over and over on others. In this case, the Include Page macro will come in handy. With this macro, you can display a page inside another page.</p>
<p>There are two scenarios where this macro is very practical:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can reuse content from one page over and over on other pages. When a section that appears on several pages is changed on one page, you do not need to update individual pages that display that content. You can update the content from one place and only once, and all pages that show this content will be updated.</li>
<li>You can use this macro when you want a certain part of a page to be seen or modified only by authorized people, using page restrictions. You can create the section you want to hide as a separate page and embed this page inside the main page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Children Display</h3>
<p>Using this<a id="_idIndexMarker427"/> macro, you can list pages under a specific page.</p>
<p>You can see the settings of this macro in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_16_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.16 – The configuration parameters of the Children Display macro</p>
<p>As you can<a id="_idIndexMarker428"/> see, this macro has many settings. First, you need to select the page where you will list the child pages. If you skip this selection, the child pages where you placed the macro will be listed instead.</p>
<p>You can adjust the level of detail of the resulting list using settings such as the number of child pages and the depth of descendants. Thanks to the <strong class="bold">Excerpt Display</strong> setting, you can make the summary sections of the child pages in the list.</p>
<p>You can customize the list’s order and heading styles to wrap everything up.</p>
<h3>Excerpt and Excerpt Include</h3>
<p>Occasionally, you<a id="_idIndexMarker429"/> will want to reuse only a part of a page on another. In this case, there are two macros you can benefit from:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong class="bold">Excerpt</strong>: You can determine which part of a page will be reused using the Excerpt macro</li>
<li><strong class="bold">Excerpt Include</strong>: Using<a id="_idIndexMarker430"/> the Excerpt Include macro, you can bring the section you determined a step ago into the page</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, let’s get to know these two macros better.</p>
<p>You can see the settings page of the <strong class="bold">Excerpt</strong> macro in the following screenshot.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_17_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.17 – The Excerpt macro</p>
<p>As you can see, there <a id="_idIndexMarker431"/>are only two parts here. In the first part, we need to give this field a name. If you wish, you can activate the <strong class="bold">Hide Excerpted Content</strong> option so that this special region does not appear on the page. Note that this section will be visible in edit mode and hidden in view mode.</p>
<p>Let’s see what this macro looks like on a page:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_18_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.18 – The Excerpt macro on a page</p>
<p>As you can see in the previous screenshot, we selected the contents from a section of the page and named this section <code>important-section</code>. We will be able to access any content that we add in this section from another page.</p>
<p>Notably, you can add more than one Excerpt macro to a page.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time to look at the<a id="_idIndexMarker432"/> Excerpt Include macro. First, let’s discover the configuration parameters of this macro, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_19_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.19 – The configuration parameters of the Excerpt Include macro</p>
<p>As you can see, there are two sections on the configuration page of this macro. On the left section, firstly, it is necessary to specify the page from which we will draw a section. Then, you need to choose the excerpt name. In the right section, you can preview this macro’s output.</p>
<p>Once you activate the <strong class="bold">Remove border panel</strong> option, the section added to the page will appear as if it’s a part of that page. It won’t be noticeable that this section was brought from another page.</p>
<h3>Recently Updated</h3>
<p>This macro<a id="_idIndexMarker433"/> lets you dynamically generate a list of the latest updated content in your selected fields. You can see the settings of this macro in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_20_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.20 – Configuring the Recently Updated macro</p>
<p>There are<a id="_idIndexMarker434"/> many settings where you can customize the output of this macro. The most important setting to pay attention to is the list of spaces to monitor. If you don’t select any fields here, only the updated pages in the space of the page you inserted the macro into will be listed.</p>
<p>This macro can list many types of content, such as comments, not just the pages. Note that you can limit which types of content will be listed.</p>
<p>Also, you can filter the contents using labels.</p>
<p>The output of this macro is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_21_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.21 – The output of the Recently Updated macro</p>
<p>As you can see, this<a id="_idIndexMarker435"/> macro lists all recently updated content. The content’s title, the date it was updated, and the person who last edited it are displayed here.</p>
<h3>Recently Updated Dashboard</h3>
<p>This macro<a id="_idIndexMarker436"/> is a slightly more advanced version of the previous macro. Let’s look at the output of this macro, which will be significantly helpful when the number of people working in the Confluence environment increases:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_22_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.22 – The Recently Updated Dashboard output</p>
<p>As you can <a id="_idIndexMarker437"/>see, the listed content is organized by tabs. You can see the settings of this macro in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_23_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.23 – The configuration parameters of the Recently Updated Dashboard macro</p>
<p>The settings of this macro are very similar to the previous one. The difference is that you can specify which<a id="_idIndexMarker438"/> user’s updates you want to see.</p>
<h3>Table of Contents</h3>
<p>With this <a id="_idIndexMarker439"/>macro, which you will probably use frequently, you can add a dynamic table of contents to a page.</p>
<p>This macro has several settings; let’s examine them now.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_24_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.24 – The configuration parameters of the Table of Contents macro</p>
<p>You can see the first <a id="_idIndexMarker440"/>part of the settings page, which will help you to adjust how the dynamic content section will appear. You can also apply section numbering to the headings and set the structural properties of the table of contents in the following screenshot.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_25_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.25 – The configuration parameters of the Table of Contents macro (continued)</p>
<p>Also, note that<a id="_idIndexMarker441"/> it is possible to change the appearance of<a id="_idIndexMarker442"/> the table of contents using <strong class="bold">Cascading Style </strong><strong class="bold">Sheets</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSS</strong>):</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_26_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.26 – The output of the Table of Contents macro</p>
<p>As you can see, Confluence creates a dynamic table of contents based on the page titles.</p>
<p>In this section, we<a id="_idIndexMarker443"/> have examined the most critical macros that Confluence offers us. There are many more macros on Confluence than we’ve seen here, and we encourage you to explore them.</p>
<p>You may decide that the macros on Confluence are not enough for you; if so, you have options. In the next section, we’ll discuss adding new macros to Confluence.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-136"><a id="_idTextAnchor137"/>Adding macros to Confluence</h1>
<p>It is possible<a id="_idIndexMarker444"/> to add macros to Confluence. There are two ways to do this – the first is to add a macro through the Atlassian Marketplace, and the other is to develop your macro from scratch. In this section, we will share practical information about both options.</p>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-137"><a id="_idTextAnchor138"/>Adding macros via the Atlassian Marketplace</h2>
<p>You can<a id="_idIndexMarker445"/> find many Confluence macros on the Atlassian Marketplace, and you can upload the ones you like to your environment and start using them immediately. The following are a few recommendations that will be useful when evaluating macros:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that you trust the producer of the macro</li>
<li>Make sure that the macro is sufficient for information security</li>
<li>Atlassian puts so much effort into ensuring that the content on this platform is world-class, but remember – the primary responsibility here is yours</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor139"/>Develop a new macro</h2>
<p>You may <a id="_idIndexMarker446"/>want to develop your macro for various reasons. Maybe you couldn’t find such a macro on Marketplace, didn’t like the macros you found, or had reservations about information security. Whatever the reason, knowing you can develop your macro is reassuring.</p>
<p>Developing a new Confluence macro is beyond the scope of this book. However, we would like to share a few notes that will be useful:</p>
<ul>
<li>The essential information required to develop a macro is available on Atlassian’s websites</li>
<li>You can develop the macro yourself</li>
<li>The macro you develop needs to go beyond operating error-free; it must be world-class regarding information security</li>
<li>Remember that you will have to update the macro you develop constantly</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor140"/>Discovering Smart Links</h1>
<p>In<a id="_idIndexMarker447"/> this section, we will discuss Smart Links, a relatively new feature. Smart Links make integrating a Confluence page with other systems straightforward. By using Smart Links, viewing content from supported programs as if you were inside the Confluence page is possible. For example, you can safely add a Miro visual to a Confluence page. Smart Links allow you to work with other programs without using any plugins. They are also very effective in making Confluence pages dynamic if used well. This is why we recommend you experiment a lot with Smart Links.</p>
<p>Smart Links is a new feature. While there was no Smart Links feature, we used to use plugins downloaded from the Atlassian Marketplace or develop software from scratch for such integrations. Smart Links have largely made these plugins and software development efforts unnecessary.</p>
<p>Smart Links work on the following principle – when you add a link to a Confluence page, the content where that link goes is examined. If Atlassian supports the system hosting the content, that content can be viewed as if it were inside the Confluence page. Many problems related to this integration, especially information security, are solved thanks to Smart Links.</p>
<div><div><img alt="" src="img/Figure_05_27_B16861.jpg"/>
</div>
</div>
<p class="IMG---Caption" lang="en-US" xml:lang="en-US">Figure 5.27 – Embedding a Miro board into a Confluence page with a Smart Link</p>
<p>As seen in<a id="_idIndexMarker448"/> the preceding screenshot, Smart Links seem very simple, but they have a serious infrastructure behind them. Major platforms, such as Google Drive and Miro, are supported by Smart Links. Although it is unlikely, not all links you add may be supported by Smart Links. However, knowing that Atlassian is increasing the amount of systems supported by Smart Links is helpful. Behind Smart Links lies a fundamental feature of Confluence (and all Atlassian products) – Atlassian products emphasize safe and easy integration with other products.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor141"/>Summary</h1>
<p>In this chapter, we gained significant experience with Confluence. First, we talked about dynamic content. We’ve seen different ways to make pages dynamic. We learned the concept of labels, the purpose of labels, and how they are used. Then, we covered macros. We saw the basic logic of macros, and then we examined the selected macros individually. Finally, we discovered different ways to enrich Confluence’s rich macro library.</p>
