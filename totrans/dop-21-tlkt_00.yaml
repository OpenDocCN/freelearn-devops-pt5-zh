    It took me a long time to finish it. Much longer than I imagined.

- en: I started by writing blog posts in *TechnologyConversations.com* ([https://technologyconversations.com/](https://technologyconversations.com/)).
    They become popular and I received a lot of feedback. Through them, I clarified
    the idea behind the book. The goal was to provide a guide for those who want to
    implement DevOps practices and tools. At the same time, I did not want to write
    a material usable to any situation. I wanted to concentrate only on people that
    truly want to implement the latest and greatest practices. I hoped to make it
    go beyond the "traditional" DevOps. I wished to show that the DevOps movement
    matured and evolved over the years and that we needed a new name. A reset from
    the way DevOps is implemented in some organizations. Hence the name, *The DevOps
    2.0 Toolkit *([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M))

- en: As any author will tell you, technical books based mostly on hands-on material
    do not have a long time span. Technology changes ever so quickly and we can expect
    tools and practices that are valid today to become obsolete a couple of years
    afterward. I expected *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit* to be a reference for two to three
    years (not more). After all, how much can things change in one year? Well, Docker
    proved me wrong. A lot changed in only six months since I made the book public.
    The new Swarm was released. It is now part of *Docker Engine v1.12+*. Service
    discovery is bundled inside it. Networking was greatly improved with load balancing
    and routing mesh. The list can go on for a while. The release 1.12 is, in my opinion,
    the most significant release since the first version that went public.

    *DockerCon 2016*. Instead of attending the public sessions, I spent four days
    with them going through the features that will be released in version 1.12 and
    the roadmap beyond it. I felt I understood all the technical concepts and features
    behind them. However, a week later, when I went back home and started "playing"
    with the new *Docker Swarm Mode*, I realized that my brain was still wired to
    the way the things were working before. Too many things changed. Too many new
    possibilities emerged. It took a couple of weeks until my brain reset. Only then
    I felt I truly understood the scope of changes they introduced in a single release.
    It was massive.

    from *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit *([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M))
    readers. They wanted more. They wanted me to cover new topics as well as to go
    deeper into those already explored. One particular request was repeated over and
    over. "I want you to go deeper into clustering." Readers wanted to know in more
    detail how to operate a cluster and how to combine it with continuous deployment.
    They requested that I explore alternative methods for zero-downtime deployments,
    how to monitor the system more efficiently, how to get closer to self-healing
    systems, and so on. The range of topics they wanted me to cover was massive, and
    they wanted it as soon as possible.

    with some of the requests from the readers. *The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit* was born,
    and, more importantly, *The DevOps Toolkit Series* came into existence.

- en: This book explores the practices and tools required to run a Swarm cluster.
    We'll go beyond a simple deployment. We'll explore how to create a **Continuous
    Deployment** process. We'll set up multiple clusters. One will be dedicated to
    testing and the other for production. We'll see how to accomplish zero-downtime
    deployments, what to do in case of a failover, how to run services at scale, how
    to monitor the systems, and how to make it heal itself. We'll explore the processes
    that will allow us to run the clusters on a laptop (for demo purposes) as well
    as on different providers. I'll try to cover as many different hosting solutions
    as possible. However, time and space are limited, and the one you use (be it public
    or on-premise) might not be one of them. Fear not! The processes, the tools, and
    the practices can be easily applied to almost any. As always, this book is very
    hands-on oriented, but the goal is not to master a particular set of tools but
    to learn the logic behind them so that you can apply it to your job no matter
    whether your choice ends up being different.

- en: This book does not make *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit* ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M))obsolete.
    I think that the logic behind it will continue being valid for a while longer.
    *The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit* builds on top of it. It goes deeper into some of the
    subjects explored before and explains others that could not fit in *2.0*. While
    I did my best to write this book in a way that prior knowledge is not required,
    I strongly recommend starting with *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit* ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)).
    The first book in the series sets the stage for this one as well as those that
    will come afterward. Please consider this book as the second episode in *The DevOps
    Toolkit Series*. The first few chapters might, on the first look, seem repetitive
    to the readers of *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*. Never the less, they are important
    because they unravel some of the problems we'll face when working inside a cluster.
    They set the stage for the chapters that follow. While you might be tempted to
    skip them, my recommendation is to read everything. As in any good story, the
    start sets the stage, the middle develops the story, and the end reveals an unexpected
    outcome. Some of the theory will be the same as described in *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*.
    In such cases, I will clearly indicate it and let you choose whether to skip it
    or read it as a way to refresh your memory.

    to complete it by reading it in a metro on the way to work. You'll have to read
    this book while in front of a computer getting your hands dirty. Eventually, you
    might get stuck and in need of help. Or you might want to write a review or comment
    on the book's content. Please post your thoughts on *The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit channel

- en: Please note that this, just as the previous book, is self-published. I believe
    that having no intermediaries between the writer and the reader is the best way
    to go. It allows me to write faster, update the book more frequently, and have
    a more direct communication with you. Your feedback is part of the process. No
    matter whether you purchased the book while only a few or all chapters were written,
    the idea is that it will never be truly finished. As time passes, it will require
    updates so that it is aligned with the change in technology or processes. When
    possible, I will try to keep it up to date and release updates whenever that makes
    sense. Eventually, things might change so much that updates are not a good option
    anymore, and that will be a sign that a whole new book is required. *As long as
    I continue getting your support, I will keep writing***.**

    combined with continuous deployment and containers. Due to the very broad scope,
    target audience could be *architects* who want to know how to design their systems
    around microservices. It could be *DevOps* wanting to know how to apply modern
    configuration management practices and continuously deploy applications packed
    in containers. It is for *developers* who would like to take the process back
    into their hands as well as for *managers* who would like to gain a better understanding
    of the process used to deliver software from the beginning to the end. We'll speak
    about scaling and monitoring systems. We'll even work on the design (and implementation)
    of self-healing systems capable of recuperation from failures (be it of hardware
    or software nature). We'll deploy our applications continuously directly to production
    without any downtime and with the ability to rollback at any time.
