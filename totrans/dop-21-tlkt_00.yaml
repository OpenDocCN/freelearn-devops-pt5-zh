- en: At the beginning of 2016, I published *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit *([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)).
    It took me a long time to finish it. Much longer than I imagined.

  zh: 2016年初，我发布了*The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*（[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)）。完成它花费了我很长时间，比我预想的要长得多。
- en: I started by writing blog posts in *TechnologyConversations.com* ([https://technologyconversations.com/](https://technologyconversations.com/)).
    They become popular and I received a lot of feedback. Through them, I clarified
    the idea behind the book. The goal was to provide a guide for those who want to
    implement DevOps practices and tools. At the same time, I did not want to write
    a material usable to any situation. I wanted to concentrate only on people that
    truly want to implement the latest and greatest practices. I hoped to make it
    go beyond the "traditional" DevOps. I wished to show that the DevOps movement
    matured and evolved over the years and that we needed a new name. A reset from
    the way DevOps is implemented in some organizations. Hence the name, *The DevOps
    2.0 Toolkit *([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M))

  zh: 我从在*TechnologyConversations.com*（[https://technologyconversations.com/](https://technologyconversations.com/)）上写博客文章开始。这些文章很受欢迎，我收到了很多反馈。通过这些反馈，我阐明了书籍背后的理念。目标是为那些想要实施DevOps实践和工具的人提供一本指南。同时，我并不想写一本适用于所有情况的材料。我只想专注于那些真正想要实施最新最佳实践的人。我希望让它超越“传统”的DevOps。我希望展示DevOps运动在多年中成熟与演化，我们需要一个新的名称。是时候重置某些组织中DevOps的实施方式了。因此才有了书名*The
    DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*（[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)）。
- en: As any author will tell you, technical books based mostly on hands-on material
    do not have a long time span. Technology changes ever so quickly and we can expect
    tools and practices that are valid today to become obsolete a couple of years
    afterward. I expected *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit* to be a reference for two to three
    years (not more). After all, how much can things change in one year? Well, Docker
    proved me wrong. A lot changed in only six months since I made the book public.
    The new Swarm was released. It is now part of *Docker Engine v1.12+*. Service
    discovery is bundled inside it. Networking was greatly improved with load balancing
    and routing mesh. The list can go on for a while. The release 1.12 is, in my opinion,
    the most significant release since the first version that went public.

  zh: 正如任何作者会告诉你的那样，基于实际操作的技术书籍不会有很长的生命周期。技术变化得如此之快，我们可以预见今天有效的工具和实践在几年后会变得过时。我预计*The
    DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*会成为两到三年的参考书（不会超过这个时间）。毕竟，一年内变化能有多大呢？嗯，Docker让我错了。自从我公开出版这本书以来，短短六个月内就发生了巨大的变化。新的Swarm发布了，它现在是*Docker
    Engine v1.12+*的一部分。服务发现已被集成其中。网络功能得到了极大改善，支持负载均衡和路由网格。这些变化只是其中的一部分。我认为1.12版本的发布，是自第一版公开发布以来最具意义的一次。
- en: I remember the days I spent together with Docker engineers in Seattle during
    *DockerCon 2016*. Instead of attending the public sessions, I spent four days
    with them going through the features that will be released in version 1.12 and
    the roadmap beyond it. I felt I understood all the technical concepts and features
    behind them. However, a week later, when I went back home and started "playing"
    with the new *Docker Swarm Mode*, I realized that my brain was still wired to
    the way the things were working before. Too many things changed. Too many new
    possibilities emerged. It took a couple of weeks until my brain reset. Only then
    I felt I truly understood the scope of changes they introduced in a single release.
    It was massive.

  zh: 我记得在*DockerCon 2016*期间，我与Docker工程师们一起度过的日子。那时，我没有参加公开的会议，而是与他们一起花了四天时间，深入了解将要在1.12版本中发布的功能以及未来的路线图。我觉得自己完全理解了这些功能背后的技术概念。然而，一周后，当我回到家并开始“玩”新版本的*Docker
    Swarm模式*时，我才意识到我的大脑仍然依赖于旧有的工作方式。许多东西发生了变化，出现了许多新的可能性。过了几周，我的大脑才开始重置。直到那时，我才感觉自己真正理解了他们在一次发布中所引入的变化范围。那是一次巨大的变革。
- en: In parallel with my discovery of the Swarm Mode, I continued receiving emails
    from *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit *([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M))
    readers. They wanted more. They wanted me to cover new topics as well as to go
    deeper into those already explored. One particular request was repeated over and
    over. "I want you to go deeper into clustering." Readers wanted to know in more
    detail how to operate a cluster and how to combine it with continuous deployment.
    They requested that I explore alternative methods for zero-downtime deployments,
    how to monitor the system more efficiently, how to get closer to self-healing
    systems, and so on. The range of topics they wanted me to cover was massive, and
    they wanted it as soon as possible.

  zh: 与我对 Swarm Mode 的发现同时，我继续收到来自*DevOps 2.0 工具包*（[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)）读者的电子邮件。他们想要更多。他们希望我涵盖新的主题，并深入探讨已经探索的内容。特别是一个请求被反复提及。“我希望你深入探讨集群。”读者们想要更详细地了解如何操作集群，以及如何与持续部署结合。他们要求我探索零停机部署的替代方法，如何更有效地监控系统，如何接近自愈系统，等等。他们希望我尽快涵盖的主题范围非常广泛。
- en: Hence, I decided to start a new book and combine my amazement with Docker 1.12
    with some of the requests from the readers. *The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit* was born,
    and, more importantly, *The DevOps Toolkit Series* came into existence.

  zh: 概述
- en: This book explores the practices and tools required to run a Swarm cluster.
    We'll go beyond a simple deployment. We'll explore how to create a **Continuous
    Deployment** process. We'll set up multiple clusters. One will be dedicated to
    testing and the other for production. We'll see how to accomplish zero-downtime
    deployments, what to do in case of a failover, how to run services at scale, how
    to monitor the systems, and how to make it heal itself. We'll explore the processes
    that will allow us to run the clusters on a laptop (for demo purposes) as well
    as on different providers. I'll try to cover as many different hosting solutions
    as possible. However, time and space are limited, and the one you use (be it public
    or on-premise) might not be one of them. Fear not! The processes, the tools, and
    the practices can be easily applied to almost any. As always, this book is very
    hands-on oriented, but the goal is not to master a particular set of tools but
    to learn the logic behind them so that you can apply it to your job no matter
    whether your choice ends up being different.

  zh: 本书探讨了运行 Swarm 集群所需的实践和工具。我们不仅仅局限于简单的部署。我们将探讨如何创建**持续部署**流程。我们将设置多个集群。其中一个专门用于测试，另一个用于生产。我们将看到如何实现零停机部署，在故障转移时应该怎么做，如何扩展运行服务，如何监控系统以及如何使其自愈。我们将探索允许我们在笔记本电脑上（用于演示目的）以及不同提供商上运行集群的过程。我将尽可能涵盖尽可能多的不同托管解决方案。然而，时间和空间有限，你所使用的（无论是公共的还是内部的）可能不在其中。不用担心！这些过程、工具和实践几乎可以应用到任何情况中。像往常一样，本书非常注重实践，但目标不是掌握特定工具集，而是学习其背后的逻辑，以便无论你的选择最终如何，都能将其应用到工作中去。
- en: This book does not make *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit* ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M))obsolete.
    I think that the logic behind it will continue being valid for a while longer.
    *The DevOps 2.1 Toolkit* builds on top of it. It goes deeper into some of the
    subjects explored before and explains others that could not fit in *2.0*. While
    I did my best to write this book in a way that prior knowledge is not required,
    I strongly recommend starting with *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit* ([https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)).
    The first book in the series sets the stage for this one as well as those that
    will come afterward. Please consider this book as the second episode in *The DevOps
    Toolkit Series*. The first few chapters might, on the first look, seem repetitive
    to the readers of *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*. Never the less, they are important
    because they unravel some of the problems we'll face when working inside a cluster.
    They set the stage for the chapters that follow. While you might be tempted to
    skip them, my recommendation is to read everything. As in any good story, the
    start sets the stage, the middle develops the story, and the end reveals an unexpected
    outcome. Some of the theory will be the same as described in *The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*.
    In such cases, I will clearly indicate it and let you choose whether to skip it
    or read it as a way to refresh your memory.

  zh: 本书并不会使*The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*（[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)）过时。我认为它背后的逻辑还会有效一段时间。*The
    DevOps 2.1 Toolkit*是基于它构建的。它深入探讨了一些之前已经讨论过的主题，并解释了其他一些无法包含在*2.0*中的内容。虽然我尽力以不需要
    prior knowledge 的方式编写本书，但我强烈建议你先阅读*The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*（[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01BJ4V66M)）。系列中的第一本书为本书以及之后的书籍打下了基础。请把这本书视为*The
    DevOps Toolkit 系列*的第二集。对于*The DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*的读者来说，前几章可能乍看之下有些重复。不过，它们是非常重要的，因为它们揭示了我们在集群内工作时会遇到的一些问题，并为接下来的章节做好了铺垫。尽管你可能会想跳过这些内容，但我建议你还是读完它们。就像任何好的故事一样，开头为故事定下基调，中间推动情节发展，而结局则揭示了出人意料的结果。部分理论内容与*The
    DevOps 2.0 Toolkit*中所述相同。在这种情况下，我会明确标明，并让你选择是跳过它还是通过阅读来刷新记忆。

    that having no intermediaries between the writer and the reader is the best way
    to go. It allows me to write faster, update the book more frequently, and have
    a more direct communication with you. Your feedback is part of the process. No
    matter whether you purchased the book while only a few or all chapters were written,
    the idea is that it will never be truly finished. As time passes, it will require
    updates so that it is aligned with the change in technology or processes. When
    possible, I will try to keep it up to date and release updates whenever that makes
    sense. Eventually, things might change so much that updates are not a good option
    anymore, and that will be a sign that a whole new book is required. *As long as
    I continue getting your support, I will keep writing***.**

    into their hands as well as for *managers* who would like to gain a better understanding
    of the process used to deliver software from the beginning to the end. We'll speak
    about scaling and monitoring systems. We'll even work on the design (and implementation)
    of self-healing systems capable of recuperation from failures (be it of hardware
    or software nature). We'll deploy our applications continuously directly to production
    without any downtime and with the ability to rollback at any time.
