To keep up with this, companies need to be able to move quickly and iterate frequently. Until a few years back, this was mainly true for software, but now we start to see the necessity to change infrastructures at similar speed. Going forward, we will need to change the infrastructure we run our software on at the speed of the software itself.</p><p>In this scenario, many technologies, such as software-defined everything (storage, network, compute, what have you), will be key, but those technologies need to be managed in an equally scalable way, and that way will be using Ansible and similar products.</p><p>Ansible is highly relevant today since, differently from competing products, it is agentless, allowing faster deployments, more security, and better auditability.</p><div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec1"/>What this book covers </h1></div></div></div><p>

<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec2"/>What you need for this book </h1></div></div></div><p>This book is written to work with all Linux distributions. Since it’s not practical to always give the same information for all possible distributions, the example commands are for Fedora on the controller machine and CentOS on the controlled machines, if not stated. Experienced users with other distributions will have no problem in translating the commands for their own preferred distribution.</p></div>
<div><div><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pf07lvl1sec3"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>The book is for developers and sysadmins who want to automate their organization’s infrastructure using Ansible 2. No prior knowledge of Ansible is required.</p></div>
