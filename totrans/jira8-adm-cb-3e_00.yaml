- en: Atlassian Jira is an enterprise-issue tracker system. One of its key strengths
    is its ability to adapt to the needs of the organization from the frontend user
    interface to provide a platform for third-party apps to extend its capabilities.
    However, understanding its flexibility and picking the right apps can often be
    a daunting task for many administrators. Learning how to take advantage of Jira's
    power while keeping the overall design simple and clean is important to the success
    of the implementation and future growth.
