  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When Docker was first released, there was a lot of talk about Docker versus
    virtual machines. I remember reading articles in magazines, commenting on threads
    on Reddit, and reading endless blog posts. In the early days of the Docker alpha
    and beta versions, people used to approach Docker containers like virtual machines,
    because there weren't really any other points of reference, and we viewed them
    as tiny VMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In the past, I would enable SSH, run multiple processes in containers, and even
    create my container images by launching a container and running the commands to
    install my software stack. We discussed in [*Chapter 2*](B15659_02_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor068),
    *Building Container Images*, that you should never install, configure, and export
    SSH on your containers as it is regarded as a bad practice as Docker provides
    ways for you to access your containers without having to use SSH.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, rather than discussing containers versus virtual machines, let's look at
    some of the considerations that you need to make when running containers, rather
    than virtual machines.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The advantages
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you start a Docker container, Docker Engine does a lot of work behind the
    scenes. One of the tasks that Docker Engine performs when launching your containers
    is setting up namespaces and control groups. What does that mean? By setting up
    namespaces, Docker keeps the processes isolated in each container, not only from
    other containers but also from the host system. The control groups ensure that
    each container gets its own share of items, such as CPU, memory, and disk `I/O`.
    More importantly, they ensure that one container doesn't exhaust all of the resources
    on a given Docker host.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As we saw in [*Chapter 4*](B15659_04_Final_JM_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor133)*,
    Managing Containers*, being able to launch your containers in a Docker controlled
    network means that you can isolate your containers at the application level; all
    of the containers for Application A will not have any access, at the network layer,
    to the containers for Application B.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Additionally, this network isolation can run on a single Docker host by using
    the default network driver, or it can span multiple Docker hosts by using Docker
    Swarm's built-in, multi-host networking driver, or the Weave Net driver from Weave.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Lastly, what I consider one of the most significant advantages of Docker over
    a typical virtual machine is that you shouldn't have to log in to the container.
    Docker is trying its hardest to keep you from needing to log in to a container
    to manage the process that it is running. With commands such as `docker container
    exec`, `docker container top`, `docker container logs`, and `docker container
    stats`, you can do everything that you need to do, without exposing any more services
    than you have to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Your Docker hosts
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you are dealing with virtual machines, you can control who has access to
    which virtual machine. Let's suppose that you only want **User 1**, who is a developer,
    to have access to the development VMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, **User 2** is an operator who is responsible for both the development
    and production environments, so they need access to all of the VMs. Most virtual
    machine management tools allow you to grant role-based access to your VMs.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With Docker, you are at a slight disadvantage because everyone who has access
    to Docker Engine on your host, either through being granted sudo access or by
    having their user added to the Docker Linux group, will have access to every Docker
    container that you are running on that host.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They can run new containers, they can stop existing containers, and they can
    delete images as well. Be careful to whom you grant permission to access Docker
    Engine on your hosts. They mostly hold the keys to the kingdom, concerning all
    of your containers. Knowing this, it is recommended to use Docker hosts only for
    Docker; keep other services separate from your Docker hosts.

- en: Image trust
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are running virtual machines, you will most likely be setting them up
    yourself, from scratch. It's likely that, due to the size of the download (and
    also the effort in launching it), you will not download a prebuilt machine image
    that some random person on the internet created. Typically, if you were to do
    this, it would be a prebuilt virtual appliance from a trusted software vendor.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So, you will be aware of what is inside the virtual machine and what isn't,
    as you were responsible for building and maintaining it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Part of the appeal of Docker is its ease of use; however, this ease of use can
    make it easy to ignore a quite crucial security consideration – do you know what
    it is running inside your container?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have already touched upon image trust in earlier chapters. For example, we
    spoke about not publishing or downloading images that haven't been defined using
    Dockerfiles, and not embedding custom code or secrets (and so on) directly into
    an image that you will be pushing to Docker Hub.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While containers have the protection of namespaces, control groups, and network
    isolation, we discussed how a poorly judged image download could introduce security
    concerns and risk into your environment. For example, a legitimate container running
    an unpatched piece of software can add risk to the availability of your application
    and data.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    commands that can be used to help tighten up security, as well as to view information

    container diff` command, which you can use to view what has been done with the
    image that you are planning to use.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With respect to the `docker run` command, we will mainly focus on the option
    that allows you to set everything inside the container as read-only, instead of
    a specified directory or volume. This helps to limit the amount of damage that
    can be caused by malicious "applications" that could also hijack a vulnerable
    application by updating its binaries.

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Similar to the previous command, with `docker container run`, where we set everything
    to read-only (except for a specified volume), we can do the opposite and set just
    a single volume (or more, if you use more `-v` switches) to read-only.
  prefs: []

    it in a container, it will mount as an empty volume over the top of the directory

    a look at some of the things that you must consider when running containers (versus
    typical virtual machines) with regard to security. We looked at the advantages
    and your Docker host, and then we discussed image trust. We then took a look at
    the Docker commands that we can use for security purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We launched a read-only container so that we could minimize any potential damage
    an intruder could do within our running containers. As not all "applications"
    lend themselves to running in read-only containers, we then looked at how we can
    track changes that have been made to the image since it was launched. It is always
    useful to be able to easily discover any changes that were made on the filesystem
    at runtime when trying to look into any problems.

    We then analyzed the output to see what it meant. Remember the seven items that

    the Docker daemon configuration files, the container images and build files, the
    container runtime, the Docker security operations, and the Docker Swarm configuration.'
