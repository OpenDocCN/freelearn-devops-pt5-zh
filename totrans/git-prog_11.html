    <h1 id="_idParaDest-173" class="chapterTitle">Finding a Broken Commit: Bisect and Blame</h1>
    <p class="normal">Sooner or later, you are likely to find that you have a bug in your program that was introduced sometime in the past. You can go searching through all your prior commits, but that is time consuming and inefficient. Git provides a command, bisect, to take care of all the hard work for you.</p>
    <p class="normal">Here's how it works: bisect asks you for a known "bad" commit. Most often this is the last commit. It then asks for a known "good" commit â€“ that is, a commit that is known to work. You do not have to try out a variety of commits to find this; just far back enough that you can be sure it was working back then.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you are cautious, you may want to check out the good commit and run it just to make sure.</p>
    <p class="normal">Bisect will then do a series of binary searches looking to find the first bad commit. If you have good unit tests, bisect can do this on its own; otherwise you must test each commit it finds and report whether it is good or bad.</p>
    <p class="normal">You begin by entering <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">git bisect start</code>. This enters the bisect state, not unlike the way we might enter the rebase state.</p>
    <p class="normal">Your second command is to tell bisect that the current commit is broken (not working, or in bisect's terminology, <em class="italic">bad</em>). You indicate this by entering <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">git bisect bad</code>.</p>
    <p class="normal">You now need to tell bisect a good checkout. You can do this in one of two ways: either give it the ID of a good commit, or tell it how many commits to go back from the current, for example <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">git checkout HEAD~12</code>, indicating that we know that things were working twelve commits ago.</p>
    <p class="normal">Git will divide the remaining commits roughly in half, and check out a commit. Let's say that this is the commit made six commits prior to the current one. You then test that commit and tell bisect if it is good or bad.</p>
    <p class="normal">If you say it is good, that means that every commit before it is good. If you say it is bad, that means that every commit after it is bad. Let's assume commit 6 is good. Bisect will now consider its range to be 6 to 12 and might check out commit 9. </p>
    <p class="normal">You test commit 9 and find that it is bad. That means that every commit after 9 is bad. Bisect now has a range of 6 to 9 and checks out 7. If 7 is good then the bad commit is either 8 or 9. We test 8 and get the answer: if it is good then 9 is the first bad commit, otherwise it is 8.</p>
    <p class="normal">All of this is much easier to see with an example. Let's create a new repository called <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">BisectTest</code>:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_01.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.1: The repo to demonstrate bisect</p>
    <p class="normal">Now, clone that repository to your local disk as we've done before. To demonstrate how this works, we're going to create 12 commits, with one in the middle that has an error that will propagate until someone notices that the program is broken after checking in commit 12. "Oh no," we can hear that programmer cry, "this could have been broken for a long time, with no one noticing. I need to use bisect to find out which commit was bad and fix it."</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's use our tried-and-true <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Calculator</code> class to create 12 commits. The first will just create the project:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_02.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.2: The beginning of our program</p>
    <p class="normal">We'll save and commit that as our first commit:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_03.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.3: Save and commit</p>
    <p class="normal">Next we'll create the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Calculator</code> class and commit that:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">namespace BisectTest
{
    public class Calculator
    {
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">That makes three commits: the initial commit created when you cloned it, the commit after creating the program, and this commit after creating the <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Calculator</code> class:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_04.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.4: The three commits</p>
    <p class="normal">Now we'll add the four functions (add, subtract, multiply, and integer division) and commit after each one. After doing so, we have seven commits.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's add the modulus operator, real division, and square root, committing after each one.</p>
    <p class="normal">That gives us ten commits. Next, we'll go back to the program and use the calculator to print out the value of 23/4 using integer division, which gives us the value 5. Let's check that in.</p>
    <p class="normal">Next, we'll use the modulus operator on the same division:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">namespace BisectTest
{
    public static class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var calculator = new Calculator();
            Console.WriteLine($"Integer division of 23/4 is {calculator.Divide(23, 4)}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Modulus 23%4 is {calculator.Modulus(23, 4)}");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Finally, we'll divide using doubles:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
namespace BisectTest
{
    public static class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var calculator = new Calculator();
            Console.WriteLine($"Integer division of 23/4 is {calculator.Divide(23, 4)}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Modulus 23%4 is {calculator.Modulus(23, 4)}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Real division of 23/4 is {calculator.Divide(23.0, 4.0)}");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Okay, we're ready to show off our results at the next code review. We run the program and we get:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">Integer division of 23/4 is 5
Modulus 23%4 is 5
Real division of 23/4 is 5.75
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">That result can't be right. Now, in this case, the problem is obvious; our modulus operator is off. But in the real world, the answer will be far less obvious, let alone where it was introduced.</p>
    <p class="normal">Let's use bisect to find the commit where we went wrong. We start up bisect, and then we tell it that the current commit is bad:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_05.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.5: Starting bisect</p>
    <p class="normal">Now we need to tell it a good commit. Let's look at the log:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_06.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.6: Looking for the good commit</p>
    <p class="normal">We know that the second commit was good because all we did was create the project. Let's tell that to bisect:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_07.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.7: A known good commit</p>
    <p class="normal">You may get a lot of warnings about having a detached head (ouch). You can safely ignore those warnings. For form's sake, we'll test the currently checked-out commit and of course, it is fine. So we tell bisect that the current checkout is good:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_08.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.8: Telling Bisect this commit is good</p>
    <p class="normal">It comes back with some interesting information. It tells you that if the original commit was bad, and this one is good, then it has five revisions left to test, which will take roughly three steps. It also tells you that it checked out the commit whose message is "Add the divide function." Let's inspect the (now) current program and see if it is right. (Normally, here, you'd run the program to see if you get the expected result. Even better, you might run your suite of unit tests to see if it passes.)</p>
    <p class="normal">Looking in Visual Studio we see that the working directory looks like this:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">namespace BisectTest
{
    public class Calculator
    {
        public int Add(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
        public int Subtract(int x, int y)
        {
            return x + y;
        }
        public int Multiply(int x, int y)
        {
            return x * y;
        }
        public int Divide(int x, int y)
        {
            return x / y;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Looks good. Note that some functions are missing, and that is because bisect checked out an earlier commit. We can tell bisect that this commit is good:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_09.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.9: Another good commit</p>
    <p class="normal">It comes back and says that we've really narrowed things down. There are only two revisions left to test. Look at the original log:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_10.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.10: The repo to demonstrate bisect</p>
    <p class="normal">We told it that the latest is bad and the second is good. We then were offered the commit whose message is "Add the divide function." That is, bisect cut our list of commits roughly in half and checked out a commit for us to test. We told bisect that the commit it had us try was good. So, Bisect thinks, "Hmm. Divide is good, and real division is bad, so let's cut it in half (giving us "Add square root") and see if that is good or bad. Either way, we only have one more test to get the final answer."</p>
    <p class="normal">When we try the code, it is bad; it does not work in the expected way. So, let's tell Bisect that square root is bad. In response, it checks out "Add real division." Look again at the log. Either this one is bad or the one below it is bad. We've already told itÂ that "Add the divide function" is good, and we've already told it that the square root commit is bad:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_11.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.11: Honing in on the problem</p>
    <p class="normal">It has checked out "Add the divide function" so let's test that.</p>
    <p class="normal">That one is bad, so we'll tell bisect that:</p>
    <figure class="mediaobject"><img src="img/B17441_11_12.png" alt=""/></figure>
    <p class="packt_figref">Figure 11.12: We have found the problem</p>
    <p class="normal">It comes back and tells us that "Add modulus operator" must be the culprit and that there is nothing more to test. We've got it. Let's look â€“ sure enough, the modulus operator is using the divide operator instead:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">public int Modulus(int x, int y)
 {
     return x / y;
 }
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Even though we had to use a simple and fake example, you can see how bisect narrows down the commits to find the first one that went bad. Now that we know what is wrong, we can fix it.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-174" class="title">Blame</h1>
    <p class="normal">This unfortunately-named command can be a great help in tracking down who made changes to <a id="_idIndexMarker269"/>your code, line by line. From there you can talk with the programmer and discover their intention, or provide an opportunity for correction.</p>
    <p class="normal">To open Blame in Visual Studio, right-click on a file and choose <strong class="screenText">Git</strong> and then <strong class="screenText">Blame</strong>. The file will open with a section on the left that will list who made the edit to that line of code.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-175" class="title">Challenge</h1>
    <p class="normal">Create a program with twenty commits. Put an error in one of the early commits that won't break <a id="_idIndexMarker270"/>the working program (so that it can be hidden). Use bisect to find the error.</p>
    <p class="normal">The first step is to create a program with 20 commits. I decided to create a program that holds information about a book:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">namespace BisectTest
{
    public class Book
    {
        public string Author { get; set; }
        public string BookName { get; set; }
        public double Price { get; set; }
        public double DiscountPrice { get; set; }
        internal double WholeSalePrice { get; set; }
        internal double DiscontinuedPrice { get; set; }
        public void ComputePrice()
        {
            Price = WholeSalePrice + (WholeSalePrice * .5);         
        }
        public void ComputeDiscountPrice()
        {
            DiscountPrice = Price * 2;
        }
        public void ComputeDiscontinued()
        {
            DiscontinuedPrice = DiscontinuedPrice * 0.8;
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">We also <a id="_idIndexMarker271"/>have a program that interacts with our book class and displays the results:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting code"><code class="hljs-code">using System;
namespace BisectTest
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            var book = new Book();
            book.Author = "Jesse Liberty";
            book.BookName = "Pro Git for Programmers";
            book.WholeSalePrice = 10.0;
            book.ComputePrice();
            Console.WriteLine($"{book.BookName} by {book.Author}" );
            Console.WriteLine($"{book.BookName}: {book.Price}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Discount price is {book.DiscountPrice}");
            Console.WriteLine($"Discontinued price is {book.DiscontinuedPrice}");
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Let's run the program and examine the output:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">Pro Git for Programmers by Jesse Liberty
Pro Git for Programmers: 15
Discount price is 0
Discontinued price is 0
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">That is clearly not what we intended. Both the discount and the discontinued prices are 0, where they <a id="_idIndexMarker272"/>should be a fraction of 15. Oh! We forgot to call the method to compute the prices. When we do, and we display them all, we get this:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">Pro Git for Programmers by Jesse Liberty
Pro Git for Programmers: 15
Pro Git for Programmers discount price = 30
Discontinued price is 0
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Better, but still not right. Why is <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Discontinued</code> coming out to zero? To find this, we'll use bisect. To start we'll enter:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git bisect start
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Next, we need to tell Bisect that the current (most recent) commit is bad by entering:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">git bisect bad
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">Looking at the log, I see that the first commit has the ID <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">7259bb3</code>. So we'll enter:</p>
    <pre class="programlisting con"><code class="hljs-con">Git checkout 7259bb3
Git bisect good
</code></pre>
    <p class="normal">It checks out a version for me to test, and tells me that there are 11 revisions to test after this (assuming this is bad) and that it will take roughly 4 steps. We continue bisecting until we find the first instance of the broken code, as we saw above.</p>
