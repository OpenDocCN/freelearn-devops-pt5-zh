<p>The most important part of any IT system is data. Without data, applications and IT systems don't mean a thing. We discussed how to set up our applications in the IaaS and PaaS models, but how do we set up our databases?</p>
<p>In this chapter, we'll discuss database options and how to create environments that will host our databases.</p>
<p>W<span>e will cover the following topics:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machine</li>
<li><strong>Database as a Service</strong> (<strong><span>DaaS</span></strong>)</li>
<li>Azure SQL Database</li>

<p>Understanding database options in Azure is a very important part of our cloud journey. All services that we use must, in the end, store information somewhere. Microsoft Azure offers extensive data platforms and multiple services in which we can store data. We'll start with the <strong>relational database management system</strong> (<strong>RDBMS</strong>) as the most traditional database model, and we'll discuss cloud options for SQL Server as Microsoft's on-premises solution for RDBMS.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>To run SQL Server in Azure we have two different options—<span>IaaS</span> and <span>PaaS</span>. Database in <span>PaaS</span> is often referenced as <span>DaaS</span>. We'll explain both approaches and examine other services in Azure data platform.</p>

<p>Running SQL Server as <span>IaaS</span> requires creating an Azure Virtual Machine that will host our SQL Server. We can either create a clean VM with an OS image and install SQL Server ourselves, or we can create a <span>VM</span> with SQL Server already included. Managing databases in both cases is not much different from managing databases in an on-premises environment. You have the full version of SQL with all options you would have in the on-premises version.</p>
<p>Let's begin with creating a <span>VM</span> for our SQL Server and explain everything.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating an Azure Virtual Machine with a SQL image</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>As mentioned, you can either create a <span>VM</span> and install SQL Server later, or you can choose an image that already has SQL Server included. In this case, I'm going to choose an image named SQL Server 2016 <span>SP1 </span>Enterprise Edition which already has SQL Server included. This <span>VM</span> is based on Windows Server 2016, and this is going to be our OS.</p>
<p>Most options are very similar to options that we had when SQL Server wasn't included in the image used to create a virtual machine. We start with basic information, where we have to provide a <span class="packt_screen">Name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">VM disk type</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Username</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Password</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Subscription</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Resource group</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Location</span>. I strongly recommend you use <span class="packt_screen">SSD</span> as the VM disk type when creating a <span>VM</span> that will run SQL Server.</p>
<p>Disk speed has big impact on SQL Server performance, and selecting a faster disk type will help you get the best performance. A list of all basic settings and an example is shown in the screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-443 image-border" src="Images/14947137-e3ce-4f27-811f-e880cb01ba95.png" style="width:23.08em;height:46.08em;" width="331" height="660"/></p>
<p>Our next step is to select the size of the <span>VM</span>. Based on <span>the </span>disk type,<span> </span><span>the </span>list will be limited to sizes that support only<span> </span><span>the </span>disk type selected. When selecting<span> </span><span>the </span>size for<span> </span><span>the </span>VM that will run SQL Server, I recommend selecting more CPU and memory. SQL Server requires resources, and selecting<span> </span><span>the</span> right size is beneficial for performance. Luckily, if you select a size that is too big or too small, you can change it later. This is one of<span> </span><span>the </span>cloud computing perks, and you are not stuck with<span> </span><span>the</span> initial size. A list of VM sizes based on SSD are shown in<span> </span><span>the </span>following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-444 image-border" src="Images/502e69e6-ad12-4415-8df9-2d94bfb4ca89.png" style="width:109.58em;height:62.67em;" width="1315" height="752"/></p>
<p><span>The</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span>S</span>ettings</span> blade has all the options we have used before and we can <span>set a default for everything</span>. If you intend to set up high availability for your SQL Server, make sure you select <span class="packt_screen">Availability zone</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Availability set</span> now, as this cannot be done later. Also, take note of<span> </span><span>the</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span>N</span>etwork</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Subnet</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Network Security Group</span> that<span> </span><span>the V</span>M is going to be connected to. If multiple subnets are in use, you probably don't want SQL Server to end up in DMZ. The same goes with NSG—you probably want different security settings for SQL Server than Web Server. Luckily, these settings can be changed later. An example of the <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> is shown in the screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-445 image-border" src="Images/dbc5af29-92dd-4fbd-a850-4dd097fea0cf.png" style="width:20.83em;height:49.17em;" width="325" height="766"/></p>
<p>Finally, we have a set of settings which are specific to images with SQL Server and can't be found when creating <span>VM</span>s that don't have SQL Server included. In <span class="packt_screen">SQL Server settings</span> we can configure <span class="packt_screen">SQL connectivity</span>, <span class="packt_screen">SQL Authentication</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Storage configuration</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Automated patching</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Automated backup</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Azure Key Vault integration</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">R Services (Advanced analytics)</span>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p><span class="packt_screen">SQL connectivity</span> allows us to set up<span> </span><span>the</span> connectivity level and port. For<span> </span><span>the </span>connectivity level, we can allow connection to<span> </span><span>the </span>SQL Server only from within<span> </span><span>the VM:</span> <span class="packt_screen">Private (from Virtual Network)</span> and <span class="packt_screen">Public (over internet)</span>. I strongly recommend not using public access to SQL Server. This will expose your databases to access over<span> </span><span>the</span> internet; anyone can try to gain access and you're exposing<span> </span><span>the </span>database to brute force attacks. Access to SQL Server only from within<span> </span><span>the VM</span> may not be an option either, unless you run everything on a single VM and intend to run<span> </span><span>the </span>application on<span> </span><span>the </span>same server. Most often<span> </span><span>the</span> scenario will be private access from within <span>the</span> virtual network, allowing other <span>VM</span>s on<span> </span><span>the</span> same network to access<span> </span><span>the</span> database. The default <span class="packt_screen">Port</span> for SQL Server will be <kbd>1433</kbd> but can be changed if needed.</p>
<p>Default authentication for SQL Server will be Windows authentication, but you can <span class="packt_screen">Enable</span> <span class="packt_screen">SQL Authentication</span> if needed. If <span class="packt_screen">SQL Authentication</span> is enabled,<span> </span><span>the</span> username and password used for<span> </span><span>the </span>VM will be added as<span> </span><span>the</span> SQL login as well.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Storage configuration</span> is <span class="packt_screen">Not available</span> at this time and this setting will be used after<span> </span><span>the </span>VM is created.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Automated patching</span> is set to <span class="packt_screen">Sunday at 2:00</span> by default. This setting can be changed to another time, or it can be <span class="packt_screen">Disabled</span>. I recommend not disabling it, as this will ensure your SQL Server is up to date and patched with<span> </span><span>the </span>latest updates, including security updates. However, in some cases, you need to test updates before installing them, so in this case you want to disable them. Note that, in this case, you are responsible for keeping the server up to date.</p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">Automated backup</span> is <span class="packt_screen">Disabled</span> by default. If <span class="packt_screen">Enabled</span>, you have multiple options available. You can select<span> </span><span>the</span> storage account in which backups will be placed;<span> </span><span>the</span> retention period is 30 days by default, and it can be set to a lower value (minimum 1 and maximum 30 days). Backup encryption can be set to on or off; system database backup can be included if needed. The last option is to configure<span> </span><span>the</span> backup schedule. Automatic backup, set by default, will perform backup operations weekly. You can change this setting to daily. You can set up a time for backup, as well as the frequency. (This can be configured to back up<span> </span><span>the</span> database from every 5 minutes to once a day.)</p>
<p>The last two options are <span class="packt_screen">Azure Key Vault integration</span> and <span class="packt_screen">R Services <span>(Advanced analytics)</span></span>, and these allow you to <span class="packt_screen">Enable</span> these features if needed. Azure Key Vault will require Key Vault information that will be used, and R service will simply install additional analytics features.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>An example of <span class="packt_screen">SQL Server settings</span> is shown in<span> </span><span>the</span> following image:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-446 image-border" src="Images/0fed0fb4-8cd8-49c8-8447-4a8ff4ff9d1d.png" style="width:19.50em;height:44.75em;" width="332" height="762"/></p>
<p>Deploying Azure Virtual Machine with SQL Server takes a little longer than deploying a similar <span>VM</span> without SQL Server. This is due to passing additional information and configuring<span> </span><span>the</span> SQL Server instance inside<span> </span><span>the</span> VM.</p>

<p>Once<span> </span><span>the </span><span>VM</span> with SQL Server is deployed, you can find settings very similar to settings of other Azure Virtual Machines. The only difference is in the SQL Server configuration that can be found here.</p>
<p>Under <span class="packt_screen">SQL Server configuration</span> is a new blade which has<span> </span><span>the</span> same options as<span> </span><span>the</span> <span class="packt_screen">SQL Server settings</span> in<span> </span><span>the</span> last step of creating a new <span>VM</span> with SQL Server.</p>
<p>The first option in this blade is <span class="packt_screen">Storage</span>; the option that was <span class="packt_screen">Disabled</span> previously. Here we can find storage usage and performance. </p>
<p>Next are <span class="packt_screen">SQL connectivity</span> settings, in which we can change<span> </span><span>the</span> access level and SQL Server <span class="packt_screen">Port</span> and turn on <span class="packt_screen">SQL Authentication</span> (or turn it off if previously enabled).</p>
<p>A screenshot showing<span> </span><span>the</span> storage and connectivity part of the blade is shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-448 image-border" src="Images/8373edb9-e2a7-4e0e-81e5-2245fd5cf9c6.png" style="width:37.83em;height:33.42em;" width="652" height="576"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Other settings available under SQL Server configuration are <span class="packt_screen">Automated patching</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Automated backup</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Azure Key Vault integration</span> and <span class="packt_screen">R Services (Advanced analytics)</span>. All settings for these features are<span> </span><span>the</span> same as those available while creating<span> </span><span>the</span> <span>VM</span>. A screenshot with other settings follows:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-449 image-border" src="Images/50c2b9d4-51f5-4def-8d6b-6cc8b76671b5.png" style="width:34.00em;height:33.83em;" width="627" height="624"/></p>
<p>We can connect to<span> </span><span>the </span><span>VM</span> and use SQL Server Management Studio to connect to SQL Server. Alternatively, you can do<span> </span><span>the</span> same from your computer if SQL Server access is set to public. As you can see, when connected to SQL Server, you have all the options and features that are available when accessing SQL Server in a local on-premises environment. From this point, managing and administrating your databases in<span> </span><span>the</span> cloud is no different than doing<span> </span><span>the</span> same on<span> </span><span>the</span> local server or <span>VM</span>.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>We can perform any operation and make any change that we could do in<span> </span><span>the</span> local environment. The following screenshot shows us that all options available for<span> </span><span>the</span> local SQL Server are available for SQL Server in<span> </span><span>the</span> Azure Virtual Machine:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-450 image-border" src="Images/a1b8d97c-4ced-4e79-97f9-80e2a0ff7129.png" style="width:25.00em;height:18.67em;" width="512" height="382"/></p>
<p>Administering and maintaining<span> </span><span>the VM</span> itself is no different than managing any other Azure Virtual Machine. All settings are identical;<span> </span><span>the</span> only difference is that<span> </span><span>the</span> VM with SQL has <span>additional features such as SQL Server configuration</span>.</p>
<p>Now we'll move to SQL Server as <span>PaaS</span> and try to compare what each option is offering us and which choices are available. </p>

<p>The administration and management of SQL Server in Azure Virtual Machine is not much different from SQL Server on-premises. A similar thing can be said about creating a high-availability solution.</p>
<p>There are several options available to create high availability for SQL Server in Azure VM:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Always on failover cluster instances</span></li>
<li><span>Always on availability groups</span></li>
<li><span>Database mirroring</span></li>
<li><span>Log shipping</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">Note that in order to create such a solution,<span> </span><span>the </span><span>VM</span> must be placed in<span> </span><span>the</span> availability zone and/or availability set. </div>

<p>Running databases as <span>PaaS</span> (or DaaS) allows us to leverage PaaS advantages. This means that we have fewer settings available, but there is less maintenance as well. We don't have direct access to SQL Server and can't perform many operations, but we can still manage with preconfigured options that are available.</p>
<p>Let's begin creating Azure SQL Database and explain all the options.</p>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>To create a new Azure SQL Database, we need to provide a standard set of information such as <span class="packt_screen">Database name</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Subscription</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Resource group</span>. Additional information is specific to Azure SQL Database; we need to <span class="packt_screen">Select source</span>, provide <span class="packt_screen">Server</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Pricing tier</span>. There is<span> </span><span>the</span> option to select whether we <span class="packt_screen">want to use SQL elastic pool?</span> which is directly connected to<span> </span><span>the</span> <span class="packt_screen">Pricing tier</span>, and we'll get to that in a moment. For<span> </span><span>the</span> database source, we can select blank (empty database), sample (<kbd>AdventureWorkLT</kbd>, standard Microsoft sample database), and from backup (if this option is selected, we need to provide the storage information of where<span> </span><span>the</span> backup is located).</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Collation</span> of the database is always <kbd>SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS</kbd> and cannot be changed. A list of settings is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-451 image-border" src="Images/0b6d339d-98e9-474a-a2dc-d02ea0a6d372.png" style="width:19.92em;height:42.83em;" width="352" height="757"/></p>
<p>A database can not exist without a server, so during Azure SQL Database creation, we need to provide<span> </span><span>the</span> server. If there isn't an existing server, we need to create a new one. We need to provide a name (a unique name that will be used as a public endpoint), username, password, and location.</p>
<p>Pricing for Azure SQL Database can be confusing as there are multiple approaches. The first approach is single database pricing. In this pricing model, you are charged per database and<span> </span><span>the</span> server is free. You can have multiple databases on single or multiple servers;<span> </span><span>the</span> price is based on database count, and server count doesn't impact pricing. For example, we can have 10 Azure SQL Databases. The price will be same for these if<span> </span><span>the </span>databases are located on one server or on 10 different servers. Where it really gets complicated is<span> </span><span>the</span> pricing unit, <strong>database transaction unit</strong> (<strong>DTU</strong>). This is a blend measure of a CPU, memory, <span>data I/O, and transaction log I/O. Traditionally, in an on-premises environment, we would monitor the CPU, memory, and disk IOPS and translate this to DTU, but it is not that simple. Luckily, we have the ability to change this over time so that any size selected can be changed if we determine that the database performance is impacted or not utilizing current resources. Tiers available in the DTU model are <span class="packt_screen">Basic</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Standard</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Premium</span>, each coming with a different DTU value. <span class="packt_screen">Basic</span> comes with five DTUs and it goes up to 4,000 for Premium P15. Available space is also influenced by tier and can go from 2 GB for basic and up to 4 TB for P15. A screenshot of the DTU tier selection is shown here:</span></p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-453 image-border" src="Images/472ae901-c951-4404-a8d1-a2739c0ce03c.png" style="width:49.67em;height:23.50em;" width="1327" height="627"/></p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>As<span> </span><span>the</span> DTU model turned out to be complicated, Microsoft recently decided to introduce a new Azure SQL Database pricing model based on vCores. This model allows you to select how many vCores will be assigned to your database and how much memory will be available. The number of vCores can go from <span class="packt_screen">2</span> to <span class="packt_screen">80</span>. Memory depends on<span> </span><span>the </span>number of vCores, and can go from <span class="packt_screen">5.5</span> to <span class="packt_screen">408</span> GB. A screenshot of vCore tier selection is shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-454 image-border" src="Images/2b623c0b-0647-4264-9859-d230081b6cef.png" style="width:51.08em;height:23.58em;" width="1295" height="598"/></p>
<p>We mentioned that an elastic pool is also an option connected to pricing. This is a completely different model based on resource pooling. If elastic pool is selected as<span> </span><span>the </span>pricing model for Azure SQL Database,<span> </span><span>the</span> price isn't determined by<span> </span><span>the</span> number of databases but by<span> </span><span>the</span> size of<span> </span><span>the</span> pool. Both pricing models available for a single database are available for elastic pool, and we can select whether elastic pool resources will be based on DTUs or vCores. The difference between an elastic pool and a single database pricing model is that selected amount of resources are available to<span> </span><span>the </span>pool and resources are shared between databases located in<span> </span><span>the</span> elastic pool. So, if we select 4,000 DTUs for<span> </span><span>the</span> elastic pool, these will be shared between all databases located in the pool. In<span> a </span>scenario in which all your databases are highly utilized at the same time, this is not ideal and single database pricing should be selected. But if you have databases that have a high workload during different times of<span> </span><span>the</span> day, this is<span> </span><span>the</span> ideal scenario.</p>
<p>Let's say that you are hosting applications for clients located all over the world. This will peak database workload differently for each client and at different times based on their time zones. One database will have a high workload during work hours in Europe and have a low workload during work hours in<span> </span><span>the</span> USA. The database for a client in<span> </span><span>the</span> USA will have a low workload during work hours in Europe but a high workload during work hours in the USA. Placing these databases in<span> </span><span>the</span> elastic pool allows you to share resources, and databases can use more of the resources available in different <span>time periods</span>.</p>
<p>Deployment time of Azure SQL Database can depend on tier and source. The source determines<span> </span><span>the </span>size of<span> </span><span>the</span> database and what kind of operations need to be performed. It's logical that it takes less time to create a blank database than restoring a backup that has a couple of GBs or TBs of data. </p>
<p>Once deployment is finished, we can see two resources: <span class="packt_screen">SQL server</span> and <span class="packt_screen">SQL database</span>:</p>

<p>Managing an Azure SQL Database starts with <span class="packt_screen">Firewall settings</span>. By default, only Azure services are allowed to connect to your database. To allow any other connection, you need to set up a firewall rule that will accept a connection from an allowed IP addresses. To add your IP address, select <span class="packt_screen">Add client IP</span>. Azure portal will automatically detect your current IP address and add firewall rules. Note that you always need to select<span> </span><span>the</span> <span class="packt_screen"><span>S</span>ave</span> option when performing changes. Adding<span> </span><span>the</span> new IP address in firewall rules means nothing if you don't save<span> </span><span>the</span> new settings.</p>
<p>This has happened to me on more than one occasion—I added a new IP address and spent some time trying to figure out why I couldn't connect, only to realize I forgot to click on <span class="packt_screen">Save</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Firewall settings</span> are shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-456 image-border" src="Images/9161d420-9622-4e62-a007-29e39f98f44d.png" style="width:29.33em;height:29.50em;" width="642" height="645"/></p>
<p>Once we add our IP address, we can connect to Azure SQL Server with <strong>SQL Server Management Studio</strong> (<strong>SSMS</strong>). Note that we have a limited set of options compared to<span> </span><span>the </span>local instance of SQL Server. Beside databases and security, all other options are gone and we cannot manage databases as we did on-premises. A comparison between SQL Server and Azure SQL is shown in<span> </span><span>the</span> following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-457 image-border" src="Images/ed07ac3d-386a-4226-bc88-22cf493277c3.png" style="width:21.67em;height:17.75em;" width="482" height="396"/></p>
<p>Luckily, there are plenty of options available to us in Azure to manage databases, and most features won't be missed. Database administration and maintenance has never been so easy as with Azure SQL.</p>
<p>The first option unique to Azure SQL is the <span class="packt_screen">Query Editor</span>. This means that we no longer need SSMS; we can run any query from a browser. Some other task, performed in SSMS can be done in the Azure portal as well. A screenshot of a web query editor is shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-458 image-border" src="Images/a29eca71-ba8c-421d-b682-9dbf9923f43a.png" style="width:44.75em;height:26.83em;" width="1105" height="663"/></p>
<p><span class="packt_screen">SETTINGS</span> for Azure SQL Database have<span> </span><span>the</span> usual options such as <span class="packt_screen">Properties</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Locks</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Automation script</span>. <span class="packt_screen">Configure</span> is also an option often found in Azure resources settings, but unique options are <span class="packt_screen">Geo-Replication</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Connection strings</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Sync to other databases</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Add Azure Search</span>. Syncing to other databases allows you to create a sync group and set up group of databases that will automatically be synchronized. Adding an Azure search option allows you to connect<span> </span><span>the </span>database to a search service which allows you to perform full-text search without any additional coding or configuration.</p>
<p>The <span class="packt_screen">Configure</span> option under <span class="packt_screen">SETTINGS</span> allows you to change database tier. This will open a new blade that is identical to selecting<span> </span><span>the</span> database tier while creating a database. A screenshot of the database tier change is shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-460 image-border" src="Images/25235b8e-f858-4f65-9060-e3304a6b4a63.png" style="width:43.00em;height:18.25em;" width="1307" height="555"/></p>
<p>Connection strings allow you to find connection strings for your database for various programming languages. </p>
<p>Here is an example of a connection string for <kbd>ADO.NET</kbd>:</p>
<pre>Server=tcp:packt.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=Demo;Persist Security Info=False;User ID={your_username};Password={your_password};MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;</pre>
