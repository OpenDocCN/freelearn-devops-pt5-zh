		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-106"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Chapter 6</em>: Forms, Issues, Dashboards, and Reports</h1>
			<p>Our previous chapters have explored how to create <strong class="bold">Jira Work Management</strong> (<strong class="bold">JWM</strong>) projects and issues, which represent the work we do. We then looked at the new tools from JWM, how issues appear in each one, and the functionality they provide.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will guide you through the creation of a simple JWM form, along with other reporting functions such as viewing issues, and working with dashboards, filters, and built-in system reports.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we are going to cover the following main topics:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Creating forms</li>
				<li>Viewing issues</li>
				<li>Accessing and using reports</li>
				<li>Creating simple filters</li>
				<li>Implementing dashboards and incorporating gadgets</li>
				<li>New terms learned in this chapter</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to create a simple form that allows users inside or external to your team to be able to submit requests for work to be done. While the out-of-the-box reports provided with Jira offer little real insight, you will learn how to access and run the reports that are available.</p>
			<p>Finally, you will be able to create ad hoc reports in the form of Jira filters and utilize filters to build informative dashboards. Then, you can view your issues in a variety of displays using the knowledge you have about filters.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As JWM is only available in the Jira Cloud environment, the requirement for this chapter is simple: <em class="italic">access to a Jira Cloud environment</em>.</p>
			<p>If you already have access to Jira Cloud, that's great—you are ready to go! If not, Atlassian provides a free JWM account for up to 10 users. You can create an account by going to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free">https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free</a> and following the instructions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Creating forms</h1>
			<p>Until the rollout <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>of JWM projects, there was no way to have organization-wide Jira project forms available without using a third-party vendor, which usually meant additional cost. There have been Atlassian Marketplace apps available for years, as well as portal forms for JSM, but this meant either additional license fees for JSM agents or purchasing an app from the vendor.</p>
			<p>This will, of course, change as Atlassian begins to<a id="_idIndexMarker322"/> incorporate the <strong class="bold">ProForma forms</strong> functionality near the end of 2021 from the acquisition of ThinkTilt. It is unknown at the time of writing this book as to the effect of the ProForma tool across the Jira family, but it is thought that the built-in forms for JWM projects will continue alongside ProForma.</p>
			<p>So, what's the big deal about using forms anyway? What advantages does a form provide that the normal <strong class="bold">Create</strong> button and its associated screen do not? The fast answer is that it can remove many pain points we experience with the typical request process on both the receiving and submitting ends of a request. Here is a quick list, with more details to follow in the subsequent highlighted section:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Only ask for the initial information you need in an easy-to-fill format. (<em class="italic">Adding fields to a form</em>)</li>
				<li>Capture the information you want and eliminate back-and-forth emails. (<em class="italic">Adding fields to a form</em>)</li>
				<li>Change field labels to provide better context. (<em class="italic">Required fields and changing field labels</em>)</li>
				<li>An easy-to-share <strong class="bold">Uniform Resource Locator</strong> (<strong class="bold">URL</strong>) address <a id="_idIndexMarker323"/>for fast entry. (<em class="italic">Sharing a form</em>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Now, let's look<a id="_idIndexMarker324"/> at how we get to the <strong class="bold">Forms</strong> feature and create a new form.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Creating a form</h2>
			<p>You can get to<a id="_idIndexMarker325"/> your form by clicking the <strong class="bold">Forms</strong> link on the left-hand menu, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.1_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Creating a form&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Creating a form</p>
			<p>You can then click on the <strong class="bold">Create a new form</strong> button to begin the process. Let's take a glance at the features of the form in the following screenshot, and then delve into the details in the subsequent paragraphs:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.2_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – New form&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – New form</p>
			<p>The large middle section is your actual form. It will contain a few default fields to get you started. Additional<a id="_idIndexMarker326"/> fields (including any custom fields you have created) are located on the right-hand side. The top-middle section contains the form name, description, and the ability to share the form.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Adding fields to a form</h2>
			<p>Nothing is more <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>frustrating to a user than trying to figure out which fields really need to be populated when creating an issue. Screens are often awash with a sea of fields, most of which have nothing to do with the form creation process. Yes—you can provide the user with a separate <strong class="bold">Create</strong> screen with limited fields, but the layout can often be confusing.</p>
			<p>Many helpdesks and request processes allow users to simply submit an email to an address. Subsequently, that results in an issue automatically being created on the appropriate project. However, the information submitted is usually lacking the depth and details needed for the receiver of the request to actually work on a solution.</p>
			<p>The result is several emails back and forth to try to bring clarity by getting to the root of the problem. Not only is this impractical for the sheer number of emails that might happen, but the conversation becomes disjointed, and much time is wasted in the lag between sending and receiving the emails.</p>
			<p>But with forms, you can identify the exact information you need captured upfront when a request is submitted. Simply add any custom fields you need for new information and drag the field to the left to build the form. Add your custom fields to the project, and they will show up on the right-hand side ready to be used. Then, it's a simple drag and drop, as seen in<a id="_idIndexMarker328"/> the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.3_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – Adding fields to a form&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – Adding fields to a form</p>
			<p>Once a field has been added to the form, you can drag the fields up and down to re-order the sequence in which they appear to the user. Of course, if you no longer want the field to appear on your form, simply drag the field back to the right-hand side under the <strong class="bold">Drag fields to build the form</strong> section.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Adding a description for a form</h2>
			<p>For clarity when<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> sharing the form, it is a good idea to add a description to the form so that users can determine if this is the project and form desired. The description has wiki-style rendering available if  you would like to make it look a little nicer. The following screenshot shows where you can enter a description:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.4_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4 – Adding a form description&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – Adding a form description</p>
			<p>Next, we will see how required fields are identified and how to change labels for the fields.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>Required fields and changing field labels</h2>
			<p>Having the <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>ability <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>to change the label of a field that users see makes the form clearer as to the intent of the desired value for the field. On normal <strong class="bold">Create</strong> screens, we are stuck with the label of the field being the actual field name. You cannot change that label without changing the actual field name in those cases. But with JWM forms, you simply click the pencil icon, which gives you access to edit the field, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.5_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5 – Changing the field label&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – Changing the field label</p>
			<p>After making your label change, the field name will show your new name followed by the actual <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>field <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>name stored in the database. The field name will retain its original value; however, the requester will only see the new label. The label will be displayed above the entry box for the field, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.6_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6 – Changed label name&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – Changed label name</p>
			<p>Notice also that there is an asterisk next to the field label. The asterisk represents that the field is required to have a value in order to save and submit the request. You cannot make fields required directly in the JWM form—that must be done in the <strong class="bold">Field Configuration</strong> file associated with the project and issue type. You can find more details on <a id="_idIndexMarker334"/>field <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>configurations in <a href="B17952_07_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor121"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Fields, Screens, and Issue Layouts</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Previewing a form</h2>
			<p>After you have <a id="_idIndexMarker336"/>completed adding fields to your form and making any cosmetic changes such as changing label names or adding a description, it's time to preview your form. Of course, it is always a good idea to take a look at your form before sharing it with others. To see the form, click on the <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> button, as seen previously in <em class="italic">Figure 6.6</em>. Next, we see a preview of the created form, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.7_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7 – Previewing a finished form&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – Previewing a finished form</p>
			<p>Clicking on the <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> button will cause the form to show up in a new tab in your browser while your form layout remains open in the original tab. You can continue to make changes to<a id="_idIndexMarker337"/> the form and then click the <strong class="bold">Preview</strong> button each time to see how it looks.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-114"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>Sharing a form</h2>
			<p>Now that you<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/>r form looks how it should, let's share it with others so that they can begin to use it. To do that, simply click on the <strong class="bold">Share</strong> button, which will open the dialog box shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.8</em>. You can share a link to the form both with users in your Jira instance and external users to your system.</p>
			<p>As you begin typing a name or email address, the names of users in your instance that match the characters you are typing will begin to show. You can select the names as they become visible. For an email address, continue to type the full address and then click on the result to be sure it is placed in the edit box, as illustrated here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.8_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.8 – Sharing a form&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8 – Sharing a form</p>
			<p>Your form is now ready to be used. Submissions will be added as issues on your project and will use the default issue type for the project if you have more than one standard issue type.</p>
			<p>After the form is submitted, the user will receive an immediate notification on their screen that the<a id="_idIndexMarker339"/> issue has been received, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.9_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.9 – Form submission&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.9 – Form submission</p>
			<p>Now that users have an easy way to send you requests, let's look at some ways to interact with<a id="_idIndexMarker340"/> the issues.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-115"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Viewing issues</h1>
			<p>No matter how<a id="_idIndexMarker341"/> you receive issues—whether you create them directly yourself, or if they come via email or form submission—you will want to be able to view them and update them. If you receive an email notifying you that an issue has been created, clicking on the link in the email will take you directly to the issue.</p>
			<p>However, you sometimes just need to take a look at a list of your current issues, or maybe even ones that have been completed in the past. While in your project, you are just a click away from this.</p>
			<p>Regardless of which feature you might currently be viewing, you can click on the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> menu option on the left to see your issues, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.10_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.10 – Issues menu option&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.10 – Issues menu option</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> feature<a id="_idIndexMarker342"/> is a carryover tool from the previous Jira Core product. There's not been much of a change to it for those who have used it in the past, but for those of you who are new to the product now known as JWM, there are two standard views for issues—<strong class="bold">List View</strong> and <strong class="bold">Detail View</strong>.</p>
			<p><code> through a <strong class="bold">Basic</code> filter interface or you can switch to <strong class="bold">Jira Query Language</strong> (<strong class="bold">JQL</strong>), Jira's built-in querying language.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">List View</strong> was previously displayed in <em class="italic">Figure 6.10</em>, while <strong class="bold">Detail View</strong> can be seen in the following screenshot, which also shows where to click to switch between the two views:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.11_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11 – Detail View with buttons to switch&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11 – Detail View with buttons to switch</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Detail View</strong> allows you to edit a single issue using the project's <strong class="bold">Edit</strong> screen while also displaying the list of issues <a id="_idIndexMarker344"/>on the left-hand side. You can run a basic or advanced search on both <strong class="bold">List View</strong> and <strong class="bold">Detail View</strong>. Next, we will see how to access and run reports.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-116"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Accessing and using reports</h1>
			<p>Another<a id="_idIndexMarker345"/> holdover<a id="_idIndexMarker346"/> from the Jira Core product is the built-in Jira reports. These reports are not unique to JWM/business-type projects but are widely available across the Jira product family. Nevertheless, they can provide some informative insights into your project.</p>
			<p>To access a list of reports, click on the <strong class="bold">Reports</strong> option on the left-hand side menu, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.12_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.12 – Accessing reports&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.12 – Accessing reports</p>
			<p>The result will <a id="_idIndexMarker347"/>be a <a id="_idIndexMarker348"/>display of all built-in reports available for JWM projects and is shown in the following screenshot. You are encouraged to explore each one individually:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.13_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13 – List of reports&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.13 – List of reports</p>
			<p>To run a report, just click on the link and follow the subsequent steps as directed. As you can imagine, there is not a lot of functionality for this basic reporting feature, and most users will end up creating ad hoc reports in the form of filters. Those filters can then be used in a variety of <a id="_idIndexMarker349"/>gadgets <a id="_idIndexMarker350"/>within dashboards or as filters themselves. We will explore all of those next.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-117"><a id="_idTextAnchor116"/>Creating simple filters</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Filters</strong> are Jira's way<a id="_idIndexMarker351"/> of searching for issues that exist in your instance that can be used as a base for further insight and reporting/sharing or to find a single issue that you are looking for. Perhaps the easiest way is to access these through <strong class="bold">Issues View</strong>, as discussed in the <em class="italic">Viewing issues</em> section earlier in this chapter. That will allow you to create a simple filter, which can then be used to see a list of issues immediately, or it can be saved and used as a base for building a dashboard.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, you can click on the search box found in the top navigation menu. Once inside the search box, click on the <strong class="bold">Advanced issue search</strong> link, as illustrated in the following screenshot. Finally, you can also click on the <strong class="bold">Filters</strong> menu option at the bottom of the page:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.14_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.14 – Creating a filter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.14 – Creating a filter</p>
			<p>Even newcomers to Jira and JWM projects will be able to create simple filters to retrieve lists of issues that can be used for a variety of purposes, including gadgets in dashboards, for exporting to <strong class="bold">comma-separated values</strong> (<strong class="bold">CSV</strong>) files, or even just getting a count of how<a id="_idIndexMarker352"/> much work you are doing.</p>
			<p>Entering the filter creation function in Jira will bring the user to the tool in basic mode, as shown in <em class="italic">Figure 6.15</em>. Simply click on each heading and supply the values you would like to use for the resulting list of issues, and then click on <strong class="bold">Search</strong>. There are many built-in fields already available to you to speed up the creation of a filter.</p>
			<p>As you select each field, the filter builds upon itself, using an <code>AND</code> function between each field. This means that all of the values selected for every field will be used to return the results.</p>
			<p>An initial filter to try is to select just the project you are working on and click the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> button, as<a id="_idIndexMarker353"/> illustrated here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.15_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.15 – Basic filter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.15 – Basic filter</p>
			<p>You can also click on <strong class="bold">Detail View</strong> to see a single issue displayed, as we saw previously in <em class="italic">Figure 6.11</em>. In the following screenshot, we are filtering by <strong class="bold">List View</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.16_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.16 – Filtering by List View&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.16 – Filtering by List View</p>
			<p>For more experienced<a id="_idIndexMarker354"/> users, you can switch to the advanced search function directly using <strong class="bold">JQL</strong>. This allows you to enter code directly in the search box to see more granular results. If you are not familiar with JQL, you should take some training on how to use it before attempting to use it here. One such course is available through Atlassian University here: <a href="https://university.atlassian.com/student/path/849533-gain-project-insights-through-jql">https://university.atlassian.com/student/path/849533-gain-project-insights-through-jql</a>.</p>
			<p>You can change back to the basic search function by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Switch to basic</strong> link to the right of the <strong class="bold">Search</strong> button, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.17_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.17 – Advanced JQL filter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.17 – Advanced JQL filter</p>
			<p>More than likely, you are going to want to run these same filters repeatedly or use them in a dashboard gadget. Therefore, you will need to save the filter first. To start that process, click the <strong class="bold">Save as</strong> link <a id="_idIndexMarker355"/>at the top of the search display.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-118"><a id="_idTextAnchor117"/>Saving a filter</h2>
			<p>Saving a filter is <a id="_idIndexMarker356"/>very simple. Just provide a unique name in the <code>STAFF – All Issues</code>, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.18_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.18 – Saving a filter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.18 – Saving a filter</p>
			<p>When you initially save<a id="_idIndexMarker357"/> a filter, you will be the only person able to see the results. You can leave it that way if you intend to keep the filter private, but if you want to share the filter and its results, you will need to modify the permissions. The place to do that is a little hidden. You will need to click on the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> link at the top of the filter screen, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.19_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.19 – Filter permissions and sharing a filter&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.19 – Filter permissions and sharing a filter</p>
			<p>After clicking on the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> link, you will navigate to the <strong class="bold">Edit filter</strong> screen. Incidentally, this is also where you will change the name of the filter if you wish to do that at some point. You can also add a description for the filter on this screen.</p>
			<p>To share the filter, click on the drop-down box under the <strong class="bold">Viewers</strong> label. As you see in <em class="italic">Figure 6.19</em>, you can share the filter with persons linked to the <strong class="bold">Project</strong> through project roles, or to a <strong class="bold">Group</strong> of users already created in your Jira instance, or to your organization as a whole—meaning any logged-in user. If you wish to keep the filter to yourself, select the <strong class="bold">Private</strong> option.</p>
			<p>Finally, you can create a <strong class="bold">subscription</strong> for the filter, which will email the filter and its results on a <a id="_idIndexMarker358"/>scheduled basis, as identified when creating it. To produce a subscription, click on the <strong class="bold">New subscription</strong> link on the <strong class="bold">Details</strong> page, as previously seen in <em class="italic">Figure 6.19</em>. Enter the details of the subscription and click the <strong class="bold">Subscribe</strong> button to save it, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.20_B17952.jpg" alt="Filter 6.20 – Creating a filter subscription&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Filter 6.20 – Creating a filter subscription</p>
			<p>After you have created some filters, you can begin to use those filters in a variety of gadgets on a dashboard. Next, we will walk through the process of creating a dashboard and adding<a id="_idIndexMarker359"/> different types of gadgets.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-119"><a id="_idTextAnchor118"/>Implementing dashboards and incorporating gadgets</h1>
			<p><strong class="bold">Dashboards</strong> are <a id="_idIndexMarker360"/>a great <a id="_idIndexMarker361"/>way to see multiple reports on a single screen. Jira refers to these mini-reports as <strong class="bold">gadgets</strong>. Gadgets come in a <a id="_idIndexMarker362"/>variety of formats—bar graphs, pie charts, simple lists, and <strong class="bold">two-dimensional</strong> (<strong class="bold">2D</strong>) pivots. To create a new dashboard, click on the <strong class="bold">Dashboards</strong> option in the top navigation menu bar and select <strong class="bold">Create dashboard</strong>, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.21_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.21 – Dashboards&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.21 – Dashboards</p>
			<p>The ensuing dialog box allows you to name the dashboard, along with entering a description. On this screen, you can also share the dashboard using the same permissions functionality we discussed earlier for filters (see <em class="italic">Figure 6.19)</em>. I have named mine <code>Staff Meeting Dashboard</code>, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.22_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.22 – Naming and sharing a dashboard&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.22 – Naming and sharing a dashboard</p>
			<p>After<a id="_idIndexMarker363"/> clicking <a id="_idIndexMarker364"/>the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button, you will see the initially created dashboard. By default, the layout is a two-column dashboard. You can change the layout to a single column, triple columns, or dual columns, with either the right or left column being wider. Click the <strong class="bold">Change layout</strong> button to select your desired layout, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.23_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.23 – Changing the dashboard layout&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.23 – Changing the dashboard layout</p>
			<p>We will continue to use the two-column layout for our example here. Our next step will be to add some <a id="_idIndexMarker365"/>gadgets. So, click <a id="_idIndexMarker366"/>on the <strong class="bold">add a new gadget</strong> link on one of the sides of the screen. The initial list of gadgets will be very small. You will need to click the <strong class="bold">Load all gadgets</strong> option to see a more thorough list, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.24_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.24 – Load all gadgets&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.24 – Load all gadgets</p>
			<p>The resulting list will show more than 30 options. Each will have a thumbnail image to the left to give you an idea of what the end report will look like. The name of the gadget and a short description appear in the middle section. Be sure to scroll down the alphabetical list to see all the available gadgets. Click on the <strong class="bold">Add gadget</strong> button on the right for each desired gadget.</p>
			<p>The same list screen will continue to be displayed after you click on the <strong class="bold">Add gadget</strong> button. This enables you to select multiple gadgets without having to go back to the list for subsequent options. When you have finished selecting all your desired gadgets, click the <strong class="bold">Close</strong> button, as <a id="_idIndexMarker367"/>illustrated<a id="_idIndexMarker368"/> in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.25_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.25 – Adding a gadget&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.25 – Adding a gadget</p>
			<p>Each gadget will have different parameters within the configuration page to capture the details of the filter, column headings, and so on. These should be self-explanatory as you complete the configuration.</p>
			<p>Once the gadget has been added and the parameters have been entered, the results will be displayed (see the subsequently completed dashboard in <em class="italic">Figure 6.26</em>).</p>
			<p>However, there is a good chance that you will need to modify the gadget to note additional information, change the filter, add new columns, and so on. To do that, click on the three dots (ellipsis) menu in the upper-right corner of the gadget and select <strong class="bold">Configure</strong>. This will return you to the configuration page for the gadget, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.26_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.26 – Configuring a gadget&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.26 – Configuring a gadget</p>
			<p>Once you are on <a id="_idIndexMarker369"/>the<a id="_idIndexMarker370"/> configuration page, you can change out the filter, the fields being used, and so on. Again, as each gadget is different, the configuration page for each is different. The following screenshot shows an example of a completed dashboard using three separate gadgets, which display a good variety available:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.27_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 6.27 – Completed dashboard&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.27 – Completed dashboard</p>
			<p>I think you will find that a dashboard that is well laid out and has a good variety of gadget types that <a id="_idIndexMarker371"/>include a<a id="_idIndexMarker372"/> summary and detailed information will be a great way to share your project data with stakeholders and others.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-120"><a id="_idTextAnchor119"/>New terms learned in this chapter</h1>
			<p>Let's conclude the chapter by going through a list of new terms learned in it, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dashboard</strong>: A consolidated<a id="_idIndexMarker373"/> display of multiple reports (known as gadgets).</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Gadgets</strong>: Usually based <a id="_idIndexMarker374"/>on filters, these mini-reports can be displayed as lists, graphs, charts, pivot tables, and so on.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">ProForma forms</strong>: An app<a id="_idIndexMarker375"/> or add-on that provides the extensive customization of standard forms.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Subscription</strong>: Filter<a id="_idIndexMarker376"/> results that can be emailed to selected users on an ongoing basis.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-121"><a id="_idTextAnchor120"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>Basically, at this point, you have all the knowledge you need to create a project and some issues and interact with them in a variety of ways to help manage your work. In this chapter, we have learned how to build a form, which will provide an easy way for persons inside or exterior to your team to make a work request. We have also seen how to use the <strong class="bold">Issues</strong> feature, along with the reporting function. This allows you to view your issues in a way that gives you good data and allows you to search with more control.</p>
			<p>And finally, we learned how dashboards can provide you and stakeholders with easy-to-read gadgets that display your work in totals and groups or as easy-to-use graphics such as pie charts and bar graphs. These dashboards provide real-time views of your data, all in a single location. This is beneficial because you do not need additional presentation software or cut and paste efforts to transfer the Jira data to another format.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will learn how to create additional screens and custom fields for organization-wide use, and how to make modifications to those screens. This will be done in the context of understanding the associated screen scheme and issue-type screen scheme. And finally, we will see how we can change the layouts of the screens so that they can be unique to your project if so desired.</p>
