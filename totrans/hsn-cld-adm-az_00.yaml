- en: Welcome to *Hands-On Cloud Administration in Azure*. This book is designed to
    help you start with Azure and guide you on your cloud journey. We will start with
    cloud concepts that will help you to understand the difference between cloud and
    local infrastructure. Basic **Infrastructure as a Service** (**IaaS**) and **Platform
    as a Service** (**PaaS**) services will be explained, to help you understand how
    to leverage cloud to your advantage. Next, we'll move to migration and then hybrid
    cloud, and explain how to move your services to the cloud and how to combine them
    with on-premises resources. Identity and security will be covered in order to
    explain how to secure and protect your cloud resources. Finally, we'll go over
    some best practices and Infrastructure-as-Code to help you administer and monitor
    your resources.
