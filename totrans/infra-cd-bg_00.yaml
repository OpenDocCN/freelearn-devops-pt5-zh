  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In [*Chapter 1*](B19537_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023)*, Choosing the Right Approach
    – Declarative or Imperative*, we introduce fundamental Infrastructure-as-Code
    concepts, covering the challenges of manual infrastructure management, declarative
    versus imperative approaches, and the *pets versus cattle* analogy, setting the
    stage for understanding its importance in modern deployments.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In [*Chapter 2*](B19537_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085)*, Ansible and Terraform beyond
    the Documentation,* we delve into Terraform, an Infrastructure-as-Code tool by
    HashiCorp, and Ansible, a configuration management tool by Red Hat. We will explore
    tool selection criteria, be introduced to Terraform and Ansible, and review some
    guidance on using Visual Studio Code as an IDE for writing code, including some
    recommended extensions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In[*Chapter 3*](B19537_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130)*, Planning the Deployment,*
    we highlight the importance of planning in your Infrastructure-as-Code deployments.
    You will be introduced to the workload to be deployed, learn about deployment
    approaches, and explore a step-by-step guide for efficient and error-free execution.
    We will also examine the high-level infrastructure architecture, preparing us
    for our upcoming Azure and AWS deployment.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In [*Chapter 4*](B19537_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor151)*, Deploying to Microsoft
    Azure, we* explore deploying our project to Microsoft Azure, one of the two major
    public cloud providers covered in this book. Topics include introducing Azure,
    preparing the cloud environment, creating the low-level design, and using Terraform
    and Ansible for writing and deploying the infrastructure code.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In [*Chapter 5*](B19537_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor268)*, Deploying to Amazon Web
    Services, we* move onto deploying the project to **Amazon Web Services** (**AWS**)
    while highlighting the key differences between Azure and AWS. We will delve deeper
    into Ansible for deployment and gain insights into using both Ansible and Terraform
    for managing AWS resources. By the end of the chapter, you will understand how
    to adapt your deployment approach for different cloud providers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In [*Chapter 6*](B19537_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor350)*, Building upon the Foundations,
    we delve* into the nuances of deploying high-level designs across public cloud
    providers using cloud-agnostic tools such as Terraform and Ansible. We will learn
    from my experiences of addressing variations between providers, exploring practical
    approaches for creating repeatable deployment processes, and looking at the importance
    of modular code, allowing for streamlined deployment efforts and code reusability.

    the Cloud, w*e will now focus on using CI/CD to automate infrastructure deployment.
    We will explore GitHub Actions, a popular CI/CD tool, and learn how to use it
    to run Terraform and Ansible code for both Azure and AWS.'

- en: '*In* [*Chapter 8*](B19537_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor509)*, Common Troubleshooting
    Tips and Best Practices,* we will learn essential strategies for planning, writing,
    and troubleshooting Infrastructure-as-Code projects. The chapter covers best practices
    and troubleshooting tips for Infrastructure as Code in general and specific guidance
    for Terraform and Ansible. By understanding the unique challenges associated with
    each tool, you will be better prepared to handle obstacles that may arise during
    your Infrastructure-as-Code journey.'

    Infrastructure-as-Code Tools*, we will expand our Infrastructure-as-Code toolset
    by exploring three additional tools: Pulumi, Azure Bicep, and AWS CloudFormation.
    The chapter aims to provide hands-on understanding and knowledge of these tools,
    highlighting the differences between cloud-agnostic and provider-specific tools
    and showcasing Pulumi’s unique approach using familiar programming languages.'

- en: Before starting, you should understand how you would approach and deploy the
    infrastructure to support one or more of your existing applications. Ideally,
    this infrastructure would be hosted in either Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While this is optional, the book has been written with the assumption that you
    have a basic understanding of either Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services and
    some of the core services’ basic concepts, such as networking or virtual machines.
    While this is not essential, you may have to do some further reading about why
    we approached tasks in a certain way regarding some of the more hands-on chapters.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also assume that you would like to follow along with some of the more practical
    chapters; therefore, having credits or access to a Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web
    Services account that isn’t used to host production resources is a bonus.
