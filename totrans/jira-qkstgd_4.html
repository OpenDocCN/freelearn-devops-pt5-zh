<p>In this chapter, we'll discuss how to implement a help desk using Jira Service Desk to take care of IT help desk and support requests, which isn't just easy to use but also comes with pre-configured features of a ticketing system out of the box.</p>
<p>We'll first begin with various aspects of a typical help desk system, then we'll quickly create a Jira Service Desk project and go through its various features to understand how it can help us implement a great service desk.</p>
<p>Topics covered in this chapter include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using Jira Service Desk for help desks</li>
<li>Overview of help desks</li>
<li>Creating a Jira Service Desk project</li>

<p>Jira Service Desk is the fastest growing Atlassian product because it makes it so easy for a help desk team to manage its work. So far in this book, we've been discussing various aspects of Jira. We've already covered Jira Core and Jira Software features by creating projects to understand how you and your team can use this intuitive tool to manage tasks and development activities. Jira Service Desk was built while keeping in mind customer satisfaction first and foremost, and making it very simple for any customer to raise and track their tickets in Jira Service Desk using a friendly customer portal; at the same time, technicians (also known as agents) work on those tickets using a familiar Jira interface.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Enabling Jira Service Desk</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In <a href="a833f753-0310-4b30-8097-f5238af90724.xhtml">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Using Jira Software for Development Teams</em>, we learned how to enable new applications by going to the Manage Subscription section under Billing. Please do the same thing and enable Jira Service Desk on your cloud instance.</p>
<p>After enabling Jira Service Desk, you'll have 30 days to evaluate or learn it.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Overview of Helpdesk</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>So, now you're anxious to create a project in Jira Service Desk but it makes more sense to first go through the basics of a typical help desk system and understand its various aspects. These concepts will help you understand Jira Service Desk better.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Basic features of any help desk</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's do a quick walk-through of various aspects and features of a typical help desk:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Different user roles—customers and agents: </strong>In a help desk, there're primarily two types of users; one is your customer, who will raise a ticket on the system to get help from the service or support desk. The agent, on the other hand, will respond to the tickets and provide help to the customers.</li>
<li><strong>Service level agreement: </strong>Customers expect a quick resolution of their tickets. You can't expect them to wait indefinitely after raising a ticket. The service level agreement, also commonly known as SLA, defines how quickly agents will respond and resolve the ticket. Multiple SLAs can be defined and agreed with the customer or your client when providing services to them. SLAs are nothing but a time frame within which agents will do a certain action such as resolving tickets.</li>
<li><strong>Email notifications: </strong>Any help desk tool provides a platform for both customers and agents to interact with each other; however, sending email alerts to your customers will ensure that a ticket has been successfully raised and received by the support team. During the lifecycle of the ticket, on many occasions an email notification can be sent to involved parties; this is to ensure that the appropriate action is taken on time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ability to engage with customers: </strong>The ticket, when raised by the customer, can be resolved directly by an agent or further information is needed by an agent to take further action on the ticket. Agents can also interact with the customer by posting comments on the ticket for customers and they can also reply by typing comments. It's a great way to have interaction between them.</li>
<li><strong>Reports: </strong>The service desk team manager wants to take a look at various analytics to understand how well his or her team is performing. There're many questions that manager will ask, such as: How many ticket did we resolve last month? How many times was the SLA breached? Are we overbooked? How many tickets are currently open? Answers to these questions can be found by looking at reports in a service desk tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's now look at common help desk processes.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Help desk processes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Help desks can be used to provide support to customers by handling their tickets. The tickets can be of different types and the way agents work on the tickets can be different based on the nature of the request. The way a ticket is handled is defined by the process behind it.  Processes define how to handle different types of requests</p>
<p>The most common help desk processes are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Incident managemen</strong>t: <em>Website is down</em> is an incident</li>
<li><strong>Problem management</strong>: <em>Website is down almost every week</em> could be due to a problem</li>
<li><strong>Change management</strong>: <em>Update the database version</em> is a change</li>
<li><strong>Service request</strong>: <em>Please reset my password</em> is a service request</li>
</ul>
<p>There're many other processes, such as release management and knowledge management; if you want to know more about them, please read about ITIL (formerly an acronym for Information Technology Infrastructure Library), which is a set of detailed practices for <strong>IT Service Management</strong> (<strong>ITSM</strong>).</p>
<p>Now we have the necessary background to start working on Jira Service Desk.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Different ways to raise tickets</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Tickets are usually raised by customers and handled by agents; however, you must be wondering: How will a customer raise a ticket?</p>
<p>In Jira, there're four different ways to raise tickets in Jira Service Desk:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Customer portal</strong>: This is a web-based interface integrated with the knowledge base in Confluence</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Email</strong>: A customer can send an email to the help desk</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>Jira Service Desk</strong>: An agent can raise a ticket on behalf of a customer</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400"><strong>RESTful API</strong>: A ticket can be raised programmatically</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to know about them because, in Jira Service Desk, these different ways to raise tickets are known as channels. For the help desk or service desk manager, it's very important to know the number of tickets raised through a specific channel.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Creating a Jira Service Desk project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Let's create a Jira Service Desk project in our instance. We've already enabled a Jira Service Desk subscription in our instance.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps to create a Jira Service Desk project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to Jira settings | Projects  and then click on the Create project button in the top-right corner, as shown here:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/3839abd4-f86e-402f-94d2-3c4c8af0b943.png"/></p>

<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/29857953-cee1-4fe1-993e-40d58246afdd.png" style="width:57.00em;height:35.17em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 4</p>
<p>You can start using this project straightaway as the IT service desk template comes with out-of-the-box configurations; however, we'll go through various aspects of the project to understand how you can customize it to make it more aligned to your specific requirements.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using Jira Service Desk</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Congratulations on creating your first Jira Service Desk project! Although you can start using it out-of-the-box, we want to learn important aspects of it, starting with the customer portal, which is the web interface customers can use to raise tickets and reach out to you.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Customer portal</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The most important purpose of the Service Desk application is to focus on a support request and ticketing system to cater to the requests of end users and customers. Using Jira, a simple project can be created to track issues and access can be given to customers, provided there're enough licenses; however, but in general, end users may not find it intuitive to log in to an issue tracker to raise their requests. Atlassian understood this concern and created a Service Desk application with a dedicated customer portal, which is a quite neat and simple interface on which to raise support requests.</p>
<p>Every Service Desk project will have its own customer portal URL like the following:</p>
<p><kbd>https://JIRAURL/servicedesk/customer/portal/1</kbd></p>
<p>You'll find this URL when you click on the Raise a request tab in the project sidebar. You can share this URL with your customers or publish it on your website. The customer portal offers a simple and intuitive interface to raise the request. Let's go through this portal; please open this URL in your web browser. You'll see a screen similar to the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d92b294e-f2c9-46fb-9089-fa674317c655.png" style="width:44.75em;height:29.92em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>On the left side, various groups are listed and, under each of them, several requests types, such as Get IT help, Set up VPN to the office, and Request a new account, are listed. These request types are actually assigned to a specific issue type in Jira. We can create a new request type and map it to any existing issue type.</p>
<p>Click on Report a system problem to open a new page with a form to raise a request, as shown here:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/4116c7d0-5f45-4508-b0ce-a31105536b7d.png" style="width:24.33em;height:41.08em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<p>Customers can fill in this form and click on the Create button to raise the request.</p>
<p>Once the request is submitted, a Jira issue is created for the service desk agent in the project.</p>
<p>The customer portal can be further customized; please refer to the following links to find out more:</p>

</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Queues</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A queue is simply a filtered list of issues based on predefined conditions. For instance, there're several queues already defined in your project such as All open, Assigned to me, Unassigned issues, Incidents, Service requests, Change, and Problem. You can find them when you click on Queues in your project sidebar.</p>
<p>You can also create your own queues. Go to Queues and click on the New queue link, the result is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/3a0b671b-3635-4ff9-a5d5-2f5d990dc6e7.png" style="width:41.83em;height:27.00em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 7</p>
<p>In the Create queue screen, under Name enter <kbd>In Progress</kbd> and, under Issues to show, select Status as In Progress. If you're familiar with JQL, then click on the Advanced link right next to the Issues to show section. Press the Create button to save the queue.</p>
<p>The queue will now be saved and available in the existing list of queues in your project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Customer permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Your Service Desk project is by default open for everyone to raise tickets but we can limit which user or group is a customer and can raise requests in this project.</p>
<p>Go to Customer | Change permissions to manage who can raise tickets, as shown in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/19ca956d-ade7-4dbb-b630-bb48957dad8a.png" style="width:39.33em;height:30.42em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 8</p>
<p>Here you can also opt to let customers further share tickets from the customer portal with other customers.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Configuring Jira Service Desk </h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>There're various configurations available in Jira Service Desk. These options are available under the Project settings of your project. The majority of these configurations are specific to a Jira Service Desk project and define how your customers will interact with the Service Desk.</p>
<p>Let's look at the important configurations.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Request types</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Earlier, we discussed the customer portal, which is a simple interface for end users. They get to choose the different types of request, which are internally mapped to a specific Issue type. Under this section, you can create a new request type and modify existing ones, as shown in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d7d34ded-0f80-4e79-ab4d-751361140d70.png" style="width:46.92em;height:32.25em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 9</p>
<p>Enter the Request name, such as Hardware problem, select Issue type as Problem, enter Description, and press the Create request type button. Now, if you go back to your customer portal, there'll be a new request type added, but it'll only contain the Summary field. Let's now add a few more fields to this request type, as shown in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/b4136720-1922-4a28-a067-8044f2ca183c.png" style="width:44.17em;height:14.00em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 10</p>
<p>Click on the Edit fields link corresponding to the request type you want to modify, as shown:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ff71299a-968c-4646-965d-049094b6e51c.png" style="width:44.08em;height:26.58em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 11</p>
<p>Now click on the Add a field button on the top-right corner of the screen; the result is shown in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/7d72a64c-cad8-414e-8f78-0e73c0c3a6e6.png" style="width:38.17em;height:35.67em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 12</p>
<p>In the Add a field popup, select the fields that you want to add and press the Apply button.</p>
<p>The fields will now be added and will be visible to the end user on the customer portal. You can also make some fields as required under this section.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Portal settings</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this section, you can change the Name of your customer portal, which is by default the same as your project name, and you can upload a custom logo.</p>
<p>It's also possible to give an announcement to the users that will be displayed on top of your customer portal.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Email requests</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Apart from the customer portal, you can configure Jira Service Desk in such a way that your customers can raise tickets by simply sending an email to a specific email address. We need to configure our project first to enable this functionality.</p>
<p>Click on the Turn on email requests button as shown in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/5c40119c-65c8-4eb4-b951-b98ffc14eaff.png" style="width:34.75em;height:21.58em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 13</p>
<p>On the next screen, click on the Add a custom email address button; the result is shown in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/9c38d247-e7b3-460c-9880-cca18fdce7e5.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 14</p>
<p>In the Set up email channel popup, enter the details of your email account. If you're using a Google Apps account, then enter the Email address and Password, but you can also configure POP- and IMAP-based accounts from the Other tab. Press the Next button to continue. The following screen will be displayed:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d967e517-2ae9-4e99-a910-b6622c5b2de7.png" style="width:34.50em;height:29.58em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 15</p>
<p>Now you'll need to select which request type will be used to create issues from email and press the Done button at the bottom.</p>
<p>The email will now be configured with this project. Jira Service Desk will continuously read the specified inbox and, whenever there's a new mail, it'll copy the email subject in the Summary field and the email content in the Description field.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Satisfaction settings</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the Service Desk project, your customers can give feedback. This will help you understand how satisfied they are. Under this section, you can enable or disable this feature.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Knowledge base</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Service Desk projects can be integrated with a Confluence space. This is useful: when customers raise a request through the customer portal, they can be presented with the related pages on Confluence. Customers can then go through those related pages and can possibly solve their problems and may not need to raise a request. The integration with Confluence can be done under this section, where you can specify which space in your Confluence will be linked to your Jira Service Desk project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">SLAs</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Service Desk projects come with some pre-configured service level agreements, also known as SLAs. Some common SLAs are listed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time to resolution</strong>: Time taken from creation to resolution of the issue</li>
<li><strong>Time to first response</strong>: Time taken from creation to a comment being added for a customer</li>
</ul>
<p>We can also create our own SLA, such as Time to assign. Perform the following steps to create a new SLA in your project:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on the New Metric link on the left side</li>
<li>In the New Metric screen, enter the Name: of the metric as <kbd>Time to assign</kbd></li>
<li>Select the Start time when the count will begin</li>
<li>Select the Stop time when the count will finish</li>
<li>Under the Goals section, enter the Goal as 4h for All remaining issues and press the Update button</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>Press the Create button on top to save the new SLA, as shown in the following:</li>
</ol>

<p>Figure 16</p>
<p>The new SLA will be reflected in all existing and new issues in your project. In this section, you can also configure calendars with working days, working time, and holidays. The SLA clock will stop outside working hours and these calendars can be mapped to any SLAs. The SLA goal that we defined could be for all issues in the project or for a subset of issues based on the JQL in the SLA configurations.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Automation</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Service Desk projects come with a nifty utility you can use to add some automation tasks in the project. This utility assists the team with performing recurring tasks and enforcing some policies.</p>
<p>For instance, we just added a new SLA time to assign the issue to an agent within four hours of its creation. We could actually post a comment on the request when only 60 minutes are remaining in this SLA. This comment would be visible only to existing agents assigned to this project.</p>
<p>To add a new rule, click in the Add rule button on the top-right corner, as shown in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/427d7823-8539-4906-9c5a-5f6a67294b84.png" style="width:44.00em;height:25.25em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 17</p>
<p>In the New automation rule popup, select Create a custom rule and press the Continue button:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/66824c05-8c1f-4a3e-bdfa-569f67a3d6cb.png" style="width:44.00em;height:35.92em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 18</p>
<p>In the next screen, we now have to Add trigger under When this happens and we have to Add action under Then do this:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/8625ffc7-d2b3-4607-82e8-a961206b293d.png" style="width:39.33em;height:30.83em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 19</p>
<p>Click on the Add trigger, select SLA time remaining as Time to assign and press the Add button. Just make sure Event is set to Due soon (60 min remaining), as shown:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/4d39fdd7-d632-410d-bcc5-425c8432aa8c.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 20</p>
<p>Now click on Add action, select Add comment, select Comment type as Internal, and press the Add button as shown in the following:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/9b9c5bad-1938-4e08-a2b5-6521f34192c4.png" style="width:36.33em;height:27.75em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 21</p>
<p>We've now added a new rule that will post an internal comment on the issue when the SLA is due in the next 60 minutes; based on your notification schemes in the project, you might also receive an email notification from Jira Service Desk.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Jira Service Desk reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>The Service Desk project comes with some really good built-in reports that'll help you understand the current progress of your team working on the support project.</p>
<p>Let's understand the purpose of these reports. These reports are available under your project sidebar if you click on the Reports link.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Workload</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is a simple report that shows the number of requests your team is working on right now. It'll help you to evenly distribute the workload among your agents. The reports displays the number of issues in progress for each agent. This is an important report that helps the project lead evenly distribute the work among agents so they aren't under-or-over allocated.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">SLA goals</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Service Desk comes with an SLA such as time to first response and time to resolution. This report will tell you whether your team is able to achieve these SLA goals or not. The report displays the percentage of successful achievement for the SLA in the last seven days. These reports can quickly tell you how the team's performing in resolving issues measured by time-bound goals.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Satisfaction</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This report will display the average customer satisfaction. This usually helps you understand whether your customers are happy with your service or not. It displays an average of ratings given by the users. It's a nice and quick way to get general feedback from users and can help you understand their satisfaction level.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Requests deflected</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>If you've linked a Confluence space with your project, then this report shows the number of times articles were viewed and how many customers found those articles useful, and hence didn't raise any tickets and were able to serve themselves. Jira Service Desk is closely integrated with the Confluence space by providing related articles to the user while they're raising a new request, which might be a known issue or a very common request. In such cases, an article in the linked Confluence space can help users to serve themselves.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Requests resolved</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This reports shows the number of requests resolved with an article, requests resolved without an article, and requests deflected in the portal. The statistics shown here will help you to understand the effectiveness of your knowledge base.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Created versus resolved</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This reports displays the number of issues created versus resolved for the selected duration such as the past seven days, the past 14 days, or the past 30 days. A similar report is usually present in non-Jira Service Desk projects too.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Time to resolution</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This report shows how much time is taken to resolve all of the issues, along with how much time is taken to resolve issues of a particular type, such as incidents.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">SLA met versus breached</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>This is a simple count of how many issues achieved their SLA goal versus how many issues didn't achieve their SLA goals or, in other words, were breached.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Incidents reported by priority</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>A count of issues based on individual priorities is displayed in this report. It's useful to get a quick glimpse of the issue count broken up by priorities such as highest, high, medium, low, and lowest.</p>
<p>There're other similar reports available in a Jira Service Desk project that you can also customize further; you can also create your own.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, you learned how to use Jira Service Desk in your instance and understood the various configuration options it has to offer to make projects more relevant to your business needs.</p>
<p>Now you have enough knowledge of Jira fundamentals and you know how Jira Core, Jira Software, and Jira Desk Service projects are different from each other and their unique offerings. In the next chapter, we'll start with customizing Jira, which is applicable to all three types of Jira applications. We'll first start with understanding the concept of Jira Schemes and then we'll learn how to customize a workflow in our project.</p>
