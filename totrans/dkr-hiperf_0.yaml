- en: Docker is a great tool to build and deploy our applications. Its portable container
    format allows us to run code anywhere, from our developer workstations to popular
    cloud computing providers. The workflow around Docker makes development, testing,
    and deployment easier and faster. However, this is very important to Docker's
    internals and continuously improving best practices to realize its full potential.
