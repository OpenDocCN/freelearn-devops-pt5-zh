- en: The aim of this book is to give you the knowledge and the broad set of tools
    needed to build cloud-native applications using Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a powerful
    technology that gives engineers powerful tools to build cloud-native platforms
    using containers. The project itself is constantly evolving and contains many
    different tools to tackle common scenarios.

- en: For the layout of this book, rather than sticking to any one niche area of the
    Kubernetes toolset, we will first give you a thorough summary of the most important
    parts of default Kubernetes functionality – giving you all the skills you need
    in order to run applications on Kubernetes. Then, we'll give you the tools you
    need in order to deal with security and troubleshooting for Kubernetes in a day
    2 scenario. Finally, we'll go past the boundaries of Kubernetes itself and look
    at some powerful patterns and technologies to build on top of Kubernetes – such
    as service meshes and serverless.

    containers that have changed since publishing. Other illustrative examples may
    use containers that do not publicly exist in Docker Hub. These examples should
    be used as a basis for running your own application containers.
