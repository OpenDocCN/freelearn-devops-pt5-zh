			<p>Welcome to <em class="italic">Infrastructure as Code for Beginners</em>, your guide to managing and deploying your infrastructure through code. This book will equip you with a strong foundation in the essential concepts, tools, and techniques necessary to succeed in this ever-changing landscape.</p>
			<p>Throughout the chapters, you will gain hands-on experience with popular Infrastructure-as-Code tools such as Terraform and Ansible, learn how to plan and deploy resources across leading public cloud providers such as Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services, and delve into best practices and troubleshooting strategies to help you overcome challenges and optimize your deployments.</p>
			<p>As you progress through the book, you’ll also explore the role of Continuous Integration and <strong class="bold">Continuous Deployment</strong> (<strong class="bold">CI/CD</strong>) in automating your Infrastructure-as-Code projects using GitHub Actions. You’ll learn how to leverage CI/CD to create consistent and reliable deployments and implement security practices to secure your deployments.</p>
			<p>Furthermore, you’ll expand your Infrastructure-as-Code toolset by exploring alternative tools such as Pulumi, Azure Bicep, and AWS CloudFormation, enhancing your understanding of provider-specific and cloud-agnostic options.</p>
			<p>By the end of this journey, you’ll have gained the knowledge and confidence to plan, build, deploy, and manage your Infrastructure-as-Code projects enabling you to create efficient, scalable, and reliable infrastructure solutions that will support your projects and career for years to come.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p><a id="_idTextAnchor006"/>This book is tailored for Developers and System Administrators who have experience of manually deploying resources to host their applications but now want to increase their skills by automating the creation and management of infrastructure alongside their applications.</p>
			<p>This book will empower readers who, while having a great deal of experience deploying and configuring their resources manually, now want to streamline their processes, enhance efficiency and consistency, and integrate Infrastructure as Code into their daily workflows.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor007"/>What this book covers</h1>
			<p>In <a href="B19537_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor023"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a><em class="italic">, Choosing the Right Approach – Declarative or Imperative</em>, we introduce fundamental Infrastructure-as-Code concepts, covering the challenges of manual infrastructure management, declarative versus imperative approaches, and the <em class="italic">pets versus cattle</em> analogy, setting the stage for understanding its importance in modern deployments.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B19537_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor085"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a><em class="italic">, Ansible and Terraform beyond the Documentation, </em>we delve into Terraform, an Infrastructure-as-Code tool by HashiCorp, and Ansible,<a id="_idTextAnchor008"/> a configuration management tool by Red Hat. We will explore tool selection criteria, be introduced to Terraform and Ansible, and review some guidance on using Visual Studio Code as an IDE for writing code, including some recommended extensions.</p>
			<p>In<em class="italic"> </em><a href="B19537_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a><em class="italic">, Planning the Deployment,</em> we highlight the importance of planning in your Infrastructure-as-Code deployments. You will be introduced to the workload to be deployed, learn about deployment approaches, and explore a step-by-step guide for efficient and error-free execution. We will also examine the high-level infrastructure architecture, preparing us for our upcoming Azure and AWS deployment.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B19537_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor151"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a><em class="italic">, Deploying to Microsoft Azure, we</em> explore deploying our project to Microsoft Azure, one of the two major public cloud providers covered in this book. Topics include introducing Azure, preparing the cloud environment, creating the low-level design, and using Terraform and Ansible for writing and deploying the infrastructure code.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B19537_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor268"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a><em class="italic">, Deploying to Amazon Web Services, we</em> move onto deploying the project to <strong class="bold">Amazon Web Services</strong> (<strong class="bold">AWS</strong>) while highlighting the key differences between Azure and AWS. We will delve deeper into Ansible for deployment and gain insights into using both Ansible and Terraform for managing AWS resources. By the end of the chapter, you will understand how to adapt your deployment approach for different cloud providers.</p>
			<p>In <a href="B19537_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor350"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a><em class="italic">, Building upon the Foundations, we delve</em> into the nuances of deploying high-level designs across public cloud providers using cloud-agnostic tools such as Terraform and Ansible. We will learn from my experiences of addressing variations between providers, exploring practical approaches for creating repeatable deployment processes, and looking at the importance of modular code, allowing for streamlined deployment efforts and code reusability.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">In </em><a href="B19537_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor431"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a><em class="italic">, Leveraging CI/CD in the Cloud, w</em>e will now focus on using CI/CD to automate infrastructure deployment. We will explore GitHub Actions, a popular CI/CD tool, and learn how to use it to run Terraform and Ansible code for both Azure and AWS.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">In </em><a href="B19537_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor509"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a><em class="italic">, Common Troubleshooting Tips and Best Practices,</em> we will learn essential strategies for planning, writing, and troubleshooting Infrastructure-as-Code projects. The chapter covers best practices and troubleshooting tips for Infrastructure as Code in general and specific guidance for Terraform and Ansible. By understanding the unique challenges associated with each tool, you will be better prepared to handle obstacles that may arise during your Infrastructure-as-Code journey.</p>
			<p><em class="italic">In </em><a href="B19537_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor545"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a><em class="italic">, Exploring Alternative Infrastructure-as-Code Tools</em>, we will expand our Infrastructure-as-Code toolset by exploring three additional tools: Pulumi, Azure Bicep, and AWS CloudFormation. The chapter aims to provide hands-on understanding and knowledge of these tools, highlighting the differences between cloud-agnostic and provider-specific tools and showcasing Pulumi’s unique approach using familiar programming languages.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-8"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>To get the most out of this book</h1>
			<p>Before starting, you should understand how you would approach and deploy the infrastructure to support one or more of your existing applications. Ideally, this infrastructure would be hosted in <a id="_idTextAnchor010"/>either Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services.</p>
			<p>While this is optional, the book has been written with the assumption that you have a basic understanding of either Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services and some of the core services’ basic concepts, such as networking or virtual machines. While this is not essential, you may have to do some further reading about why we approached tasks in a certain way regarding some of the more hands-on chapters.</p>
			<p>We also assume that you would like to follow along with some of the more practical chapters; therefore, having credits or access to a Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services account that isn’t used to host production resources is a bonus.</p>
