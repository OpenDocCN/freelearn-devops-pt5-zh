<p><a href="8ebfdd27-ad3c-43ef-8ff2-a9bc8c510c98.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 1</a>, <em>Customize Application Navigation</em><span>, explores the Site Map Designer, which is a new web-based tool, introduced in Dynamics 365 CRM, which lets the customizer quickly define navigation within an app. Previously, one had to export the Sitemap XML and update it manually in the XML editor, or had to use some third-party tools. The built-in Site Map Designer makes editing the site map for an application much easier<em>.</em></span></p>
<p><a href="e7404a4e-56fd-4a70-80dc-4ed291d7f654.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 2</a>, <em>Design Apps Using App Module Designer</em><span>, covers App Module Designer, which makes it easy to add components to a specific app for users. Basically, an app is a collection of related entities, dashboards, and business process flows streamlined in such a way that end users can see only those components of Dynamics 365 CRM that matter to them.</span></p>
<p><a href="13e4c2a1-7068-4cc8-beb2-c63e2bf540fc.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 3</a>, <em>Define Processes Using Visual Process Designer</em><span>,<em> </em>explains Visual Process Designer, which brings drag-and-drop design capabilities to Dynamics 365 CRM for business process flows. Business Process Flow in Microsoft Dynamics 365 CRM  is a tool meant to help guide users through a business process in the system.<em> </em></span></p>

It has been enhanced with a complete UI overhaul, from being a step-by-step action addition to a drag-and-drop action addition.</span></p>
<p><a href="76415837-c039-46df-b4e6-3d092210e2cd.xhtml" target="_blank">Chapter 5</a>, <em>Creating Custom Business Apps</em><span>, explains PowerApps, which provides templates to build custom Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications. Microsoft PowerApps allows users at any level in an enterprise to create usable mobile apps.</span></p>

It is a cloud-based tool that can be easily used by Power Users without the need for a developer's help. The automated workflows are called flows. To create a flow, the user specifies the actions that should take place when a specific event occurs.</span></p>

It replaces OData and, eventually, SOAP-based services in Dynamics 365 CRM. It is based on the OAuth v2.0 and Open Data Protocol (OData) v4.0 standards. Both of these technologies are well established and are platform-agnostic. So, it can be consumed from different types of applications on different platforms.</span></p>

<p><span>This book assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of Dynamics CRM and would like to learn the new features introduced in Dynamics 365. However, someone who hasn’t worked with the previous versions and is starting afresh with Dynamics 365 will equally benefit from it. Developers, customizers, administrators, and power users will be able to enhance their skills by learning about the latest features and changes introduced in Dynamics 365.</span></p>
<p><span>You can try out all the features and topics mentioned in the book using a trial instance of Dynamics 365 (</span><a href="https://trials.dynamics.com/" target="_blank">https://trials.dynamics.com/</a>) <span>along with the free community edition of Visual Studio 2017 (</span><a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/" target="_blank">https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/community/</a>). <span>Some of the topics covered do not apply to the on-premise version of Dynamics 365.</span></p>
