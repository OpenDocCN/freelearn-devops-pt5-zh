- en: Software engineering teams are rapidly adopting containers to package and deploy
    their software. Providing a platform-agnostic experience, containers allow you
    to run applications with a variety of operating system images and to deploy on-premises,
    in data centers, and in the cloud. In order to support container-based applications,
    vendors have developed a wide variety of tools, ranging from Docker and Google's
    Kubernetes project to Lyft's Envoy service mesh and Netflix's Spinnaker. Whether
    you are working on the software development side of the house, hosting, and infrastructure,
    or constructing DevOps pipelines, you need both a broad and in-depth understanding
    of many concepts in order to manage container-based environments.

- en: In *Docker for Developers*, we will start with a walk-through of the basics
    of developing with containers locally using Docker, and then move on to deploying
    production-ready, cloud-hosted systems with AWS. If you are interested in learning
    about container orchestration, deployment, monitoring, and security, then we think
    you will enjoy this book.

- en: '*Docker for Developers* is geared toward engineers and DevOps personnel who
    want to learn the basics of containers and then build upon this knowledge to understand
    how to use containers in production, through a set of successively more sophisticated
    deployments. We will demonstrate how Docker applications can be deployed via CI/CD
    pipelines and managed in a production-grade, cloud-hosted environment. A basic
    understanding of containers would be helpful when tackling the book''s subject
    matter, but this is not essential. It is assumed that readers of this book are
    familiar with Linux, the use of command-line tools, and basic software engineering
    concepts, such as version control and using Git.'
