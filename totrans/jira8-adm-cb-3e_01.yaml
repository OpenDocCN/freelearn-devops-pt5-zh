- en: Atlassian Jira is a popular issue tracking system used by many companies across
    the Globe. One of its strengths, unlike most other enterprise software, is that
    it does not take days or weeks to install and implement, and is very simple to
    upgrade and maintain.

- en: We will assume that you already know how to install a brand-new Jira system.
    So, we will explore common administration tasks, such as upgrading and migrating
    your Jira, and we'll look at different options, ranging from using the new automated
    upgrade utility provided by Atlassian to doing everything from scratch. We will
    also look at some other neat tricks for you as an administrator, such as resetting
    the admin password to get you out of sticky situations.

    Jira Classic before Jira 7), Jira Software (which is Jira Core plus agile capabilities),
    and Jira Service Desk (which is Jira Core plus the old Jira Service Desk add-on),
    recipes in this book will use the term Jira to refer to the most popular of the
    three, Jira Software.
