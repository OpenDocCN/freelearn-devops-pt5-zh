		<div><h1 id="_idParaDest-24"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor023"/>Chapter 2</em>: Working with Project Templates</h1>
			<p>Over my years of working as a Jira administrator and Atlassian community leader, I have seen countless requests for and questions about creating projects based on <strong class="bold">templates</strong>. As you can imagine, there are many different mindsets as to what a <em class="italic">template</em> looks like for a project. Some want to create a custom template that satisfies the particular need they have, while others just want something quick and easy they can click on that will build the basic project objects needed.</p>
			<p>Regardless of the motivation or exact need, the general concept that the user is looking for is a fast way to create a project that already has built-in schemes and objects—such as a board or list/queue—that mostly aligns with their basic requirement.</p>
			<p>Historically, all of the Jira family of products—Jira Core (now <strong class="bold">Jira Work Management</strong>, or <strong class="bold">JWM</strong>), <strong class="bold">Jira Software</strong> (<strong class="bold">JSW</strong>), and Jira Service Desk (now <strong class="bold">Jira Service Management</strong>, or <strong class="bold">JSM</strong>)—have provided a single unique set of objects automatically created based on the tool used to create a project.</p>
			<p>Although the user still cannot create their own custom <em class="italic">template</em>, it was—and still is— possible to create a project based on an existing project that will provide a commonly shared set of schemes and objects. We will explore the details of that in <a href="B17952_09_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor145"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Duplicating Projects and Starting Outside of the Box</em>.</p>
			<p>But in this chapter, we'll look at how JWM now brings a large set of preexisting templates (more than 20!) that allow the user to create a project based on a variety of functions, including major groups for the templates. This chapter will also explore the differences in each of the available templates and the underlying components, such as the workflow and board columns.</p>
			<p>We are going to cover the following main topics in this chapter:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What are JWM templates?</li>
				<li>How are JWM templates grouped?</li>
				<li>Exploring the information available for templates</li>
				<li>Deciding which template to use</li>
				<li>New terms learned in this chapter</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Upon completion of this chapter, you will be able to describe the purpose and function of project templates for JWM projects and the groupings they roughly fall into. You will also be able to find and identify the various templates available. Templates will be your best way to create a new project, so knowing which templates are available and what they contain will be beneficial as you get started.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-25"><a id="_idTextAnchor024"/>Technical requirements</h1>
			<p>As JWM is only available in the Jira Cloud environment, the requirement for this chapter is simple: <em class="italic">access to a Jira Cloud environment</em>.</p>
			<p>If you already have access to Jira Cloud, that's great—you are ready to go! If not, Atlassian provides a free JWM account for up to 10 users. You can create your account by going to <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free">https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-core&amp;edition=free</a> and following the instructions.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-26"><a id="_idTextAnchor025"/>What are JWM templates?</h1>
			<p>Project <a id="_idIndexMarker039"/>templates provide the user with a quick start for a project by automatically creating several technical components necessary to administer and use the project. We have already described in <a href="B17952_01_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor013"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">Why Choose Jira Work Management?,</em> how the process of creating a new project has the user pass through a phase of selecting a template to use. This is a necessary step as it establishes the workflow for cards on the project as well as columns that will appear on the board.</p>
			<p>The steps in the workflow directly correlate to statuses for the project. Some common steps/statuses are <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong>, <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong>, <strong class="bold">DONE</strong>, and so on. Column names on the board will be the same as the status names. See the section entitled <em class="italic">How to read a workflow</em> later in this chapter for more on relationships between statuses.</p>
			<p>Along with the board and workflow, other schemes will be automatically attached to the project for screens, permissions, and notifications. We will discuss how to administer and work with those objects in more detail in <a href="B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes</em>. Most of the project templates can be grouped or associated together along common themes or functions. We will explore that next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-27"><a id="_idTextAnchor026"/>How are JVM templates grouped?</h2>
			<p>There is not a hard and <a id="_idIndexMarker040"/>fast grouping of JWM templates. However, there were some themes in mind when the current list of templates was planned and built as the starter set for business projects.</p>
			<p>Some of the templates will span multiple groupings or themes, such as those relating to task management and planning and content management. I will lump those into a group that I will simply call the <strong class="bold">Basic Group</strong>. </p>
			<p>Again, templates might fall into multiple themes, but here is my take on groups, along with the templates that fall into each. This is only intended as a rough guide for the types of project templates that are available, but I think it is a beneficial guide to allow you to narrow your focus when selecting a new template.</p>
			<h3>Basic Group</h3>
			<p>These are common templates that many projects will use and are generic in terms of subject matter.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Content Management</strong>: Manage <a id="_idIndexMarker041"/>the content life cycle from prioritization through to draft and delivery.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Task Tracking</strong>: Organize tasks for a team or a personal project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Personal Task Planner</strong>: Stay organized and tackle your personal tasks easily.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Human Resources (HR)</h3>
			<p>These templates help with a variety to HR functions from prior to hiring to working with current employees.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Recruitment</strong>: Monitor<a id="_idIndexMarker042"/> candidates and potential hires from application to offer.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">New Employee Onboarding</strong>: Track the progression of new hires, all the way from offer acceptance to day 1 on the job.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Performance Review</strong>: Standardize your employees' performance evaluations and the peer-review process.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Finance</h3>
			<p>Financial projects can cover a wide range, including inventory or assets as well as reporting periods and budgeting.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Asset Creation</strong>: Streamline <a id="_idIndexMarker043"/>the process of managing incoming asset creation requests.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Budget Creation</strong>: Get everyone on the same page during the budget creation process.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Month-end Close</strong>: Manage and simplify your month-end close process.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Procurement</strong>: Standardize your procurement process and track all purchases from request to receipt.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">RFP Process</strong>: Roll out<a id="_idIndexMarker044"/> your <strong class="bold">request for proposal</strong> (<strong class="bold">RFP</strong>) process so that you can select<a id="_idIndexMarker045"/> the right vendor for the right job.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Legal</h3>
			<p>These templates have specialized workflows which assist in the normal process for legal file preparations.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Document Approval</strong>: Manage <a id="_idIndexMarker046"/>documents from creation to approval.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">IP Infringement</strong>: Handle claims efficiently and quickly for <strong class="bold">intellectual property</strong> (<strong class="bold">IP</strong>) infringement.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Policy Management</strong>: Track the moving parts involved in managing policies and procedures.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Marketing/Sales</h3>
			<p>Marketing and sales type projects tend to follow some common campaign processes or journeys. These templates will be especially helpful in that area due to how the workflows are organized.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Campaign Management</strong>: Drive a<a id="_idIndexMarker047"/> marketing campaign from idea to execution.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Email Campaign</strong>: Plan and execute email campaigns.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Go-to-Market</strong>: Coordinate<a id="_idIndexMarker048"/> a <strong class="bold">go-to-market</strong> (<strong class="bold">GTM</strong>) launch for your product or business.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Lead Tracking</strong>: Track sales leads from opportunity through to close.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Sales Pipeline</strong>: Manage your sales pipeline from lead to converted customer, all in one place.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Web Design Process</strong>: For designers and developers to track web design tasks and stay aligned.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Operations</h3>
			<p>Most organizations are going to have need for simple project and task related processes. This grouping provides clear focus on getting events and tasks done.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project Management</strong>: Manage<a id="_idIndexMarker049"/> activities for completing a business project.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Process Control</strong>: Track activities and tasks for recurring processes.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Event Planning</strong>: Empower teams in their planning for the next event, big or small.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, we will delve into the details of each template and cover some basics of how to read a workflow.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-28"><a id="_idTextAnchor027"/>Exploring the information available for templates</h1>
			<p>In the previous<a id="_idIndexMarker050"/> section, we listed the standard set of project templates that come <em class="italic">out of the box</em> with JWM. However, in the subsections to come, there will be more details provided for each template. These details will include general explanations of why each template is provided, along with the <strong class="bold">issue types</strong> and <strong class="bold">workflow</strong> connected to the template.</p>
			<p>The intention is for the text to help guide you as to when each template might best be used. The issue types will provide some clarity as to the type of work best suited for the templates and the statuses or steps in the workflow that will be aligned with the project.</p>
			<p>It should be noted that the pages to follow will be mostly screenshots of the current JWM templates at the time of writing this book. As Atlassian has gone to a concerted effort to create, configure and detail the templates, it is a good idea to let the tool speak for itself for those descriptions. Keep in mind that the current templates available in the product might be somewhat different in comparison to what is provided here.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-29"><a id="_idTextAnchor028"/>Issue types, workflow, and board relationships</h2>
			<p>These <a id="_idIndexMarker051"/>are some <a id="_idIndexMarker052"/>of the most <a id="_idIndexMarker053"/>basic, yet powerful parts of JSW and JWM projects, but how they are configured in the two tools also provides some of the largest differences in the tools. We will not belabor the point too much by detailing the workings of JSW projects here, but we will note the relations of these major components for JWM.</p>
			<p>Historically, it is the board that provides the most vivid visualization of the work being done on a project or by a team. Whether it be a Kanban or a Sprint board, it is undeniably powerful to see the cards and their progress on the board.</p>
			<p>Simply put, boards are made up of <a id="_idIndexMarker054"/>horizontal rows called <em class="italic">swimlanes</em> and vertical columns that represent the activities performed on the project, such as design, development, or testing. In JWM projects, these columns will be a one-to-one match with the statuses in the project workflow.</p>
			<p>Currently, JWM projects do not allow multiple workflows to be associated with a board. Therefore, while there might be multiple issue types associated with the project, all issue types must be associated with one and only one workflow. We will go into more depth about configuring and modifying components in <a href="B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes</em>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-30"><a id="_idTextAnchor029"/>How to read a workflow</h2>
			<p>As we will be<a id="_idIndexMarker055"/> showing many details about each template, including workflow images, this seems like a good time to discuss how to read a workflow. At a quick glance, we see that workflows are made up of <strong class="bold">statuses</strong> (think steps) and <strong class="bold">transitions</strong> (think paths). The workflows that follow help guide the user by providing named transitions from one status to the next. See <em class="italic">Figure 2.1</em> and <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em> as visual references to our discussion here.</p>
			<p>Statuses appear as different colored boxes, while transitions are lines connecting the statuses or identifying the path from one status to another. <em class="italic">Figure 2.1</em> and <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em> have the names of the transitions turned on so that it is easier to tell the direction of the flow as well as describe the action taking place. It is always good to name transitions using a verb when possible.</p>
			<p>The workflow begins with a gray circle and a <strong class="bold">Create</strong> transition. Note that cards might flow in either direction. The placement of the words on the transition denotes the direction of the flow—so, in this example, when an issue is created, it will land in the <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong> status. From there, the issue can only move forward to the <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> status using a <strong class="bold">Start Progress</strong> transition.</p>
			<p>Once an issue is in progress, it can either travel forward to the <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> status using a <strong class="bold">Done</strong> transition or return to the <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong> status via a <strong class="bold">Stop Progress</strong> transition. Finally, from the <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> status, an issue might be reopened and return to the <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong> status for a <strong class="bold">Reopen</strong> transition, or it might return to the <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> status by using a <strong class="bold">Reopen and start progress</strong> transition.</p>
			<p>Notice in the following screenshot that all statuses fall into one of three categories—<strong class="bold">TO DO</strong> (the box under the <strong class="bold">Create</strong> transition heading), <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> (far-right box), or <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> (bottom box). In this case, it just so happens that the status names also match with the status<a id="_idIndexMarker056"/> category names:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.1_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.1 – Simple workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.1 – Simple workflow</p>
			<p>It should be noted that a status may have a single <strong class="bold">All</strong> transition attached to it, as in the following screenshot. This simply means that the flow of a card can go from any other status in the workflow to that status. Otherwise, cards must move in a linear fashion from one<a id="_idIndexMarker057"/> step to the next, as in <em class="italic">Figure 2.2</em>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.2_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.2 – Workflow utilizing All transitions&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.2 – Workflow utilizing All transitions</p>
			<p>Now that we have some basics on how to read templates, let's delve into some details.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-31"><a id="_idTextAnchor030"/>Project Management</h2>
			<p>This first <a id="_idIndexMarker058"/>template<a id="_idIndexMarker059"/> is perhaps the most used template for JWM projects and is a great template to use to create your first business project. The name is generic on purpose and covers a wide range of instances where the template can be used. You can see a representation of this template here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.3_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.3 – Project Management template&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.3 – Project Management template</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Project Management</strong> template<a id="_idIndexMarker060"/> is the<a id="_idIndexMarker061"/> same as we used as the example in <em class="italic">Figure 2.1</em>. It is very simple in nature and provides an easy start to using JWM projects. The workflow is represented here:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.4_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.4 – Project Management workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.4 – Project Management workflow</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-32"><a id="_idTextAnchor031"/>Task Tracking</h2>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker062"/>simplest <a id="_idIndexMarker063"/>of the initial set of project templates, the <strong class="bold">Task Tracking</strong> template is all about providing a quick way of implementing a traditional to-do list. The twist is that you can use a two-tiered approach with both <strong class="bold">Task</strong> and <strong class="bold">Sub-task</strong> issue types, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.5_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.5 – Task Tracking template&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.5 – Task Tracking template</p>
			<p>This is a<a id="_idIndexMarker064"/> very<a id="_idIndexMarker065"/> straightforward workflow that goes from <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong> to <strong class="bold">DONE</strong>, as illustrated in the following screenshot. It can be reopened if necessary:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.6_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.6 – Task Tracking workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.6 – Task Tracking workflow</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-33"><a id="_idTextAnchor032"/>Content Management</h2>
			<p>Today's <a id="_idIndexMarker066"/>world is<a id="_idIndexMarker067"/> awash with content. Between blogs and websites and postings of every kind, we need some help with managing the creation of all that information. The <strong class="bold">Content Management</strong> template provides a single issue type of <strong class="bold">Asset</strong> with a simple but efficient workflow, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.7_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.7 – Content Management template&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.7 – Content Management template</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker068"/>workflow <a id="_idIndexMarker069"/>provides a path for creating a draft, having it reviewed and then approved, and finally sending it off to the world by publishing it. There is flexibility provided in the review and draft stages to allow for any needed revisions, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.8_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.8 – Content Management workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.8 – Content Management workflow</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-34"><a id="_idTextAnchor033"/>Document Approval</h2>
			<p>Very similar <a id="_idIndexMarker070"/>to the <strong class="bold">Content Management</strong> template<a id="_idIndexMarker071"/> is the <strong class="bold">Document Approval </strong>template. Again, with the amount of information being produced in the current age, there continues to be a growing need for processes related to documents and content. You can see a representation of this template in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.9_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.9 – Document Approval template&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.9 – Document Approval template</p>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker072"/> workflow<a id="_idIndexMarker073"/> is also very linear in following a path of creating a draft, having it reviewed (in this case, possibly reviewed twice), and then getting it approved, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.10_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.10 – Document Approval workflow&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.10 – Document Approval workflow</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-35"><a id="_idTextAnchor034"/>Web Design Process</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Web Design Process</strong> template <a id="_idIndexMarker074"/>follows <a id="_idIndexMarker075"/>more of an ideation thought process, where an idea is formulated, a design is created, and the resulting wireframes or sketches are tested. Finally, the product is launched after all the steps have been reviewed and agreed upon. You can see a representation of this template in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.11_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.11 – Web Design Process template&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.11 – Web Design Process template</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker076"/>workflow <a id="_idIndexMarker077"/>has a classic <strong class="bold">All</strong> transitions concept whereby cards can flow easily back and forth between each step, allowing for maximum collaboration, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.12_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.12 – Web Design Process workflow&#13;&#10;"/>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-36"><a id="_idTextAnchor035"/>Recruitment</h2>
			<p>Employees<a id="_idIndexMarker078"/> seem<a id="_idIndexMarker079"/> to be on the move more than ever now, with working-from-home schemes and migrations of positions across states, provinces, and even country borders. The <strong class="bold">Recruitment</strong> template, as illustrated in the following screenshot, provides for the process of receiving candidates and tracking them through the hiring process:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.13_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.13 – Recruitment template&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.13 – Recruitment template</p>
			<p>The workflow<a id="_idIndexMarker080"/> for <a id="_idIndexMarker081"/>recruiting is more linear in nature, with off-ramps available at a variety of points to reject any candidates not syncing with the position. Interviews are done, debriefs and discussions happen, and the final outcome of the candidate is decided upon, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.14_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.14 – Recruitment workflow&#13;&#10;"/>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-37"><a id="_idTextAnchor036"/>New Employee Onboarding</h2>
			<p>After your <a id="_idIndexMarker082"/>successful <a id="_idIndexMarker083"/>use of the Recruitment project, it is time to onboard your new employee! Get your employees started off right by collecting and reviewing pertinent documents, setting up computers and <strong class="bold">information technology</strong> (<strong class="bold">IT</strong>) equipment, and then be ready to welcome them on their first day. You can see a representation of the <strong class="bold">New Employee Onboarding</strong> template in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.15_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.15 – New Employee Onboarding template&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.15 – New Employee Onboarding template</p>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker084"/> workflow is<a id="_idIndexMarker085"/> fairly simple and provides for much flexibility as each of the statuses uses the <strong class="bold">All</strong> transition, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.16_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.16 – New Employee Onboarding workflow&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.16 – New Employee Onboarding workflow</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-38"><a id="_idTextAnchor037"/>Performance Review</h2>
			<p>Now that those <a id="_idIndexMarker086"/>new employees are<a id="_idIndexMarker087"/> onboarded and at work, you will eventually need to carry out a <strong class="bold">performance review</strong> on each person. This template provides easy tracking of these reviews by utilizing issue types for the employee, tasks, and sub-tasks. The combination provides for full coverage and is illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.17_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.17 – Performance Review template&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.17 – Performance Review template</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker088"/>workflow<a id="_idIndexMarker089"/> provides for different levels of review, culminating in a decision that can then be shared with the employee, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.18_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.18 – Performance Review workflow&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.18 – Performance Review workflow</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-39"><a id="_idTextAnchor038"/>Lead Tracking</h2>
			<p>As the<a id="_idIndexMarker090"/> name<a id="_idIndexMarker091"/> implies, the <strong class="bold">Lead Tracking</strong> template utilizes the <strong class="bold">Lead</strong> issue type to follow sales opportunities through the sales cycle. Sales pipelines are the lifeblood of revenue-producing streams, and losing track of opportunities or allowing them to stall unnoticed can have significant impacts on a company. You can see a representation of this template in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.19_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.19 – Lead Tracking template&#13;&#10;"/>

			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.19 – Lead Tracking template</p>
			<p>Use the<a id="_idIndexMarker092"/> workflow <a id="_idIndexMarker093"/>to record the wins and losses experienced in your pipeline while tracking through initial contacts, negotiations, and the final outcome, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-40"><a id="_idTextAnchor039"/>Procurement</h2>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Procurement</strong> template<a id="_idIndexMarker094"/> helps to ensure<a id="_idIndexMarker095"/> that your project keeps track of your purchase orders as well as recurring needs from year to year. Use due dates to guide your priorities and note the details of orders. You can see a representation of this template in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>One <a id="_idIndexMarker098"/>philosophy of sales is the more contacts<a id="_idIndexMarker099"/> and opportunities, the better. Another is to focus on solid leads produced by well-thought-out campaigns for a higher percentage of conversions. Either way, a <strong class="bold">sales pipeline</strong> is crucial to support both. Track your customers with this template, from first contact to the close. You can see a representation of the <strong class="bold">Sales Pipeline</strong> template in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Sales<a id="_idIndexMarker100"/> pipelines <a id="_idIndexMarker101"/>tend to have more of a linear workflow, but this one allows for flexibility in the path as well. With <strong class="bold">Won</strong> and <strong class="bold">Lost</strong> statuses, it will also be easy to report on the results of opportunities. You can see an illustration of the workflow here:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-42"><a id="_idTextAnchor041"/>Email Campaign</h2>
			<p>Let's <a id="_idIndexMarker102"/>face it—email<a id="_idIndexMarker103"/> is NOT dead! <strong class="bold">Email campaigns</strong> are still an effective way to reach customers and communicate sales, product offerings, company news, and more. This template incorporates <strong class="bold">Asset</strong>, <strong class="bold">Task</strong>, and <strong class="bold">Sub-task</strong> issue types to help track emails themselves and the efforts needed to produce them. You can see a representation of the <strong class="bold">Email Campaign</strong> template in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.25 – Email Campaign template</p>
			<p>There are <a id="_idIndexMarker104"/>several<a id="_idIndexMarker105"/> types of email campaigns that an organization can use, so this workflow provides the flexibility to skip columns when needed or proceed in a linear path, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-43"><a id="_idTextAnchor042"/>Budget Creation</h2>
			<p>Few people<a id="_idIndexMarker106"/> like to create a budget, but <a id="_idIndexMarker107"/>they are very necessary to help control your finances. The <strong class="bold">Budget Creation</strong> template helps to pass a budget along for feedback, reviews, and approvals. At the end of the process, you can track approvals. You can see a representation of this template in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_2.27_B17952.jpg" alt="Figure 2.27 – Budget Creation template&#13;&#10;"/>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.27 – Budget Creation template</p>
			<p>Some<a id="_idIndexMarker108"/> budgets<a id="_idIndexMarker109"/> are more involved than others and need to pass through each step of the workflow. Others can skip columns that do not apply with these flexible steps of the <strong class="bold">All</strong> transitions, as illustrated in the following screenshot:</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-44"><a id="_idTextAnchor043"/>Personal Task Planner</h2>
			<p>There<a id="_idIndexMarker110"/> is a<a id="_idIndexMarker111"/> myriad of <strong class="bold">personal task planners</strong> available to us. They appear in many different styles and formats. But why not just have Jira help you with what it does best—tracking tasks! Even at a personal level, a project built from the personal task planner will integrate well with other projects in your instance and provide a single place to see all of your work. You can see a representation of the <strong class="bold">Personal Task Planner</strong> template in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 2.29 – Personal Task Planner template</p>
			<p>The<a id="_idIndexMarker112"/> workflow<a id="_idIndexMarker113"/> cannot get much simpler than this—the classic <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong>, <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong>, <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> format that involves just one status of each category. Issues will be placed in the <strong class="bold">TO DO</strong> status when created and then moved to <strong class="bold">IN PROGRESS</strong> when started. Finally, the issue is simply moved to <strong class="bold">DONE</strong> when completed. You can see an illustration of the workflow in the following screenshot:</p>

			<p>Wow, that's a lot of templates! And it doesn't even show all of the current ones that exist for you to use. Next, let's take a look at some guidance for which template to use.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-45"><a id="_idTextAnchor044"/>Deciding which template to use</h1>
			<p>With the <a id="_idIndexMarker114"/>outstanding list of built-in templates to use for JWM projects, which one should you use? Of course, the first clue is to ask yourself: <em class="italic">What am I trying to accomplish?</em> And the next logical step is to take a look at the descriptions of each project template found in the previous pages of this chapter or peruse the online descriptions within the tool itself.</p>
			<p>Pay close attention to the issue types used by the templates along with the actual workflow implemented behind the scenes for the project. As we mentioned in the <em class="italic">Issue types, workflow, and board relationships</em> section, only a single workflow will be available for all issue types in the project. Remember that the statuses in the workflow will relate to the columns that are displayed on the board.</p>
			<p>Do not get too hung up on the order of the statuses in the workflow as you will be able to rearrange the columns of the board after everything has been created. We will discuss that more in <a href="B17952_04_ePub.xhtml#_idTextAnchor062"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Modifying the Board, Workflow, and Associated Schemes</em>.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-46"><a id="_idTextAnchor045"/>New terms learned in this chapter</h1>
			<p>Let's conclude the chapter by going through a list of new terms learned in this chapter, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Project templates</strong>: A set of preconfigured components and features used to quickly create new JWM projects.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Issue type</strong>: The identification of the type of work being done. This field is required for all new issues.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Workflow</strong>: The path that work progresses through from start to finish, moving from step to step from <strong class="bold">CREATE</strong> to <strong class="bold">DONE</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Statuses</strong>: The recognized name for steps in a workflow.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Transitions</strong>: The paths from status to status in a workflow.</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-47"><a id="_idTextAnchor046"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>As mentioned earlier, JWM is different from the other Jira products partly because there are several pre-built project templates available to get you started quickly. We have explored the rough groupings of the templates, and then we did an in-depth dive into each template to explore the issue types and workflows each one uses.</p>
			<p>Now that you have this knowledge, you know that the fastest way to create a project is by using a template, and you can now quickly identify which template to use based on the details provided by the template.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will build upon the templates just discussed by creating our first project. Once that is accomplished, we will explore what is available.</p>
