    we will look into business fraud and service abuses. Cloud services introduce
    new types of security risks, such as transaction fraud, account abuses, and promotion
    code abuses. This online fraud and abuse may result in financial losses or gains,
    depending on which side of the fence you sit.

    on how to detect these kinds of behaviors. We will also discuss typical technical
    frameworks and technical approaches needed to build a service abuse prevention
