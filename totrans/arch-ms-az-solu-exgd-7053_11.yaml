    of least permissions and give users the exact permissions they need to do their
    jobs properly. Users, groups, and applications are added to roles in Azure, and
    those roles have certain permissions. You can use the built-in roles that Azure
    offers or you can create custom roles in RBAC.

    Subscription, an Azure Resource Group, or Web App, for instance. Azure then uses
    access inheritance. Roles added to a parent resource give access to child resources
    automatically. For instance, a group that is added to an Azure Subscription gets
    access to all the Resource Groups and underlying resources that are in that subscription
    as well. A user that is added to a virtual machine only gets access to that particular
    VM:'
