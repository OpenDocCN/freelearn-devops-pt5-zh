  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The journey to becoming a Docker Certified Associate is not easy. We started
    this book from the very beginning, understanding why containers are so popular
    these days when we talk about microservices architectures. Then, we described
    how containers are executed using Docker Engine, integrating various isolation
    strategies to ensure security between container-embedded processes. As containers
    are based on images, we learned how to build and maintain them using Docker tools.
    We learned about different Docker objects and how to deploy applications using
    different networking methods, volumes, or security approaches. We learned how
    to deploy microservices applications, where every component is running containers.
    We learned the differences between running all components on standalone and cluster-wide
    distributed environments. Orchestrators are key in distributed environments. They
    keep applications healthy and help us develop microservices faster to provide
    features to update applications' components without service interruption. We studied
    Docker Swarm and Kubernetes because both are part of the Docker Enterprise platform.
    Finally, we introduced Docker's enterprise-ready CaaS platform, Docker Enterprise.
    We learned about all its components and features and how they help us to deploy
    applications, as well as improving their security.

    this workflow, you are ready to take the Docker Certified Associate exam. This
    book should also be used as a command reference, although we know that technology
    changes quite fast these days. Now that you are ready to take the exam, take a
    deep breath and schedule your exam at [https://prod.examity.com/docker](https://prod.examity.com/docker).
