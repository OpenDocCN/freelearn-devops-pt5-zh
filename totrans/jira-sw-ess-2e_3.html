<p class="calibre3">In the last two chapters, we have looked at how to use Jira Software for the Scrum agile methodology. Jira Software also supports another agile methodology called Kanban, which many agile teams have chosen to use instead of Scrum. In this chapter, we will look at how to use Jira Software for Kanban.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By the end of this chapter, you will have learned how to:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Visualize workflow with Kanban</li>
<li class="calibre9">Work on issues the Kanban way</li>
<li class="calibre9">Customize your Kanban board</li>
<li class="calibre9">Create reports and charts for improvements</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Kanban</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Kanban is another agile methodology that is supported by Jira Software. Unlike Scrum (which was introduced in <a href="part0033.html#VF2I0-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre11">Chapter 2</a>, <em class="calibre2">Jira Software for Scrum</em>), which revolves around the notion of running your project in planned iterations called sprints, Kanban does not run in iterations, or rather, the use of iteration is optional with Kanban.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In a nutshell, Kanban has the following three concepts:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Visualizing workflow</strong>: This breaks down your tasks (issues) and puts them on the board. You need to organize your board so that each column represents a status in your overall workflow, ordered from left (start) to right (finish).</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Limiting the work in progress (WIP)</strong>: This sets minimum and maximum limits for how many tasks can be in any given workflow status.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Measuring the lead time</strong>: This calculates the average time required to complete one task, keeping it as low and predictable as possible.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">While Scrum requires the team to plan iterative sprints with managed scopes, and focuses on team velocity, Kanban is more flexible, as its focus is more around <strong class="calibre1">cycle time</strong>. Cycle time is the measurement of the amount of time it takes for an issue, or unit of work, to transition through the team's workflow from end to end. The goal is to reduce the cycle time, identify any problems and bottlenecks in the workflow, and address them to get the process to flow smoothly again. As we will see, Jira provides a number of tools to help with this.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating a new Kanban board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Jira Software provides a simple-to-follow wizard to help you create new Kanban boards. All you need to do is choose if you want to create a board from scratch, from an existing project, or filter, and follow the steps.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To create a new Kanban board, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Agile menu from the top navigation bar and select the Manage Boards option.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Create board button. This will bring up the Create an Agile board dialog.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select the Create a Kanban board option:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone33" src="img/00037.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="4" class="calibre14">
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Select how you want to create your board and click on the Next button. There are three options to choose from to create your board, as shown in the screenshot below. These options are explained as follows:
<ul class="calibre20">
<li class="calibre9">Board created with new Software project: This is the same as creating a project using the Scrum agile project template. A new project will be created, along with a new Kanban board dedicated to the project.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Board from an existing project: This option allows you to create a new board from your existing projects. The board will be dedicated to only one project.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Board from an existing Saved Filter: This option allows you to create a board that can span across multiple projects with the use of a filter. So, to use this option, you will first have to create a filter that includes the projects and issues you need.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have many issues in your project, then you can also use filters to limit the number of issues that are to be included.</p>
<div><img class="alignnone34" src="img/00038.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="5" class="calibre14">
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Fill in the required information for the board. Depending on the option you have selected, you will either need to provide the project details or select a filter to use. The following screenshot shows an example of creating a board with a filter. Click on the Create board button to finish:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone35" src="img/00039.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Understanding the Kanban board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">For those who are familiar with the Scrum board in Jira Software, the Kanban board will look very similar to the work mode of the Scrum board, with only a few differences:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">There is no backlog view. The backlog is the first column on the boardâ€”new issues will be added straight into the Backlog column.</li>
<li class="calibre9">There are no active sprints. Since Kanban does not have iterations, you are always in the working view.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Some of the columns may have a minimum and maximum number, which appear next to the column name.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Some of the columns may be highlighted in red or yellow, as shown in the following screenshot, where the In Progress column is highlighted in red:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class="alignnone36" src="img/00040.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">So, let's take a closer look at the Kanban board and see why we have these differences. First of all, as explained in the earlier section, Kanban does not use discrete time periods, such as iterations, to plan work in advance. Instead, work is being done constantly, going from the backlog to the finish line to be released. Therefore, the Kanban board does not have separate views for the backlog (or a Plan mode, in older versions of Jira Software) and the current active sprints (or Work mode); everything is combined into this single Kanban board view, which shows you everything in your backlog and the current progress as your team works through the issues.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first column on the board will be your backlog, and it is called Backlog by default if you are not using a customized board and/or workflow. Any new issues created will be automatically placed into that column. However, if you have a big project, you may find this hard to maintain as the number of issues grows. In this case, Jira provides an option to have a backlog view like a Scrum board by using what is known as <strong class="calibre1">Kanplan</strong>. We will cover Kanplan in <a href="part0074.html#26I9K0-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre11">Chapter 4</a>, <em class="calibre2">Using Jira Software Your Way</em>.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Customizing your Kanban board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">After you have created your Kanban board, you will need to customize it based on your workflow process and your team's capacity. Some of the key customizations include:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Modeling your board columns to mimic your workflow</li>
<li class="calibre9">Setting minimum and maximum constraints for your workflow status so as to control the work in progress</li>
<li class="calibre9">Controlling which issues will be included and displayed on the board</li>
<li class="calibre9">Categorizing issues on the Kanban board in swimlanes</li>
<li class="calibre9">Creating custom-filtered views with quick filters</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Visualizing workflow with Kanban</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">One of the core concepts of Kanban is to visualize the team's workflow to better understand what the team is currently working on, what the workload is like, and where in the workflow a given task is. So the first step is to set up your board columns to visually represent what your workflow looks like.</p>
<p class="calibre3">In Jira, workflow statuses are represented as columns on the Kanban board. To customize your Kanban board's columns, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Go to the Kanban board you want to customize.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Board drop-down menu and select the Configure option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select Columns from the left-hand navigation menu.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Click on the Add column button.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Enter a name for the new column and select a category for it. Generally speaking, if the column represents the start of the workflow, then it should be in the To Do category. If it represents the end, then it should be in the Done category. Otherwise, use the In Progress category.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to create the new column:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone37" src="img/00041.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have created the new column, it will be added as the second to last column on the list. You can rearrange its position by dragging the column left or right on the list so that it is in the correct position in your workflow.</p>
<p>When adding a column this way, a corresponding new status with the same name will also be created for you, if one does not already exist. So you do not have to create both the column and status separately.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Generally speaking, your board should reflect how work progresses through your workflow, so you should have a column for each major step that members of your team will be working on. For example, if you have the steps In Development, Development Completed, and In Testing in your workflow, you should have two columns, one for In Development and one for In Testing. The reason why you should not have a column for Development Completed is because nobody will be working on the issues that are in the step.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Setting up column constraints</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">As stated earlier, one of the key differences between Scrum and Kanban is that Scrum limits the amount of work per iteration and Kanban limits the amount of work per workflow status. This is done by setting <strong class="calibre1">column constraints</strong>. Column constraints tell Jira the maximum and/or the minimum number of issues that should be in a column at any given time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To set up column constraints, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Go to the Kanban board you want to customize.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Board drop-down menu and select the Configure option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select Columns from the left-hand navigation menu.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Choose how you want the column constraint to be calculated from the Column Constraint field. If you select the None option, column constraints will not be applied to this board.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Set the minimum and maximum constraint value for the status in its corresponding columns. For example, as shown in the following screenshot, for the Selected for Development column, the team should have a minimum of five issues, and no more than ten issues in the status:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone38" src="img/00042.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have set the minimum and maximum constraints for workflow statuses, the Kanban board will let you know if those constraints are violated. For example, as shown in the following screenshot, we only have one issue in the Selected for Development status, which has a minimum constraint of five issues, and so the column is highlighted in yellow.</p>
<p class="calibre3">We also have six issues in the In Progress status, which has a maximum constraint of five issues, so the column is highlighted in red:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone39" src="img/00043.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">When you start seeing these constraint violations, it means the team should start reassessing the current workload. Remember, the goal with Kanban is to help you identify and improve efficiency, not get in the way of your work.</p>
<p>Column constraints help you to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in your workflow, not to restrict your work process.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Controlling which issues to show on the board</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">For the Kanban board, there are two queries used to determine which issues will be displayed:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Saved Filter: The saved filter includes issues that will be displayed on the Kanban board. The Filter Query field shows the JQL query of the saved filter. Depending on how the board is created, the saved filter will be either automatically created or selected from an existing filter list.</li>
<li class="calibre9">Kanban board sub-filter: The sub-filter determines which issues from the saved filter will be considered unreleased. As we will see in a later section in this chapter, <em class="calibre2">Releasing a version in Kanban</em>, once an issue is released as part of a new version, it is removed from the board.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the following screenshot, Sample Kanban Board is using the Filter for Sample Kanban Project saved filter with the JQL query of <kbd class="calibre12">project="SampleKanbanProject"ORDERBYRankASC</kbd>. This means that all issues created in Sample Kanban Project will be shown on the board. It is also using the JQL query of <kbd class="calibre12">fixVersioninunreleasedVersions()ORfixVersionisEMPTY</kbd>, which means issues that have an unreleased version as their fix versions, or do not have a value for the field, will be considered unreleased and will be displayed on the board:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone40" src="img/00044.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">You can change both the saved filter and sub-filter used for your board. If you want to simply use a different saved filter for another filter you have, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Hover over and click on the saved filter's name. You will see it change to a select list.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the new saved filter from the list. If you do not see the filter you want, you can type in the filter's name and search for it. Note that you can only see and select filters that you have access to.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">You can also change the JQL query of the saved filter currently in use:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Edit Filter Query link under Saved Filter. This will bring you to Issue Navigator, the interface where you create and edit filters in Jira, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone41" src="img/00045.jpeg"/></div>
<ol start="2" class="calibre14">
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Update your search filter criteria via the UI controls if you are in the Basic mode, or the JQL query directly if you are in the Advanced mode.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Click on the Save button at the top to update your filter.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the preceding example, we changed our filter's query to <kbd class="calibre12">project="SampleKanbanProject"andissuetypein(Bug,Story,Task)ORDERBYRankASC</kbd>, which limits the issues to types of bugs, stories, and tasks only.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To update the board's sub-filter to customize how unreleased issues are determined, follow these steps:</p>
<ol start="1" class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Hover over and click on the Kanban board sub-filter's content. You will see it change to an editable text box.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Enter the new JQL query and click on the Update button, as follows:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone42" src="img/00046.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the preceding example, we have changed the sub-filter's query to <kbd class="calibre12">fixVersioninunreleasedVersions()ORfixVersionisEMPTYorresolutionisEMPTY</kbd>Â to also include a check for issues that do not have a value for the Resolution field.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Organizing your Kanban board with swimlanes</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3"><strong class="calibre1">Swimlanes</strong> are a useful way to group and organize your issues on your Kanban board. For example, you can use swimlanes to represent priorities and divide issues based on owners or types.</p>
<p class="calibre3">By default, when you first create a new Kanban board, you will have two swimlanes, but you can also create your own custom ones. For example, as shown in the following screenshot, we have three swimlanes: the Expedite and the Everything Else swimlanes are created along with your board, and the Bugs swimlane in the middle is a custom swimlane we have added:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone43" src="img/00047.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">To customize swimlanes for your Kanban board, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Go to the Kanban board that you want to customize swimlanes for.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Board drop-down menu and select the Configure option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select Swimlanes from the left-hand navigation menu.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Choose the criteria you want to base your swimlane on in the Base Swimlane on field.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Â </p>
<ol start="5" class="calibre14">
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Create a new swimlane by entering the name and description for the swimlane and enter the JQL query if you are basing your swimlanes on queries.</li>
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Reorder your swimlanes by dragging them up and down the list:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone44" src="img/00048.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the preceding screenshot, we have three swimlanes based on queries. The Expedite and Everything Else swimlanes were there by default when we created the board. We have a new Bugs swimlane that is using the JQL query of <kbd class="calibre12">issuetype=Bug</kbd>Â so that all issues of the Bug type will be categorized together.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Note that the order of the swimlanes is important. The order will determine both the placement of each swimlane and the swimlane that an issue will belong to. In this case, the Expedite swimlane is on the top, and this will be reflected in the final Kanban board. If we have an issue that is of the Bug type and also a value of Highest for the priority field, it will be categorized into the Expedite swimlane rather than the Bugs swimlane because of the order.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The JQL option is the most flexible way of defining swimlanes, but you can also use some of the built-in options, such as Assignee, for simpler purposes. The next screenshot shows a Kanban board with four swimlanes, each showing the issues for a user, so you can easily get an idea of how many issues are assigned to each user:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone45" src="img/00049.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Creating custom views with quick filters</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">By default, the Kanban board will display all the issues that are returned from the selected filter. However, there might be times where you need to do additional filtering on top to narrow down the list of issues further. This is where quick filters come in.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Quick filters let you define additional filtering based on JQL. This is like creating a custom view for the board to include only the issues that you are interested in seeing for the time being. To create new quick filters, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Go to the Kanban board you want to add quick filters to.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Board drop-down menu and select the Configure option.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select Quick Filters from the left-hand navigation menu.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Enter a name and description for the new quick filter.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Enter the JQL query for the filter. Jira Software will help you construct and validate the query.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">Â </p>
<ol start="6" class="calibre14">
<li value="6" class="calibre9">Click on the Add button to create the new quick filter:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone46" src="img/00050.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the preceding screenshot, we have three quick filters already created, and we are creating a new one named Exclude Duplicated with the JQL query of <kbd class="calibre12">resolutionnotin(Duplicate)</kbd>Â to remove all issues with the value of Duplicate in the resolution field from the board.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have created the new quick filters, they will be displayed above the issue cards, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone47" src="img/00051.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Releasing a version in Kanban</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">With Kanban, tasks are not assigned to a predefined or planned release schedule, which is different to Scrum, where releases usually happen at the end of a sprint. When using Kanban, releases are made at the team's discretion as more and more tasks are being completed. The idea here is to continuously release new features and improvements as and when it makes sense for the team.</p>
<p class="calibre3">For example, some teams may choose to release on a regular basis, such as every Friday. Other teams may choose to release only when they have completed something useful.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To release a version from your Kanban board, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Release... link at the top right-hand corner of your board.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Enter the version number from the Release dialog.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select the release date.</li>
<li value="4" class="calibre9">Enter a short description for the version.</li>
<li value="5" class="calibre9">Click on the Release button to release the version, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone48" src="img/00052.jpeg"/></div>
<p>You must have the Administer Projects permission for all projects included in the board in order to release the version. We will cover permissions in <a href="part0091.html#2MP360-afcd22ce7063477f98fa024bc0dcef11" class="calibre21">Chapter 5</a>, <em class="calibre22">Customizing Jira Software</em>.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Once you have released a version, all the issues in the last column will have the version number added to their Fix Versions field, and will be taken off the Kanban board.</p>
<p class="calibre3">One thing to note about versions when working in Kanban is that you should not create the version you want to release ahead of time.</p>
<p class="calibre3">It is important to note that with Kanban, the release plan is to be continuously optimized. There is no point in releasing something simply because of a rule that states a release needs to be made on a Friday, when there are not many completed tasks. The team needs to look at their current lead time and then make the decision as to whether or not it makes sense to make a release.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Improving your team's performance</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">One common question that often pops up when teams are starting with Kanban is, <em class="calibre2">what is the correct limit I should set for each of my workflow statuses?</em>Â The answer is simple: try and experiment.</p>
<p class="calibre3">The first step is to look at your board and see if any constraints are being violated. If we take a look at the following example of a Kanban board, we can see that too many issues are in the In Progress column, and at the same time, we don't have enough issues in the QA column. What this tells us is that we have a bottleneck in our development phase of the workflow. This results in work being piled up in development while the QA engineers are waiting around and not being productive:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone49" src="img/00053.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">So in order to address this, as a team you will need to take a close look at the bottleneckâ€”in this case, the In Progress columnâ€”and figure out why this is happening. For example, perhaps you do not have enough developers to handle the workload and people are multitasking in order to try to complete as much work as possible. This will often cause unnecessary context switching, which in turn causes inefficiency, or perhaps the tasks are too complicated and need to be broken down.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Defining the column constraint can be an art, and once you have set the constraints, you will need to periodically review them and refine them as the project and team changes. When setting column constraints, keep the following points in mind about the limits you choose:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Limit set too high</strong>: You will have idle tasks sitting around, and this will lead to bad lead/cycle time.</li>
<li class="calibre9"><strong class="calibre1">Limit set too low</strong>: You will have idle people waiting for work, and this will lead to bad productivity.</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">Remember, with Kanban, you and your team should continuously improve your process; the board helps you to highlight any potential bottlenecks, so you and your team can improve your processes.</p>
<p>Do not just fix the boardâ€”fix the cause of the bottleneck.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Improving the process with charts and reports</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">Jira Software comes with a number of useful charts and reports to help you visualize your team's performance and identify potential bottlenecks in your Kanban process. To generate a report, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Browse to the Kanban board you want to generate a report on.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Click on the Reports tab from the left-hand panel of your board.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the following screenshot, there are a number of reports that are available. The reports under the Agile section are specifically designed for using agile methodologies, such as Kanban. Of course, the other reports, such as Pie Chart Report, are also very useful, but since these are vanilla Jira reports, we will be focusing mainly on the agile reports, namely Cumulative Flow Diagram and Control Chart:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone50" src="img/00054.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Since Kanban is a continuous process, you should run these reports regularly.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Cumulative flow diagram</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The first useful chart Jira Software provides is the cumulative flow diagram. This chart shows you the number of issues (<em class="calibre2">y</em> axis) in various statuses, displayed as colored bands, over a period of time (<em class="calibre2">x</em> axis). This way, you will be able to visually identify whether there are any bottlenecks in a particular status in your team's workflow, as you will see a widening in the colored band representing the status.</p>
<p class="calibre3">To generate the cumulative flow diagram for your Kanban board, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Reports tab from the left-hand panel of your board.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the Cumulative Flow Diagram option:</li>
</ol>
<div><img class="alignnone51" src="img/00055.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">In the preceding sample chart, we can see there is a sudden surge for the In Progress status (represented as the purple band) toward the end of the month, around November 29. This indicates that there is a bottleneck, with issues getting stuck in the In Progress status, and it is worth investigating what is causing this.</p>
<p class="calibre3">With the cumulative flow diagram, you can hover over the diagram and see what issues are being moved into the various statuses so that you can get a clearer picture of what is happening. If your diagram gets a bit busy, you can refine it by selectively hiding statuses (columns), swimlanes, and issues (via quick filters) to display only the data you are interested in, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone52" src="img/00056.jpeg"/></div>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Control chart</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The second useful chart to help you measure your team's performance is the control chart. The control chart shows you the average lead time of your team over a period of time, and plots the issues on the chart so you can see the following:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Any issues that are outside of the standard deviation, also known as outliers</li>
<li class="calibre9">The average time taken to complete tasks</li>
<li class="calibre9">The team's rolling average and how it compares to the average</li>
</ul>
<p class="calibre3">To generate the control chart for your Kanban board, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Click on the Reports tab from the left-hand panel of your board.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Select the Control Chart option.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">As shown in the following screenshot, the control chart shows:</p>
<ul class="calibre8">
<li class="calibre9">Issues on the board represented by green dots. A hollow green dot represents a single issue and a solid green dot (bigger) represents multiple issues. You can click on these dots to see the issue details.</li>
<li class="calibre9">The time period is shown as dates on the <em class="calibre2">x</em> axis.</li>
<li class="calibre9">The time it takes for issues to be completed on the <em class="calibre2">y</em> axis.</li>
<li class="calibre9">The average duration for issue completions, shown as the red line.</li>
<li class="calibre9">The average lead time for issues, shown as the blue line. A downward trending blue line indicates improvements in efficiency.</li>
<li class="calibre9">The standard deviation, shown as a light-blue band:</li>
</ul>
<div><img class="alignnone53" src="img/00057.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">Generally, you would want to have the blue line trending downwards; this would indicate a decrease in the average lead time. This means that issues are not stuck in workflow statuses and are being completed quickly, and that your team is not overbooked.</p>
<p class="calibre3">You would also want to have a low standard deviation. This is an indication of how each issue is measured against the rolling average (blue line). The narrower the blue band, the closer each issue is being delivered to the average time. This means that it's more likely the team will be able to deliver work at the same rate.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title" id="calibre_pb_0">Customizing the control chart</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p class="calibre3">The control chart has several customization options that allow you to fine tune the data being displayed on the chart. These options are displayed below the chart itself, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<div><img class="alignnone54" src="img/00058.jpeg"/></div>
<p class="calibre3">When you first start working with the control chart, you should want to identify and remove the outliers from the chart as they can often skew your data and give you incorrect readings.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Outliers are the green dots far above the light-blue band; these are often issues that are created or transitioned incorrectly because of human error. You can easily filter out these issues by applying a label to each of the issues and creating a new quick filter. To do this, perform the following steps:</p>
<ol class="calibre14">
<li value="1" class="calibre9">Review each outlying issue and apply a label (outlier) to it if it is confirmed to be an outlier.</li>
<li value="2" class="calibre9">Create a new quick filter for the board with the following JQL: <kbd class="calibre12">labelsnotin(outlier)</kbd>.</li>
<li value="3" class="calibre9">Select the new quick filter from the Quick Filters field on the control chart.</li>
</ol>
<p class="calibre3">You can use this technique to filter out other issues that might skew your chart, such as duplicated issues.</p>

<p class="calibre3">In this chapter, we looked at using Jira Software for Kanban. We have looked at the Kanban board and how to configure it to model your existing workflow, as well as setting up column constraints to limit the work in progress, which is the key concept with Kanban. We also looked at some of the charts that are available to help you identify potential bottlenecks in your process so that you and your team can work together to address those issues and improve your process.</p>
<p class="calibre3">Now that we have covered using Jira for both Scrum and Kanban, we will look at some of the unique additions Jira brings to these two agile methodologies, namely Scrumban and Kanplan, in the next chapter.</p>
