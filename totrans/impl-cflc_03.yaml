    Now, we will cover **pages**, **attachments**, and other core features of Confluence
    that will help you quickly navigate within your collaboration environment. We
    will concentrate on every part of the Confluence **New Editor** area in this chapter.
    We will discuss how to create and maintain dynamic content and present practical
    collaboration examples on Confluence. By the end of this chapter, we’ll be ready
    to create and organize content with Confluence.

    practically so that we can use this tool effectively. In this section, we’ll talk
    about many text-processing features from other software you might be familiar
    with. We want to underline an important point: Confluence is a collaboration tool
    with powerful text-processing features. However, its main feature is not text
    processing. For this reason, you may realize that many features available in text
    processors are not in Confluence. Being aware that these features may have been
    left out on purpose can significantly increase the efficiency we get from Confluence.
    We aim to work together; hundreds of fonts, colors, and very detailed formatting
    features can easily distract us from this goal, and we can get lost in the details.
    That’s why you’ll find only the most essential features in Confluence; this simplicity.
    Although you may find it strange, this will allow you to focus on the content,
    communication, and teamwork so that you have less of a problem when working on
    the content as a team.'

    be valid for long periods and, therefore, will be subject to regular updates,
    you should create it as a page. If the content you create will only be used actively
    for a certain period and will not receive any updates afterward, you can prepare
    it as a blog post. Using the page and blog post concepts intentionally will help
