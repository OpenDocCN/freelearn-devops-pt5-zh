  <div><h1 id="_idParaDest-5" class="Introduction-Title--PACKT-">Preface</h1>
    <p class="normal">This is a book about Git, the most popular version control system in the world. I will explain what version control is and then lead you from introductory topics to quite advanced material. See chapter 1 for what background experience and software you will need (all free).</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-6" class="title">Who this book is for</h1>
    <p class="normal">This book is for programmers of any skill level. Full Stop.</p>
    <p class="normal">Version control is essential to every programming project, as will be explained in chapter 1, and Git is the world's most popular version control system. The larger the team the more urgent it is that you use version control, but it can be essential for a single programmer as well.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-7" class="title">What this book covers</h1>
    <p class="normal"><em class="chapterRef">Chapter 1</em> is the <em class="italic">Introduction</em>; you will learn about how the book is structured, what Git is, what version control systems are, where Git came from, and what tools are available for Git. You will also learn how to install Git on your computer.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 2</em>, <em class="italic">Creating Your Repository</em>, you will learn how to create a repository and clone it from GitHub. You will see the relationship between the repository on your disk and the one you've created on GitHub. A simple example program will be introduced.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 3</em>, <em class="italic">Branching, Places, and GUIs</em>, we'll cover the work area, the index, the repository, the remote repository, and the stash; what they are; and what they are for.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italic">Merging, Pull Requests, and Handling Merge Conflicts</em>, you'll learn about branching: a central concept in version control and one of Git's great strengths. Branching allows you to work on more than one thing at a time and keeps your release code clean. Git has especially fast branching.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 5</em>, <em class="italic">Rebasing, Amend, and Cherry-Picking</em>, you'll learn how to re-write history with Rebase and Amend. The very term Rebase makes some programmers quiver with fear, but I'll show you how to master this useful (and safe!) tool.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 6</em>, <em class="italic">Interactive Rebasing</em>, we'll look at how you can change the message associated with your commit, rearrange multiple commits, and even drop commits before pushing them to the server.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 7</em>, <em class="italic">Workflow, Notes, and Tags</em>, we examine the basic workflow for managing your repository, as well as how to add metadata to keep your repository clean and clear.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 8</em>, <em class="italic">Aliases</em>, we'll examine aliases and how they can save you a lot of work. Aliases can combine commands and all their flags to make your life much easier.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 9</em>, <em class="italic">Using the Log</em>, we will look at the very powerful <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">log</code> command. Log is much overlooked, and yet it can give you insight into every aspect of your current and past status of your projects.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 10</em>, <em class="italic">Important Git Commands and Metadata</em>, we'll go on to examine some very useful and important Git commands. These powerful statements can get you out of trouble when things appear to have gone wrong.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 11</em>, <em class="italic">Finding a Broken Commit: Bisect and Blame</em>, we'll look at a life-saving command, <code class="Code-In-Text--PACKT-">Bisect</code>, which helps Git help you find where your program broke.</p>
    <p class="normal">In <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 12</em>, <em class="italic">Fixing Mistakes</em>, you'll learn how to get yourself out of difficulty if you make a mistake while using Git.</p>
    <p class="normal">Finally, in <em class="chapterRef">Chapter 13</em>, <em class="italic">Next Steps,</em> we'll take a quick look at additional resources.</p>
    <h1 id="_idParaDest-8" class="title">To get the most out of this book</h1>
    <ul>
      <li class="bullet">You will want to be somewhat comfortable with a programming language. Familiarity with C# is a big plus, but not required.</li>
      <li class="bullet">You will need Git (free) installed on your computer, and it would be best also to have the latest free version (or better) of Visual Studio 2019. Finally, you'll want to download and install (free) GitHub Desktop. Thus, you do not have to spend any money to follow the examples in this book.</li>
      <li class="bullet">A note to macOS users: All of the above applies to you as well, and I don't anticipate you having any additional issues.</li>
      <li class="bullet">A note to Linux users: I don't work with Unix, but I strongly suspect that all of the above (except Visual Studio) will apply to you as well.</li>
    </ul>
