<p class="mce-root">In this chapter, we will continue customizing Jira further while take a look at how we can add more fields to our project by using screens and making sure that those new fields are visible only on a specific type of issue. We will also take a look at various permissions and learn how to modify them.</p>
<p>Topics covered in this chapter include the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding new custom fields in Jira</li>
<li>Understanding Jira screens</li>
<li>Using the custom field in our project</li>
<li>Transition screens</li>
<li>Working with permissions</li>
</ul>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Adding new custom fields in Jira</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In the previous chapter, we created a custom workflow that we want to use with the Bug issue type. We learned how to map this new workflow to the Bug issue type. This is great because the life cycle of the bug will be different compared to other issue types in Jira. However, we want to customize our project further; we want to capture additional information from the user who is reporting a bug. The additional information will be nothing but a new field in Jira, better known as a Custom fields.</p>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>Two new fields are required in our project: Steps to reproduce and Type of Bug. The first field will be a text field where the user can enter text freely, but the second field will be a drop-down from where user needs to select an item. Let's now add these two fields to our instance.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps to add a custom field:</p>
<ol>
<li>In your Jira instance, go to Jira settings | Issues | Custom fields (under FIELDS)</li>
<li>Click on the Add custom field button in the top-right corner, demonstrated as follows:</li>
</ol>

<p>Figure 1</p>
<ol start="3">
<li class="mce-root">In the Select a Field Type popup, select Text Field (multi-line) and press the Next button, demonstrated as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/90cb93bf-7dc4-424a-858e-1745cd8e2d41.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 2</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>In the Configure Text Field (multi-line) Field pop up, enter the Name as <kbd>Steps to reproduce</kbd> and also add a meaningful Description. Finally, press the Create button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, a custom field will be created in your instance of Jira. You will be asked to add this newly created custom field to a screen, but ignore this and continue with the creation of the field.</p>
<p class="mce-root">Follow the same set of instructions to add the <kbd>Type of Bug</kbd> custom field but, in this instance, the field type should be Select List (single choice) where you need to also add some Options for the user to select from the drop-down list.</p>
<p>Now that we have two new fields with us, let's now learn how to use them in our project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Understanding Jira screens</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Screens are nothing but containers of fields in Jira. Screens can have many fields in any order of your choosing. The order of the fields can be changed by you as well. Whenever you interact with an issue in Jira, you are, in most cases, working with a screen. To understand the screen, we have to also understand the concept of an operation.</p>
<p>There are three types of operation in Jira. These are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create issue</li>
<li>Edit issue</li>
<li>View issue</li>
</ul>
<p>These operations are self-explanatory, but it is important to know here that the fields displayed on these operations can be different. When you create a new issue in Jira, you may just want to capture few fields, but when that issue is edited later, you may also want to capture more information. That is why these operations can have different screens associated with them.</p>
<p>In our case, we want the two new custom fields to be added in all three operations. In the next section, we will learn how to add the fields to our project.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Using the custom field in our project</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Once you have added new custom fields to your instance, those fields are available globally for you to use in your project. Until you add those fields to your project, the fields will not be usable.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps to add the fields to the Bug issue type:</p>
<ol>
<li>Inside your project, go to Project settings | Screens.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li>Under the Screens section, you will notice that there are two screen schemes already used in your project, as shown in the following screenshot. These two schemes are based on the template that we used earlier when we created the project:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/cf02a862-907e-4cc9-93c1-dd4026c591d4.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>As you can see, there is a separate screen scheme used by the Bug issue type. Under this scheme, there is just one screen, called SSP: Scrum Bug Screen (1), that is used by all three operations; in other words, Create issue, Edit issue and View issue.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>To add our new fields, click on the screen SSP: Scrum Bug Screen (1) and, in the Configure Screen section, go to the bottom of the page were all the existing fields are listed, click on the Select Field ... drop-down, and select the two new fields that we added earlier, demonstrated as follows:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/cede239f-f54c-4596-b736-2a1ab9abe738.png" style="width:20.17em;height:21.08em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 4</p>
<p>The fields will then be added to your project, but will only be available with the Bug issue type, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/5715ef16-2c6e-4c10-81b2-ee230a91b901.png" style="width:37.50em;height:37.17em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 5</p>
<p>You can also create your own screen scheme to map different screens to various operations because perhaps you don't want to capture a field during issue creation, but want to capture it later, when the issue is edited.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Transition screens</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>Apart from the screens used here, there is also the option to capture input from the user during workflow transitions, and this is done using transition screens. </p>
<p>What if we want the user to fill in a field called Analysis when the bug is resolved, but we do not want this field to be captured when we create a bug. In this case, we could create a new screen for the bug edit operation, but that would mean the user needs to click on the Edit button on the issue to enter information in this field. This requirement can be achieved by using a completely new screen and using that screen when the bug is resolved or, in our case, sent to Done status.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps to create a new screen and use it as a transition screen:</p>
<ol>
<li>Firstly, create a new custom field as we did earlier in this chapter and name that field Analysis.</li>
<li>Now, go to Jira settings | Issues | Screens (under SCREENS) and click on the Add screen button in the top-right corner. In the Add screen popup, enter the Name as <kbd>Analysis screen</kbd> and a meaningful Description, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/aa09a966-d05d-4381-8454-f03e130d21b8.png" style="width:28.33em;height:18.08em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 6</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Then, in the Configure screen section, add the Analysis field that you just created onto this screen.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now, we need to use this screen containing just a single field in our Bug workflow. Go to Project | Project settings | Workflows and click on the pencil sign next to Bug workflow to edit it, as shown here:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/56c3049d-6f6b-4e7d-bea3-dd081c3b6cb6.png" style="width:43.83em;height:20.42em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 7</p>
<ol start="5">
<li>Now, inside your Done transition, click on the Edit button, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/5c2c1718-bc1d-4c25-a66a-79254aeaa083.png" style="width:29.83em;height:19.75em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 8</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Then, in the Edit Transition popup, select Screen as Analysis screen and press the Save button, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/ec04abf4-9eb9-482c-856e-062b43d9ca77.png" style="width:27.42em;height:24.42em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 9</p>
<p>We are almost done now. After modifying the workflow, you also need to publish it, since this workflow was already attached to a project and used actively, hence, it needs to be published again. There will be a button at the top called Publish Draft. Press it to finally apply your changes to the project.</p>
<p>To test your new transition screen, go to any bug issue that you want to resolve by moving it to the Done state, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/970296f8-7e2b-45ad-85a5-9981de95fde7.png" style="width:39.33em;height:24.83em;"/></p>
<p>Figure 10</p>
<p>You will notice that a new screen will pop up, asking you to enter an analysis and a comment before finally changing the status of the bug to Done.</p>


            

            
        
    

        

                            
                    <h1 class="header-title">Working with permissions</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>We have implemented a significant number of customizations in our project. Now, let's take a look at one more configuration that will let you control who can do what in your project. Jira can be used by a small team comprising a few people to thousands of users in an enterprise and, with many people accessing a single instance, you may be worried about controlling your project permissions.</p>
<p>When you created the project earlier using a template, Jira created a number of default configurations and schemes, such as the issue type scheme, the workflow scheme, the issue type screen scheme, the permission scheme, and the notification scheme.</p>
<p>You can also create your own scheme with your own customized configurations. However, we can also use the configurations suggested by the template and later tweak them slightly. Let's now change the permissions for our project to hide it from everyone except people who have been added to our project by the project administrator.</p>
<p>In Jira, there is a concept of project role, which is nothing but a team of people or users per project. For example, there is a role called Developers in our instance where we can add more people. Now, what those people would do in that role depends really on the permissions defined in our permission scheme.</p>
<p>Perform the following steps to restrict access to our project to just a developer role:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, we need to create a new permission scheme, so go to Jira settings | Issues | Permission schemes (under ISSUE ATTRIBUTES) and click on the Copy link under Actions for Default Permission Scheme.</li>
<li>Once the Default Permission Scheme is copied, then click on its Edit link under Actions and rename it to something else, such as Software Permission Scheme. </li>
<li>Now, we have a new permission scheme that we can modify. Click on the Permissions link of the new permission scheme and you will see lot of permissions related to project, comments, and who can do what, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/d9487fda-d2d2-4b8f-9f38-701f44418e39.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 11</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>The second column, Granted to, has a list of either the individual user, group, or project role who have that permission.</li>
<li>To restrict access to a project, remove everything from the Browse Projects permission and only give it to Project role developers, as shown in the following screenshot:</li>
</ol>
<p class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="img/550f6de0-e23e-4c20-92e7-550b12ee75d2.png"/></p>
<p>Figure 12</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Now we have a new permission scheme that we can use in our project. In our project, go to Project settings | Permissions | Actions | Use a different scheme.</li>
<li>Now, select the Scheme that you just created and press the Associate button.</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations! You have modified the permission scheme of your project and now, only people added to the Developers role in the project will have access to it.</p>
<p>Knowing how to perform these customizations will empower you to take control of your Jira instance and make it work for you the way you want. Jira out-of-the-box will come with a number of templates that you can always tweak further if you know the proper way to customize your instance.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Summary</h1>
                
            
            
                
<p>In this chapter, we spent some time understanding how to add more custom fields from the users and also used them in our project by working on the screen. We also learned what transition screens are, and how they are different from normal screens. Finally, we modified the permissions of our project and restricted access to our project to a limited set of users. Although we only modified a single permission, knowing the right way to modify it is very important.</p>
<p>In the next chapter, we will look at the reporting capabilities of Jira. It is very important to know how to analyze the information that is already collected in our instance. Understanding how to track our progress using various reports and dashboards is a must-have skill that every Jira user and administrator ought to know.</p>
