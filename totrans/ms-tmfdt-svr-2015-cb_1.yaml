- en: Microsoft Visual Studio Team Foundation Server provides a set of integrated
    tools enabling Teams to effectively manage the life cycle of their software project.
    The Team in Team Foundation Server is encapsulated within the container of a Team
    Project. Simply put, **Team Project** is a logical container isolating all tools
    and artifacts associated with a software application together in a single namespace.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The conceptual boundary introduced through Team Project eliminates the problem
    of having access to unrelated artifacts such as code, Work Items, or release information
    not relevant to your applications development. Related Team Projects can be grouped
    together into a Team Project Collection. It can be used to introduce a physical
    separation between the groups of related Team Projects by hosting them in separate
    databases.

    which can internally host multiple Team Projects. Resources such as build pools
    are scoped at the Team Project Collection level. A Team Project can host multiple
    Teams; certain resources are set at the Team Project level and others at the Team
    level. As illustrated in the following screenshot, the selection of a source control
    repository (TFVC or Git) is made at the Team Project level; however, Teams have
    autonomy on the level of backlogs they choose and the workflows on the Kanban
    board. The delivery framework of choice is applied through the Process Template;
    this in turn applies the delivery framework-specific terminology, artifacts, and
    workflows to the Team Project and all Teams within the Team Project:'

- en: The Team Portal home page was traditionally used to pin charts, Work Item counts,
    and build status tiles to provide an at-a-glance view of the project to the Team
    members and stakeholders. The approach did not work well because the home page
    had hard-coded tiles that you were forced to have on the page. In addition, the
    page did not support grouping of the tiles or adding commentary to complement
    the visuals in the tiles. In TFS 2015 Update 1, the home page has been replaced
    by a new feature called **Dashboards**. The new feature comes with a library of
    widgets that can be used to create multiple Dashboards for your Team. In this

    internally with Team members and externally with stakeholders. Widgets are rendered
    as tiles in the Dashboard, the tiles use the TFS REST API to retrieve information
    from TFS. The information is loaded into the tiles using the template provided
    by the widget. The tiles can be moved around on the Dashboard and scaled to different
    sizes. The tiles support interactivity, for example clicking the **Query** tile
    would take you straight into the **Work Item Query** window. The tiles don't support
    cross-tile interaction yet. While it's possible to create multiple Dashboards,
    it is currently not possible to apply permissions for access to individual Dashboards.
    It is expected that in the long term more widgets will be added to the widget
    gallery and the API's will be made available to extend and create new widgets.

    Studio User Voice website with over 6,000 votes. TFS 2015 now allows you to rename
    a Team Project. While the product has made it very simple to rename a Team Project,
