Infrastructure and automation play key roles for enabling continuous deployment. In this lesson, we will learn about configuration automation and the implementation of infrastructure automation (Infrastructure as Code) with tools such as Chef and Ansible. We will also discuss the continuous monitoring process with the tools, Splunk and Nagios:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Continuous deployment</li><li class="listitem">Chef<div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist1"><li class="listitem">Components</li><li class="listitem">Terminology</li><li class="listitem">Architecture</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Ansible<div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist1"><li class="listitem">Components</li><li class="listitem">Terminology</li><li class="listitem">Architecture</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Continuous Monitoring</li><li class="listitem">Splunk</li><li class="listitem">Nagios</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">As we have discussed in the previous lessons, the following figure shows the process of continuous integration, continuous deployment, and continuous delivery alignment.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00078.jpeg" alt="DevOps Continuous Deployment" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p><p class="calibre8">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Continuous Integration</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">CI</strong></span>) is the process of making the development, unit test and build process on a continuous mode as opposed to staggered (step-by-step) methodology. In the CI process, every developer merges their code changes to a central version control system, each commit triggers automated build. So the latest versions are always available in the code repository and also built executable is from latest code.</p><p class="calibre8">
<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Continuous Delivery</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">CD</strong></span>) is a next step to the continuous integration process for software engineering to produce software in short cycles of testing, and releasing software faster and more frequently. The automated testing process ensures that the software can be reliably released at any time.</p><p class="calibre8">Continuous deployment is the process to minimize lead time (the elapsed time) between the development of new code and its availability in production for usage. To accomplish this, continuous deployment relies on infrastructure that automates various steps, after each successful code integration meeting the release criteria, leading to deployment, the live application is updated with new code.</p><p class="calibre8">Traditionally, a new machine is built by administrators and system engineers from documentation and customized scripts, and so on. Managing Infrastructure through manual procedures such as custom scripts, golden image configurations, and so on, are both time consuming and error-prone. Organizations looking for faster and matured deployments and concepts adopt infrastructure configuration automation, which means managing Infrastructure like a software code for reproducible results, hence it's also termed as <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">Infrastructure as Code</strong></span>.</p><p class="calibre8">Just like the SDLC process, infrastructure can be managed with similar tools and processes such as version control, continuous integration, code review, and automated testing extended to make configuration changes for infrastructure robust and automated. </p><p class="calibre8">The infrastructure code and configuration changes are consistently tested, shared, and promoted across all the environments from development to QA test systems and to- production more easily, rapidly, safely, and reliably with the detailed audit trail of changes. With infrastructure code as a service, the configuration of the new machines to the desired state can be written as a code to set up multiple machines at the same time. This scalable model is more effective by leveraging the elasticity of the cloud. Adopting DevOps to Infrastructure as Code str, and so on goes beyond simple infrastructure automation to extend multiple benefits as below:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Ensure error-free automation scripts are repeatable</li><li class="listitem">To be redeployed on multiple servers</li><li class="listitem">Ability to roll back in case of issues</li><li class="listitem">Infrastructure code testing standards such as unit testing, functional testing, and integration testing can be effectively enforced</li><li class="listitem">Since the documented state of the machine is maintained as code and made up-to-date, written documentation is avoided</li><li class="listitem">Enable collaboration between dev and ops around infrastructure configuration and provisioning, infrastructure code as change management<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00079.jpeg" alt="DevOps Continuous Deployment" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre14"> </p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">We will discuss continuous deployment from the perspective of popular tool features and functionality listed in the preceding figure.</p></div>

<div class="book" title="Chef"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h1 class="title" id="calibre_pb_1"><a id="ch04lvl1sec29" class="calibre1"/>Chef</h1></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Chef is one of the prominent configuration management and infrastructure automation platforms; it provides a full suite of enterprise capabilities such as workflow, visibility, and compliance. It enables continuous deployments for both infrastructure and applications from development to production. Infrastructure configuration automation as code is written, tested, deployed, and managed by Chef across networks such as the cloud, on-premises, or hybrid environments with comprehensive 24 x 7 support services. Examples are client systems, security patches can be updated from master server by writing configurations as a set of instructions and executed on multiple nodes simultaneously.</p><p class="calibre8">The Chef platform as shown in the following figure, supports multiple environments such as Amazon Web Services, Azure, VMware, OpenStack, Google Cloud, and so on. Platforms such as Windows, Linux, VMware, and so on, are available. All the popular continuous integration tools such as Bitbucket, Jenkins, GitHub, CircleCI, and so on, are supported for workflow integration. The runtime environment is available on Kubernetes, Docker, and Swarm.</p></div></div>

We will discuss each of the components, the terminology, and the role it plays in the ecosystem to enable a Chef client to execute the job assigned. Chef terminology resembles food preparation. Cookbooks are the formula to make food dishes and recipes are ingredients.</p><p class="calibre8">The components of Chef are:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Chef server</li><li class="listitem">Chef client</li><li class="listitem">Chef workstation</li><li class="listitem">Chef repo</li></ul></div><div class="book" title="Chef Server"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch04lvl3sec17" class="calibre1"/>Chef Server</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">The Chef server is the hub for maintaining the configuration data across the network, storing cookbooks, applying policies to nodes, and each registered node detailed metadata managed by the Chef client. Chef server provides configuration details, such as recipes, templates, and file distributions through the Chef client installed on the respective nodes. Accordingly, the Chef clients implement the configuration on their nodes relieving the Chef server of any processing tasks. This model is scalable to consistently apply the configuration throughout the organization.</p></div><div class="book" title="Features of Chef Server"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch04lvl3sec18" class="calibre1"/>Features of Chef Server</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Web-enabled user interface with management console and search.</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Management console on the chef server is a web-based interface for managing multiple functions such as:<div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist1"><li class="listitem">Nodes in the network</li><li class="listitem">Cookbooks and recipes</li><li class="listitem">Roles assigned</li><li class="listitem">Data bags--JSON data stores, might include encrypted data</li><li class="listitem">Environment details</li><li class="listitem">Search facility for indexed data</li><li class="listitem">Administrative user accounts and data for chef server access</li></ul></div></li><li class="listitem">Search functionality facilitates querying any types of data indexed on Chef server such as nodes, roles, platforms, environments, data bags, and so on. The Apache Solr search engine is the base search engine and extends all the features such as pattern search with exact, wildcard, range, and fuzzy. A full indexed search can be run with different options within the recipe, command line, management console search feature, and so on.</li><li class="listitem">Data bags are located in a secure sub-area on the Chef server; they store sensitive data such as passwords, user account data, and other confidential types of data. They can only be accessed by nodes with the authentic SSL certificates validated by the Chef server. A data bag is accessed by the Chef server with its global variables stored in JSON format. It can be searched and accessed by recipe and loaded.</li><li class="listitem">A policy defines how roles, environments, and cookbook versions are to be implemented in the business and operational requirements, processes, and production workflows:<div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist1"><li class="listitem">A role is a way to assign the tasks based on specific functions, patterns, and processes performed in an organization such as power or business user, and so on. Each node, web, or database server consists of unique attributes and a run list is assigned per role. When a node is to perform a task, it compares its attributes list with those required to execute the function. The Chef client ensures the attributes and run lists are up-to-date with those on the server.</li><li class="listitem">Environments reflect organizations real-life requirements such as development, staging, or production systems, each are maintained with a cookbook version.</li><li class="listitem">Cookbooks maintain organization-specific configuration policies. Different cookbook versions are maintained such as source control with associated environments, metadata, run lists for different needs; they are uploaded on to a Chef server and applied by a Chef client while configuring the nodes.

Chef client configures each node in the organization through cookbooks and recipes, the fundamental unit of configuration is the cookbook and provides structure to your recipes. Infrastructure state is defined as a file, a template, or a package in policy distribution as per the required scenario.</p><p class="calibre8">The programming language for Chef cookbooks is Ruby as a full-fledged programming language with syntax definitions. Recipes are simple patterns for specific configuration items such as packages, files, services, templates, and users with blocks that define properties and values that map to them. Recipes are the fundamental configuration element in a cookbook. A Chef recipe is a file that groups related resources, such as everything needed to configure a web server, database server, or a load balancer.

It provides the following rich features:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Access control is role-based to keep the environment secure, and efficient in managing – allows sharing of SSH credentials but not transfer</li><li class="listitem">With push-button deployment access even non-privileged users can safely deploy entire applications by providing access on the fly</li><li class="listitem">Ensuring complete auditability and compliance as all Ansible automations are centrally logged</li><li class="listitem">Inventory with a wide variety of cloud sources, can be graphically managed or synced</li><li class="listitem">It's based on a robust REST API, integrates well with LDAP, and logs all jobs</li><li class="listitem">Easy integration with the continuous integration tool Jenkins, command-line tools options are available</li><li class="listitem">Supports auto scaling topologies though provisioning callback</li><li class="listitem">Ansible Tower is installed using Ansible playbooks<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00087.jpeg" alt="Ansible Terminology, Key Concepts, Workflow, and Usage" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre14"> </p></li></ul></div><div class="book" title="CMDB"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch04lvl3sec25" class="calibre1"/>CMDB</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Ansible <span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">configuration management database</strong></span> (<span class="strong"><strong class="calibre2">CMDB</strong></span>) maintains the entire configuration information of the enterprise in the database and supports cloud creation options in multiple formats for different vendors.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00088.jpeg" alt="CMDB" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div><div class="book" title="Playbooks"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch04lvl3sec26" class="calibre1"/>Playbooks</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Playbooks are the configuration programs written in YAML to automate the systems. Ansible can finely orchestrate multiple instances of infrastructure topology with very detailed control over many machines at the same time. Ansible's approach to orchestration is finely-tuned automation code managed through simple YAML on syntax or features.</p><p class="calibre8">Ansible playbooks describe a policy to be orchestrated for enforcement on remote systems for configuration and deployment to enforce general IT process adherence steps.</p><p class="calibre8">A simple analogy is, an inventory of hosts is raw material, instruction manuals are playbooks, and Ansible modules are the tools in the workshop.</p><p class="calibre8">To manage configurations of deployments to remote machines, playbooks can be used at a basic level. They can sequence multi-tier rollouts involving rolling updates on a more advanced level, to interact with monitoring servers and load balancers along the way and delegate actions to other hosts.</p><p class="calibre8">Playbooks are developed in a basic text language conveniently designed to be human-readable. Organizing playbooks and the files can be done in multiple ways.</p><p class="calibre8">A simple playbook example:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting">- hosts: webservers 
serial: 6 # update 6 machines at a time 
roles: 
- common 
- webapp 
- hosts: content_servers

These resource modules are pushed by Ansible on nodes to configure them to the desired state of the system. These Ansible modules are executed over SSH (Secured Shell) on the target nodes and removed after accomplishing the task. The module library is shipped by default with a number of modules to be executed through playbooks or directly on remote hosts. The modules can reside on any machine, there is no concept of servers, daemons, or databases to maintain them. The modules and libraries are customizable, typically created with any terminal program, a text editor, and to keep track of changes to the content, the version control system is used effectively.</p><div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00090.jpeg" alt="Modules" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre11"> </p></div><div class="book" title="Inventory"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch04lvl3sec28" class="calibre1"/>Inventory</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Ansible inventory is a list of resources:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Hosts and groups</li><li class="listitem">Host variables</li><li class="listitem">Group variables</li><li class="listitem">Groups of groups and group variables</li><li class="listitem">Default groups</li><li class="listitem">Splitting out group and host and specific data</li><li class="listitem">List of inventory behavioral Parameters</li><li class="listitem">Non-SSH connection types</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">Ansible, through the inventory list, works on multiple systems in the infrastructure simultaneously. The dynamic inventory mechanism allows multiple inventory files to be flexible and customizable at the same time through inventory plugins. The inventory list can be in a default location or specify inventory file location of your choice from dynamic or cloud sources, EC2, Rackspace, OpenStack, or different formats.</p><p class="calibre8">Here's what a plain text inventory file looks like:</p><div class="informalexample"><pre class="programlisting"> [webservers]

Plugins can connect to any data source, extend the connection types for transport other than with SSH, call back for logs, and even add new server-side behaviors.</p></div><div class="book" title="Ansible Tower"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch04lvl3sec30" class="calibre1"/>Ansible Tower</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Offers multiple features such as:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">LDAP, AD, SAML, and other directories can be connected</li><li class="listitem">Access control engines that are role based</li><li class="listitem">Credentials without exposure storage</li><li class="listitem">Simple for first time users</li><li class="listitem">Smart Search enabled information lookup</li><li class="listitem">Configure automation at runtime</li><li class="listitem">REST API based integration with processes and tools</li><li class="listitem">Tower clusters to extend capacity</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">Ansible Tower can invoke multi-playbook workflows to link any number of playbooks, with different inventories, run as different users, run as batch, or with different credentials.</p><p class="calibre8">Ansible Tower workflows facilitate many complex operations, build workflows to provision the machines, apply base configurations of systems, and deploy the applications by different teams maintaining different playbooks. A workflow can be built for CI/CD to build an application, deploy to a test environment, run tests, and based on test results, automatically promotes the application. Ansible Tower's intuitive workflow editor easily models complex processes with different playbooks set up to run as alternatives in case of success or failure of a prior workflow playbook.</p><p class="calibre8">A typical workflow may be as follows, it can be effectively used on multiple systems quickly without taking their infrastructure offline. To achieve continuous deployment, automated QA is vital to mature to this level:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Script automation to deploy local development VMs</li><li class="listitem">CI system such as Jenkins to deploy to a staging environment on every code change</li><li class="listitem">The deploy job executes the test scripts on build for pass/fail for every deploy</li><li class="listitem">Upon success of the deploy job, the same playbook is run against production inventory</li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">The Ansible Tower workflow brings the following features and functionality:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Jobs schedule</li><li class="listitem">Built-in notifications to inform the teams</li><li class="listitem">Stabilized API to connect to existing tooling and processes</li><li class="listitem">New workflows to model entire processes<div class="mediaobject"><img src="../images/00092.jpeg" alt="Ansible Tower" class="calibre10"/></div><p class="calibre14"> </p></li></ul></div><p class="calibre8">The Ansible Tower dashboard (refer to the image) offers functionality as listed:</p><div class="book"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">Dashboard and real-time automation updates</li><li class="listitem">Graphical inventory management</li><li class="listitem">Integrated RBAC with credential management</li></ul></div></div><div class="book" title="Ansible Vault"><div class="book"><div class="book"><div class="book"><h3 class="title2"><a id="ch04lvl3sec31" class="calibre1"/>Ansible Vault</h3></div></div></div><p class="calibre8">Ansible Vault is a feature to keep sensitive data in encrypted form, for example passwords or keys as opposed to saving them as plain text in roles or playbooks. These vault files can be placed in source control or distributed to multiple locations.

It facilitates embed testing directly in Ansible playbooks through a push-based mechanism.</p><p class="calibre8">Ansible playbooks are models of desired-state of the system that will ensure the things declared, such as services to be started and packages installed, are in accordance with declarative statements. Ansible is an order-based system on unhandled errors. A host will fail immediately and prevent further configuration of that host and shows them as a summary at the end of the Ansible run. Ansible is a multi-tier orchestration system to incorporate tests into the playbook run, either as tasks or roles.</p><p class="calibre8">Testing the application for integrating tests of infrastructure before deployment in the workflow will be effective to check the code quality and performance before it moves to production systems. Being push-based, the checks and balances in the workflow and even upgrading is very easy to maintain on the localhost or test servers.</p></div></div>

Some of the metrics are sprint scope changes, bugs count of field and fixed, and the ratio of promised-to-delivered features. These metrics are the drivers on team effectiveness and adherence to the schedule, this monitoring is built-in as an Agile plugin for issue tracking.</p><p class="calibre8">Code Vulnerabilities: Monitoring vulnerabilities in application code, lists the weaknesses induced in the top-level code by insecure coding practices. These can be addressed by conducting regular code reviews or changing third-party dependencies, and so on.</p><p class="calibre8">Deployments: Deployment monitoring is configuring your build servers to have some monitoring built into the process to notify the team. Notification-capable continuous integration servers communicate with chat servers and promptly alert teams of failed builds and deployments.</p><p class="calibre8">Application log output: Application log output to be planned for centralized logging if services are distributed to gain full benefit, errors and exceptions provides value in real-time. The ability to trace notifications from error-producing code in a searchable format generates benefit, before production move.</p><p class="calibre8">Server Health: Monitoring of uptime and performance of available resources downed or over-utilized servers fall in this category. Intrusion detection and health monitoring systems being on the same notification pipeline will provide additional value.</p><p class="calibre8">Activity Monitoring: User activity monitoring is both feature development and the scaling of infrastructure. Along with monitoring development milestones volume of data is monitored.</p><p class="calibre8">The centralized storage of consolidated logging data for application logs, user activity monitoring, and project history enhances the value to detect and analyze in a global context correlating different log sources about the state of the application and the project.</p></div>
