                    Mock Exam Questions and Final Notes
                
            
            
                
<p>This chapter presents some final notes with some mock questions. We will look at a brief summary of the exam specification, how it is delivered to you, and what topics are more relevant than others.</p>
<p>The mock questions prepared for this book are similar to the ones you will get during the exam. Please read them carefully because some are multiple-choice. Multiple-choice questions will appear in the exam and you should know how to answer them.</p>
<p>By the end of these questions, you will have a good idea of the format of the exam, what kind of questions you will get, and what topics are more relevant than others.</p>
<h1 id="uuid-02094cad-07f6-493b-a801-f48261fa3da5">Docker Certified Associate exam details</h1>
<p>At the time of writing this book, the exam is based on the Docker Enterprise platform. Please refer to Docker's site, <a href="https://success.docker.com/certification">https://success.docker.com/certification</a>, to obtain the latest information.</p>
<p>The Docker Certified Associate exam will validate your Docker Enterprise professional skills and usually requires a minimum of 6 to 12 months of platform experience. This book teaches these required skills with labs that help you understand the platform's concepts and usage.</p>
<p>You can pay for and take this exam online, but it is only available in English. Although the Docker site shows that results will be delivered immediately, sometimes results can take 24â€“48 hours to be delivered.</p>

<p>The exam consists of 55 questions and the topics covered in this book have different values. We recommend you use the Docker Enterprise platform's 30-day free-trial, as there will be many exam questions about Docker Enterprise components and management. It is also recommended that you have good knowledge of Docker's command-line actions and options, including how to obtain and filter information about Docker resources. These are the topic weights at the time of writing this book:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Orchestration</strong>: 25%</li>
<li><strong>Image creation, management, and registry</strong>: 20%</li>
<li><strong>Installation and configuration</strong>: 15%</li>
<li><strong>Networking</strong>: 15%</li>
<li><strong>Security</strong>: 15%</li>
<li><strong>Storage and volumes</strong>: 10%</li>
</ul>
<p>This gives you an idea of each topic's importance and the question distribution. In the next section, we will provide some questions to help you prepare for the exam. They are exam-like questions. Take care because many of them have more than one correct answer and you should choose all the right ones. The answers to all these questions can be found at the end of this book, in the <em>Assessments</em> section.</p>

<h1 id="uuid-942c5913-36de-4d6d-99d8-e43d7c909b96">Summary</h1>
<p>This was the final chapter on our journey to becoming a Docker Certified Associate. We covered all the topics learned in previous chapters with some mock exam questions. As mentioned before, some of these questions are real questions posed in old exams.</p>
<p>The journey to becoming a Docker Certified Associate is not easy. We started this book from the very beginning, understanding why containers are so popular these days when we talk about microservices architectures. Then, we described how containers are executed using Docker Engine, integrating various isolation strategies to ensure security between container-embedded processes. As containers are based on images, we learned how to build and maintain them using Docker tools. We learned about different Docker objects and how to deploy applications using different networking methods, volumes, or security approaches. We learned how to deploy microservices applications, where every component is running containers. We learned the differences between running all components on standalone and cluster-wide distributed environments. Orchestrators are key in distributed environments. They keep applications healthy and help us develop microservices faster to provide features to update applications' components without service interruption. We studied Docker Swarm and Kubernetes because both are part of the Docker Enterprise platform. Finally, we introduced Docker's enterprise-ready CaaS platform, Docker Enterprise. We learned about all its components and features and how they help us to deploy applications, as well as improving their security.</p>
<p>This was a brief summary of all the topics covered in this book. If you followed this workflow, you are ready to take the Docker Certified Associate exam. This book should also be used as a command reference, although we know that technology changes quite fast these days. Now that you are ready to take the exam, take a deep breath and schedule your exam at <a href="https://prod.examity.com/docker">https://prod.examity.com/docker</a>. Good luck!</p>
