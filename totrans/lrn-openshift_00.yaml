- en: OpenShift is an application management platform that leverages Docker as an
    isolated runtime for running applications and Kubernetes for container orchestration.
    First introduced on May 4, 2011, it drew heavily from Borg— a container orchestration
    solution developed by Google engineers for managing hundreds of thousands of containers. In
    September 2014, it was redesigned, with Docker and Kubernetes becoming its main
    building blocks, and, since then, it has seen a large number of improvements and
    a growing community of users and developers. At the time of writing, the most
    recent version of OpenShift is 3.9, which became generally available on March
    28, 2018, with 3.10 under development. Release 3.9 was the next one after 3.7,
    so technically, it incorporates changes intended for 3.8 as well, and represents
    a significant step in its life cycle.

- en: Relying on Docker, OpenShift brings the true power of containerization to businesses,
    allowing them to respond quickly to ever-increasing demand from customers, and
    to maintain a good reputation by supporting high-availability and multi-data center
    deployments out of the box. From a business perspective, OpenShift reduces the
    costs associated with your investment by 531% over five years, with average annual
    benefits of $1.29 million and a packback period of 8 months of payback period—more
    details can be found at [https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4305976/s3-files/idc-business-value-of-openshift-snapshot.pdf](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4305976/s3-files/idc-business-value-of-openshift-snapshot.pdf).

- en: Developers will find OpenShift's self-service portal easy to use, providing
    quick access to all features and deployment strategies, supporting unmodified
    source code, as well as Docker images and Dockerfiles, allowing developers to
    concentrate on development instead of managing their environment. OpenShift can
    automate every aspect of your release management by relying on Jenkins pipelines
    and integration with SCM.

- en: For operations, OpenShift provides automatic failover and recovery, as well
    as high-availability and scalability, meaning that operations teams can spend
    their time on more high-level tasks. It can also be integrated with various SDN
    technologies developed by vendors other that Red Hat. And the fact that it relies
    on well-known technologies makes the learning curve shallow.

- en: From a security standpoint, OpenShift can be integrated with corporate identity
    management solutions for user management and role assignment. It can expose applications
    to corporate security infrastructure for granular access control and auditing,
    protect sensitive data used by your applications, and manage access between different
    applications.

- en: Examples in this book are demonstrated on OpenShift Origin 3.9, but all of them
    are applicable to Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform^(TM) as well due to their
    technical equivalence. The book is built in modular fashion, so if you feel that
    you are already familiar with certain topics, feel free to move on to another
    chapter.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is written for professionals who are new to OpenShift, but it also
    covers some advanced topics as well, such as CI/CD pipelines, high availability,
    and multi-data center setups. Readers do not require any background in Docker,
    Kubernetes, or OpenShift, although familiarity with the basic concepts will be
    beneficial. The book doesn't cover how to work with Linux though, so at least
    a year of previous experience with Linux is expected. The primary goal of this
    book is not so much about theoretical knowledge, as it is about hands-on experience,
    which is why we use a practical approach with virtual labs where possible. The
    book starts by introducing readers to the concept and benefits of containers in
    general, in order to get newcomers up to speed quickly, and then builds on that
    foundation to guide readers through the basic and advanced concepts of Kubernetes
    and OpenShift. The book finishes by providing readers with an architectural reference
    for a highly available multi-data center setup. Before we started working on this
    book, we realized that there is very little information available on how to deploy
    OpenShift in multiple data centers for high availability and fault tolerance.
    Due in no small part to that, we decided to pool our experience and collaborate
    on writing this book.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This books assumes that you have practical experience with Linux and open source,
    are comfortable working with a command-line interface (CLI), are familiar with
    text editors such as nano or vi/vim, and know how to use SSH to access running
    machines. Since OpenShift can only be installed on RHEL-derived Linux distributions,
    previous experience of RHEL/CentOS 7 is preferable, as opposed to Debian-based
    variants. Knowing about cloud technologies and containers will certainly be a
    plus, but is not required.

- en: To ensure the smoothest experience, we recommend using a laptop or desktop with
    an adequate amount of RAM, as this is the most critical resource for OpenShift.
    You can see all requirements for your learning environment in the *Software Hardware
    List* section that is included in the GitHub repository. Using a system with less
    than 8 GB RAM may result in occasional failures during the installation of OpenShift
    and overall instability, which will be distracting, even though it will boost
    your troubleshooting skills.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important aspect concerns the DNS of your environment. Some network
    providers, such as Cox ([https://www.cox.com](https://www.cox.com)), redirect
    requests for all non-existent domains (those that result in an NXDOMAIN response
    from upstream DNS) to a custom web page with partner search results. Normally,
    that is not a problem, but during the installation of OpenShift, it will manifest
    itself by failing the installation. This happens because local DNS lookup settings
    for your virtual machine and containers managed by OpenShift include several domains
    to contact in order before NXDOMAIN is returned to the client making the request,
    and the next one is tried only after the previous one has returned NXDOMAIN. So,
    when your provider intercepts such requests, it may return its own IP, which will
    result in the OpenShift installer trying to reach a certain service at that IP
    for a health check. As expected, the request will not be answered and the installation
    will fail. For Cox, this feature is called *Enhanced Error Results*, so we suggest
    you opt out of it on your account.
