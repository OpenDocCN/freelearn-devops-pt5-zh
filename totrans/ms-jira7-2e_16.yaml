- en: There are a lot of different tools and applications required at various stages
    of the **software development life cycle** (**SDLC**). JIRA and Confluence act
    as one of the most important tools, but several other applications, such as Bamboo,
    Fisheye/Crucible, and other tools, are also used for different purposes to assist
    development. One of the best features of JIRA is its ability to integrate with
    a variety of tools from Atlassian and other third-party companies. Let's take
    a look at some of the common integrations you can perform with JIRA.

- en: In this chapter, you learned how JIRA can be integrated with other common tools
    used in software development processes. Integration with version control software
    enables developers to associate the code file with the JIRA ticket. Most other
    tools from Atlassian can also be integrated into JIRA by either installing an
    add-on or by configuring application links. In the next chapter, we will discuss
    best practices that need to be employed to use JIRA effectively, especially in
    enterprise installations with thousands of users and multiple customizations.
    These best practices and standardized procedures will help administrators to maintain
    and support JIRA for a long time.
