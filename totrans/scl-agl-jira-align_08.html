			<h1 id="_idParaDest-94"><em class="italic"><a id="_idTextAnchor096"/>Chapter 6</em>: Program Execution Challenges</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we will continue the discussion of program-level agile with a focus on execution. Planning and execution go hand in hand. Indeed, as we saw in the previous chapter, key planning tools such as roadmaps and the program board are living documents that support ongoing execution since they are connected to the actual work items being delivered. This chapter rounds out the previous one, providing essential tools for scaling agile team execution to the program. Program-level execution is so important for business agility that the <strong class="bold">Scaled Agile Framework</strong> (<strong class="bold">SAFe</strong>) calls it <strong class="bold">Essential</strong> in <strong class="bold">SAFe 5.0</strong>. In other words, you are not following <strong class="bold">SAFe</strong> if you are not delivering at the team of teams level.</p>
			<p>In this chapter, we will cover the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Overseeing the program room</li>
				<li>Negotiating and visualizing dependencies</li>
				<li>Reducing waste, managing scope, and communicating progress</li>
			</ul>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-95"><a id="_idTextAnchor097"/>Overseeing the program room</h1>
			<p>Jira Align <a id="_idIndexMarker284"/>provides a dashboard for teams at each level of scale called a <strong class="bold">room</strong>. The dashboard for program teams is the Program Room. It's a one-stop-shop for all things related to program-level execution. Here, the Release Train Engineer (RTE), scrum masters, and other <a id="_idIndexMarker285"/>program members have a bird's-eye view of what's happening in the program increment. To access it, select your program and PI in the configuration bar, then go to the navigation menu and select <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Program Room</strong>.</p>
			<p>The program room is highly configurable, but there are two data sections that always display sprints and work items. These are shown in the middle of the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.1_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.1 – Jira Align program room&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.1 – Jira Align program room</p>
			<p>The <strong class="bold">Sprints</strong> section displays the <a id="_idIndexMarker286"/>following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Each sprint in the PI has a green bar indicating the completion percentage based on accepted story points. Hover over the bar to see the numerical percentage. Stories must be assigned to the sprint to be included, but don't need to be accepted within the sprint.</li>
				<li>The diamond icon indicates a release vehicle ship date. Hover over the diamond to see the name of the release vehicle and the completion percentage.</li>
				<li>The star icon indicates milestone and objective target completion dates. Hover over the star to see the name of the objective or milestone.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The work items list displays the following information:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>All features, capabilities, and portfolio epics assigned to the selected program and PI.</li>
				<li>You can select the <strong class="bold">Feature view</strong>, <strong class="bold">Feature by Portfolio Epic</strong> view, or, if capabilities are enabled, the <strong class="bold">Feature by Capability</strong> view. Do this by clicking on the header of the work items list.</li>
				<li>Note that the data for portfolio epics reflects the portion pertaining to the selected PI.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker287"/>program room is configurable with over a dozen widgets that can be toggled on by clicking on the <strong class="bold">View Configuration</strong> button at the top of the workspace to the right of the center. Widgets can be repositioned in the room by clicking and dragging them. In the previous screenshot, we toggled on the progress, program increment load, team progress, and team load versus capacity widgets and positioned them to the left of the sprints and work items sections. We toggled on the actions, dependencies, and impediments widgets and positioned them to the right.</p>
			<p>The following are descriptions of the various widgets:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Progress</strong>: Displays the time left for the PI; the percentage of objectives completed; the number and percentage of accepted stories versus total stories; the percentage of accepted portfolio epics, capabilities, features, and stories; and the number of dependencies completed out of the total number of dependencies.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Actions</strong>: Displays open and closed meeting action items for the selected program and PI.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Chat</strong>: Provides an area for chat and discussions on any work item in the PI.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dependencies</strong>: Displays dependencies where the selected program is a <strong class="bold">Requesting</strong> or <strong class="bold">Depends On</strong> program, dependencies between the program teams, and dependencies associated with the PI or that have a <strong class="bold">Needed By</strong> date within the PI.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Impediments</strong>: Displays team impediments.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Objectives</strong>: Displays PI objectives.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Program Increment Load</strong>: Displays the program's average velocity over the previous two PIs, which you can manually change by clicking on <strong class="bold">Override</strong>, and the PI load, which by default is the estimated load based on total feature points. You can click on the gear icon to select the actual load based on total story points.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Release Vehicle</strong>: Displays release vehicles with work items assigned to the PI (even if the release vehicle dates are outside of the PI) and to the program.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Risks</strong>: Displays risks for the selected program that are assigned to the selected PI.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team Load vs Capacity</strong>: Displays the load versus capacity percentage for each team in the program, based on the total team story points loaded in the PI divided by the team's PI capacity. The PI capacity is the sum of the velocities of each sprint in the program increment. Click on a row to open the team's details panel for more information, including current and past sprints and the average team velocity <a id="_idIndexMarker288"/>over the previous five sprints.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Program Increment Planning Checklist</strong>: Provides a configurable list of steps to complete before starting the PI.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Team Progress</strong>: Displays the total story points accepted by the team within the PI as a percentage of the team's PI velocity. The team's PI velocity is their average velocity multiplied by the number of sprints in the PI.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Runway</strong>: Displays the runway for portfolio epics, capabilities, features, and stories, which allows you to compare the amount of time needed to complete the work you haven't started with a goal you set. Click on the gear icon to enter the runway goal, which is measured in sprints for stories and months for features, capabilities, and portfolio epics, and the percentage deviation, which signifies how close you'd like to be to the goal.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>You now know the key data sections and widgets of the program room, and they are only a portion of what the program room offers. Here are some other highlights:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Key Metrics</strong> button at the top of the workspace to see the PI burndown/burnup, group velocity, velocity by certainty, velocity by complexity, and PI defect trend.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">Run a Meeting</strong> button to launch backlog refinement and scrum of scrums meetings. RTEs can start and stop PIs by clicking on the button in the top-right corner of the workspace.</li>
				<li>Click on the <strong class="bold">View Program Board</strong> button to open that centerpiece of the program, which we<a id="_idIndexMarker289"/> covered in the previous chapter.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Now that you've been introduced to the program room, let's return to the all-important topic of dependencies.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-96"><a id="_idTextAnchor098"/>Negotiating and visualizing dependencies</h1>
			<p>In the last chapter, we<a id="_idIndexMarker290"/> learned how to view, customize, and share <a id="_idIndexMarker291"/>information from the dependency grid. We'll now examine Jira Align's sophisticated dependency workflow. After that, we'll learn how to handle external dependencies. Lastly, we'll explore the various dependency visualizations beyond the basic grid view.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-97"><a id="_idTextAnchor099"/>Dependency workflow</h2>
			<p>Jira Align's dependency <a id="_idIndexMarker292"/>functionality enforces a contract between teams supported by a collaborative workflow. The first step in the workflow is to create a dependency. To do so, click on the <strong class="bold">Add Dependency</strong> button in the top-right corner of the dependency grid workspace to open the <strong class="bold">New Dependency</strong> details panel, shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.2_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.2 – Jira Align create a new dependency&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.2 – Jira Align create a new dependency</p>
			<p>Here, you can enter and <a id="_idIndexMarker293"/>track the following details for a dependency:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Title</strong>: Add a meaningful title for the dependency.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: Add further descriptive details about the dependency.</li>
				<li><code>PI-5</code>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">What is this Dependency for?</strong>: Select the dependent work item (feature, capability, or portfolio epic). For example, select <strong class="bold">Feature</strong> and then associate a feature as the dependent work item. A dependent work item is one that depends on another team or program's work item.</li>
				<li><code>Baltimore</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Cowboys</code>.</li>
				<li><code>Sprint 25</code>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button. The <a id="_idIndexMarker294"/>dependency status will be set to <strong class="bold">NOT COMMITTED</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.3_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.3 – Jira Align dependency not committed&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.3 – Jira Align dependency not committed</p>
			<p>The team on the receiving end of the request – in this case, <code>Cowboys</code> – should respond by selecting a <code>Sprint 24</code>. If the respondent commits by or earlier than the <strong class="bold">Needed By</strong> sprint – for example, <strong class="bold">Sprint 25</strong> – then it will set the status to <strong class="bold">COMMITTED</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.4_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.4 – Jira Align dependency committed"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.4 – Jira Align dependency committed</p>
			<p>If the respondent chooses to <a id="_idIndexMarker295"/>commit to a later sprint – for example, by selecting <code>Sprint 26</code> as the <code>Baltimore</code> – to consider. This is shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.5_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.5 – Jira Align new dependency proposal"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.5 – Jira Align new dependency proposal</p>
			<p>If the requester now<a id="_idIndexMarker296"/> clicks on the <strong class="bold">Accept</strong> button, this would set the dependency status to <strong class="bold">COMMITTED</strong> and update the <strong class="bold">Needed By</strong> sprint to match the new <strong class="bold">Committed By</strong> sprint. If the requester clicks on the <strong class="bold">Decline</strong> button, then the status would be set to <strong class="bold">NOT COMMITTED</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.6_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.6 – Jira Align dependency proposal declined"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.6 – Jira Align dependency proposal declined</p>
			<p class="callout-heading">Tips and tricks</p>
			<p class="callout">It is important that the requester communicates with the respondent to negotiate a mutually agreeable commitment date. We recommend directly speaking with the other team to negotiate a suitable commitment date before formalizing the agreement in Jira Align.</p>
			<p>Now that the<a id="_idIndexMarker297"/> requester has declined the new proposal, it's the respondent's turn to act. At this point, the respondent can indicate that their team is blocked by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Block</strong> button and providing a blocked reason, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.7_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.7 – Jira Align dependency blocked"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.7 – Jira Align dependency blocked</p>
			<p>Alternatively, the <a id="_idIndexMarker298"/>respondent can click on the <strong class="bold">Request New</strong> button and select a <strong class="bold">Committed By</strong> sprint on or before the <strong class="bold">Needed By</strong> sprint to set the dependency to <strong class="bold">COMMITTED</strong> status. If this does not occur, it could take several volleys back and forth before both sides agree on a <strong class="bold">Committed By</strong> sprint. All of this activity can be viewed by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Audit Log</strong> link at the top right of the details panel. Clicking on the <strong class="bold">Subscribe</strong> link will notify you of changes to the dependency. Note that by default, the <strong class="bold">Product Owner</strong> (<strong class="bold">PO</strong>) and scrum master of the involved teams are automatically notified.</p>
			<p>As work progresses, either the requester or the respondent can indicate that they are blocked at any time by setting the first or second field in the following screenshot to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong> and entering a blocked reason. This will set the dependency status to <strong class="bold">Blocked</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.8_B16328.jpg" alt=""/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.8 – Jira Align dependency work status</p>
			<p>Once work is <a id="_idIndexMarker299"/>done, or if it turns out that no work is required to meet the needs of the dependent team, the third or fourth field in the previous screenshot can be set to <strong class="bold">Yes</strong>, which will update the status of the dependency to <strong class="bold">DONE</strong>, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.9_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.9 – Jira Align dependency with no work required&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.9 – Jira Align dependency with no work required</p>
			<p>Note that aside<a id="_idIndexMarker300"/> from updating the <strong class="bold">Work is Done</strong> field (see <em class="italic">Figure 6.8</em>), it is best practice for the responding team to associate their work item – that is, the work item needed by the requesting team – with the dependency. This is done near the bottom of the dependency details panel. That way, the real-time status of the work item can be easily gathered when viewing the dependency details.</p>
			<p>There are other actions you can take by clicking on the <strong class="bold">More Actions</strong> button at the top of the dependency details panel, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Delete</strong>: Remove a dependency by deleting it.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Reject</strong>: Cancel a dependency and mark it as <strong class="bold">REJECTED</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Duplicate</strong>: Clone a dependency to serve as the basis for a similar one.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Uncommit</strong>: Move a dependency status back to <strong class="bold">NOT COMMITTED</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These options vary<a id="_idIndexMarker301"/> depending on the status of the dependency and your role permissions. Note that when a dependency is set to either <strong class="bold">No Work Required</strong> or <strong class="bold">Rejected</strong>, it will require <strong class="bold">No Work / Rejected Reason</strong> to be filled out, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.10_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.10 – Jira Align dependency rejected&#13;&#10;"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.10 – Jira Align dependency rejected</p>
			<p>Now that we've explored the dependency workflow, let's take a look at how to create external dependencies.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-98"><a id="_idTextAnchor100"/>External dependencies</h2>
			<p>It is a common challenge for<a id="_idIndexMarker302"/> teams to track external factors that affect their delivery. In Jira Align, external dependencies are not enabled by default. The Jira Align administrator can enable them by going to <strong class="bold">Administration</strong> | <strong class="bold">Settings</strong> | <strong class="bold">Platform</strong> and clicking on <strong class="bold">Manage Dependencies</strong> in the <strong class="bold">Team</strong> tab. This will open the window shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.11_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.11 – Jira Align Manage Dependency Combinations window"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.11 – Jira Align Manage Dependency Combinations window</p>
			<p>Note the toggles shown for external dependencies at the feature, capability, and portfolio epic levels. The administrator can slide these on to enable external dependencies at those levels and then click on the <strong class="bold">Save Settings</strong> button to apply the changes.</p>
			<p>Now that external dependencies are enabled, let's add external entities by going to <code>Publishing House</code> and we assign an internal owner who will be responsible for communications with the external entity:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.12_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.12 – Jira Align external dependency entity creation"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.12 – Jira Align external dependency entity creation</p>
			<p>Now, when you<a id="_idIndexMarker303"/> close the window and create an external dependency, you will see the entities you added in the <strong class="bold">External</strong> dropdown list near the bottom of the following screenshot, in the <strong class="bold">Depends On</strong> section:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.13_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.13 – Jira Align create an external dependency"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.13 – Jira Align create an external dependency</p>
			<p>Here, we are creating an external dependency in <code>PI-5</code> for team <code>Baltimore</code>, which depends on the <code>Publishing House</code> external entity to complete work by <code>30/10/2020</code>.</p>
			<p>Now that we've<a id="_idIndexMarker304"/> explored the dependency workflow, including external dependencies, let's explore the various dependency visualizations.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-99"><a id="_idTextAnchor101"/>Dependency maps</h2>
			<p>Jira Align calls its <a id="_idIndexMarker305"/>many helpful visualizations <strong class="bold">dependency maps</strong>. To access them, let's return to the dependency grid by going to the navigation menu and selecting <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Dependencies</strong>. Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Maps</strong> button near the top right of the workspace to access the visualizations:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.14_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.14 – Jira Align dependency maps"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.14 – Jira Align dependency maps</p>
			<p>The options<a id="_idIndexMarker306"/> shown allow you to track, take action, and report on dependencies. Let's begin with the <strong class="bold">Team Status</strong> option.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-100"><a id="_idTextAnchor102"/>Team status dependency map</h2>
			<p>This option allows you to <a id="_idIndexMarker307"/>view dependencies by team and prioritize them as needed. Be sure to set your team and PI context in the configuration bar. In the following screenshot, we have selected the <code>Baltimore</code> team and <code>PI-5</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.15_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.15 – Jira Align team status dependency map"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.15 – Jira Align team status dependency map</p>
			<p>The arrows on the<a id="_idIndexMarker308"/> dependency map indicate the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Right arrows</strong>: Indicate outbound dependencies that the current team needs to deliver to another team.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Down arrows</strong>: Indicate inbound dependencies that the current team needs from another team.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The color codes are shown in the report legend, which you can access by clicking on the color wheel button at the top right of the workspace. The dependencies are color-coded as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Green</strong>: Committed/delivered</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Orange</strong>: Not committed/not delivered</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Blue</strong>: Rejected or no work required</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Red</strong>: Blocked</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Note that the dependencies<a id="_idIndexMarker309"/> are prioritized using the rank number and then ordered by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Save</strong> button at the bottom of the list. Click on the <strong class="bold">Quick Filters</strong> button to toggle on/off dependencies based on association (inbound or outbound) and status. Lastly, you can export a snapshot view of the dependency map by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Capture</strong> button. Let's now explore the <strong class="bold">Incremental Status</strong> option.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-101"><a id="_idTextAnchor103"/>Incremental status dependency map</h2>
			<p>This option allows you to view <a id="_idIndexMarker310"/>dependencies by program to help coordinate the required work effort. As shown in the following screenshot, you can set the configuration bar context to include one or more programs with a program increment. Note that this is enabled by the best practice of programs within a portfolio sharing a common PI cadence:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.16_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.16 – Jira Align program increment status dependency map"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.16 – Jira Align program increment status dependency map</p>
			<p>Here, we've selected the <code>AI</code>, <code>Blockchain</code>, and <code>Mobile</code> programs and <code>PI-5</code> as our context. Note the <strong class="bold">Dependency Level</strong> dropdown, where we've chosen to display <strong class="bold">Team</strong> dependencies. As with the previously discussed dependency map, statuses are color-coded to allow quick identification of dependencies that require attention and action. The color codes are shown in the report legend, which you can access by clicking on the color wheel button at the top right of the workspace. Additionally, you can click on the <strong class="bold">Extra Configs</strong> button<a id="_idIndexMarker311"/> to toggle on/off the dependencies based on status and/or target delivery sprint. You can export a snapshot view of the dependency map by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Capture</strong> button. Let's move on now to the <strong class="bold">Grid View</strong> option.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-102"><a id="_idTextAnchor104"/>Grid view dependency map</h2>
			<p>This option displays the count <a id="_idIndexMarker312"/>of dependencies between teams and programs in the form of a matrix. The configuration bar context is set to include a program with a program increment. In the following screenshot, we've set the <strong class="bold">Dependency Level</strong> dropdown to <strong class="bold">Program</strong> to see a program dependency matrix:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.17_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.17 – Jira Align grid view dependency map"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.17 – Jira Align grid view dependency map</p>
			<p>Note the toggle selections at the top right where you can choose to show unassociated teams/programs and dependencies that are delivered and committed. Click on the <strong class="bold">Extra Configs</strong> button to filter dependencies based on type – for example, team/program dependencies, multiple team/program dependencies, capability external dependencies, and external dependencies.</p>
			<p>Next, click on any number in the grid to open a details panel on the right. For example, in the following <a id="_idIndexMarker313"/>screenshot, we've clicked on <code>5</code> in the <code>Baltimore</code> row to see the five dependencies that <code>Baltimore</code> needs from the <code>Cowboys</code> team:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.18_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.18 – Jira Align grid view dependency map details report"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.18 – Jira Align grid view dependency map details report</p>
			<p>Note that dependencies are displayed with the dependent work item and that statuses are color-coded according to the report legend. You can export a snapshot view of the dependency map by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Capture</strong> button. We're now ready to explore the popular <strong class="bold">Wheel View</strong> option.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-103"><a id="_idTextAnchor105"/>Wheel view dependency map</h2>
			<p>This option allows you to view<a id="_idIndexMarker314"/> dependencies as lines or strings between teams/programs. Green lines indicate delivered dependencies, blue ones indicate not delivered, and red ones indicate blocked or uncommitted dependencies. The configuration bar context is set to include a program with a program increment. Clicking on a team or a program on the wheel opens a details panel on the right. For example, in the following screenshot, we've clicked on <strong class="bold">Cowboys</strong> to see the dependencies they need from others and that others need from them:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.19_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.19 – Jira Align wheel view dependency map"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.19 – Jira Align wheel view dependency map</p>
			<p>Statuses are color-coded <a id="_idIndexMarker315"/>the same way as strings, and you can click on the color wheel icon in the top right for the color key. Note the toggle selections above the wheel, where you can show dependencies related to work items (features, capabilities, and portfolio epics), only associated dependencies, and inactive dependencies. You can further expand the work items to show specific levels of dependencies, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.20_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.20 – Jira Align wheel view dependency map options"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.20 – Jira Align wheel view dependency map options</p>
			<p>Here, we see that for dependencies associated with features, you can slide toggles on to display the team, program, and external dependencies. You can also toggle on the option to show items within or <a id="_idIndexMarker316"/>outside the program. For dependencies associated with portfolio epics and capabilities, you can slide on toggles to display program and external dependencies.</p>
			<p>Lastly, you can export a snapshot view of the dependency map by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Capture</strong> button. We're now ready to explore the <strong class="bold">Analytics View</strong>.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-104"><a id="_idTextAnchor106"/>Analytics view dependency map</h2>
			<p>This view allows you to <a id="_idIndexMarker317"/>analyze dependency clusters by showing which teams and programs have the highest quantity of dependencies. This way, you can find out where to focus your dependency reduction efforts. The configuration bar context is set to include a program with a program increment. You can set the <strong class="bold">Dependency Level</strong> dropdown to <strong class="bold">Team</strong> in order to see the team dependency trend, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.21_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.21 – Jira Align analytics view dependency map"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.21 – Jira Align analytics view dependency map</p>
			<p>The <a id="_idIndexMarker318"/>dependencies are grouped in the following way:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cluster by team/program</strong> as a percentage of the team/program with the most dependencies.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cluster by team/program</strong> as a percentage of all dependencies.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Count by team/program</strong> for the PI.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Managing and reducing dependencies is critical for effective execution. Now that we've explored how to create, track, and visualize dependencies, let's examine how Jira Align can help with other key concerns of the program.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-105"><a id="_idTextAnchor107"/>Reducing waste, managing scope, and communicating progress</h1>
			<p>In this closing section, we will explore how to get a handle on a program's scope of work<a id="_idIndexMarker319"/> for the PI, reduce duplicate work, and effectively communicate delivery status. We will begin with the popular <strong class="bold">Work Tree</strong> view, which has helped numerous organizations address these challenges. We'll then examine two reports, program increment progress and scope change, functionality for splitting features, and finally, the PI and release vehicle roadmaps. Together, these tools help ensure effective program-level execution.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-106"><a id="_idTextAnchor108"/>Work tree</h2>
			<p>In the last chapter, we saw the<a id="_idIndexMarker320"/> benefits of real-time work status updates in the work view roadmap and program board. Another important visualization for real-time information is the work tree, which has the added benefit of showing how work items connect to one another from top to bottom and bottom-up. It is an important tool for analyzing work across the organization with an eye toward reducing work per <em class="italic">Principle 10</em> of the <em class="italic">Agile Manifesto</em>: <em class="italic">Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential.</em> As a case in point, we've seen $750,000 in savings due to the avoidance of duplicate work for a single program ART in a single PI. Cost savings of this magnitude could not have been possible without full enterprise-wide visibility into all work happening across the organization.</p>
			<p>To begin, go to the navigation menu and select <code>Mobile</code> program and <code>PI-5</code> program increment in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.22_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.22 – Jira Align work tree"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.22 – Jira Align work tree</p>
			<p>Next, click <a id="_idIndexMarker321"/>on the <strong class="bold">Extra Configs</strong> button in the top-right corner of the workspace to access the view dropdown list, as shown in the following screenshot. Here, we focus on two views: <strong class="bold">Top-Down View from Portfolio Epic</strong> and <strong class="bold">Bottom-Up View from Story</strong>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.23_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.23 – Jira Align the work tree extra configs"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.23 – Jira Align the work tree extra configs</p>
			<p>For a broader-reaching <a id="_idIndexMarker322"/>view that could potentially help identify larger duplicate work items, choose the top-down view. It starts with portfolio epics associated with the selected PI, and then traces downward, including all child and grandchild work items that are attached to the epic, including those that fall outside the PI. This view shows fewer orphan stories and more of the larger-size work items.</p>
			<p>If you are looking to identify more orphan stories with less attention to larger items, choose the bottom-up view. It starts with all stories associated with the selected PI and traces upward to the portfolio epics. It shows more orphan stories and fewer of the larger-size work items than the top-down view.</p>
			<p>To limit the work items shown to only the selected PI, slide on the <strong class="bold">Narrow Filter Report</strong> toggle under <strong class="bold">Extra Configs</strong>. Note that the <strong class="bold">Team View</strong> option in the view dropdown is the same as the bottom-up view except that it allows you to filter the work tree for your team only. This is a good option for scrum masters and product owners.</p>
			<p>Now that we've learned techniques for analyzing the interconnected work across the organization, let's explore two key reports for tracking the work of a PI as it progresses.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-107"><a id="_idTextAnchor109"/>Program increment progress</h2>
			<p>The program increment progress report<a id="_idIndexMarker323"/> provides an understanding of whether the work for the selected PI is on track. It presents both burndown and burnup charts for features and stories. Burndown charts are useful for portfolio managers and RTEs to predict when all work of the PI will be completed. They display remaining work in story points on the vertical axis versus time on the horizontal axis. Burnup charts provide insight into the teams' ability to deliver features and stories as planned. They display completed work and the total amount of work in story points on the vertical axis versus time on the horizontal axis.</p>
			<p>To access the report, go to the navigation menu and select <code>Mobile</code> program and <code>PI-5</code> program increment in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.24_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.24 – Jira Align program increment progress report"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.24 – Jira Align program increment progress report</p>
			<p>Note the<a id="_idIndexMarker324"/> since <code>PI-5</code> is not yet finished, there are three projected lines continuing from the orange accepted line on the burndown charts at the top of the workspace. These predict the normal, optimistic, and pessimistic trends for acceptance of the PI's remaining work based on the current acceptance rate.</p>
			<p>Click on the <strong class="bold">Burn Details</strong> button at the top right of the workspace to open a panel with the predicted daily burn rate and underlying team velocities used in the calculation, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.25_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.25 – Jira Align program increment progress report burn details"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.25 – Jira Align program increment progress report burn details</p>
			<p>Note that scrum masters and product owners can easily filter the report for their teams by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Extra Configs</strong> button at the top right of the workspace and selecting their name from the dropdown list.</p>
			<p>There are also <a id="_idIndexMarker325"/>various options for drilling down into data by clicking on the <strong class="bold">Drill Down</strong> button located near the top of the workspace to the right of center. Here, you can view the charts by programs or themes and then drill down to see the programs' teams or the themes' portfolio epics. In the following screenshot, we have drilled down to view the burndown charts for the teams in the program:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.26_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.26 – Jira Align program increment progress report by teams"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.26 – Jira Align program increment progress report by teams</p>
			<p>Lastly, note that <a id="_idIndexMarker326"/>any chart can be displayed in full screen or downloaded by clicking on the three bars at the top of the chart to the right of the title. Now that we've seen how scrum masters, RTEs, and others can monitor and predict work delivery, let's see how they can identify and review any scope changes impacting the selected PI.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-108"><a id="_idTextAnchor110"/>Scope change</h2>
			<p>This report visualizes features <a id="_idIndexMarker327"/>that are added or removed during a PI and is useful for portfolio managers and RTEs to understand scope changes. To access the report, go to the navigation menu, click on the search icon (magnifying glass), and then search for <code>Program Increments Scope</code>. Be sure to set your context in the configuration bar. In the following screenshot, we have selected the <code>Mobile</code> program and the <code>PI-5</code> program increment:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.27_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.27 – Jira Align scope change report"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.27 – Jira Align scope change report</p>
			<p>The first section of the report is a line graph showing how the scope changed in terms of total story points on the vertical axis and PI date markers on the horizontal axis. Ideally, all scope should be added at the start of a PI. A slightly upward trend on the line graph or statistics is normal. However, a downward trend indicates that teams overcommitted and had to remove story points from the PI.</p>
			<p>The next section shows a roll-up of scope change statistics for the PI, and the last section provides a list of features, broken down as follows: in scope at the start of the PI, added to the PI after it <a id="_idIndexMarker328"/>started, and removed from the PI after it started. The dates that features were added or removed are shown, along with their current state. This allows product managers and RTEs to evaluate the trade-offs made during the PI as inputs for continuous learning and better planning for future PIs.</p>
			<p>Now that we've seen how to monitor scope changes during the PI, let's examine how RTEs can ensure that the PI is ready to be closed by using a PI cleanup report.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-109"><a id="_idTextAnchor111"/>PI cleanup</h2>
			<p>The program increment cleanup is a<a id="_idIndexMarker329"/> comprehensive audit report showing all items due for completion in the selected PI that have not yet been closed, accepted, or delivered. It is useful for program leaders and RTEs to run the report toward the end of a PI, or even after a PI completes, to see what items are outstanding.</p>
			<p>To access the report, go to the navigation menu, click on the search icon (magnifying glass), and then search for <code>Program Increments Cleanup Report</code>. Be sure to set your context in the configuration bar. In the following screenshot, we've selected the <code>Mobile</code> program and the <code>PI-5</code> program increment:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.28_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.28 – Jira Align program increment cleanup"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.28 – Jira Align program increment cleanup</p>
			<p>Here, you can click on any item's ID to open its details panel on the right. The report displays data in a series of scrolling sections, as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Objective Not Completed</strong>: All objectives due in the PI that are not yet completed</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Risks That Are Open</strong>: All risks that are not yet closed in the PI</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Impediments That Are Open</strong>: All impediments that are not yet closed in the PI</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stories Not Accepted</strong>: All stories due in the PI that are not yet accepted</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Features Not Accepted</strong>: All features due in the PI that are not yet accepted</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Open Action Items</strong>: All action items that are not yet closed in the PI</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Portfolio Epics Not Accepted</strong>: All portfolio epics due in the PI that are not yet accepted</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dependencies Not Delivered</strong>: All dependencies due in the PI that are not yet delivered</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stand-alone Features With No Epics Assigned</strong>: All features due in the PI that are orphans and don't have a parent portfolio epic</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Stories With No Features Assigned</strong>: All stories due in the PI that are orphans and don't have a parent feature</li>
			</ul>
			<p>An overall scan of the <a id="_idIndexMarker330"/>report will quickly provide a feel for the health of the PI for the selected program. It's especially useful to review the report toward the end of the PI so that outstanding items can be addressed before the PI is closed. In some cases, items may need to be moved to either the next PI or unassigned backlog, or split, a function we will explore next.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-110"><a id="_idTextAnchor112"/>Handling unfinished work</h2>
			<p>Now that we've seen <a id="_idIndexMarker331"/>how the PI cleanup report brings attention to the program's unfinished work, we'll learn how best to handle it. Just as it's best practice for teams to split unfinished stories at the end of a sprint for a more accurate velocity metric, programs split unfinished features at the end of the PI. This practice ensures a more accurate program velocity and carries forward only the unfinished portion of the work.</p>
			<p>Jira Align makes it easy to split unfinished features. Simply click on the feature in the backlog, program board, or elsewhere to open its details panel. Next, click on the <strong class="bold">Split</strong> link on the right, seven positions down from the <strong class="bold">View in JIRA</strong> button. This will open the window shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.29_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.29 – Jira Align splitting a feature"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.29 – Jira Align splitting a feature</p>
			<p>Note that Jira <a id="_idIndexMarker332"/>Align adds a suggested <code>(Split Part 2)</code> suffix to the original feature name, which you can modify. Next, select a future PI or the unassigned backlog to which the new feature, along with the unaccepted stories from the original feature, will be moved. Lastly, click on the <strong class="bold">Split</strong> button to execute the feature split.</p>
			<p>Once split, the original feature will display a link to the new feature, as shown in the following screenshot:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.30_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.30 – Jira Align split feature link"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.30 – Jira Align split feature link</p>
			<p>Note that the <a id="_idIndexMarker333"/>original feature is identified as the parent and the new split feature as the child. You can click on the link to open the child from the parent and vice versa.</p>
			<p>Now that we've seen some ways to better monitor scope and delivery for the PI, we'll return to the roadmaps module to see two effective ways for product managers, release managers, and RTEs to communicate delivery expectations by PI and release.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-111"><a id="_idTextAnchor113"/>PI roadmap</h2>
			<p>The program increment view roadmap<a id="_idIndexMarker334"/> displays PI cards based on the context set in the configuration bar. To access it, go to the navigation menu, select <strong class="bold">Program</strong> | <strong class="bold">Manage</strong> | <strong class="bold">Roadmaps</strong>, and then select <strong class="bold">Program Increments</strong> from the dropdown at the top left of the workspace. Be sure to set your context in the configuration bar.</p>
			<p>In the following screenshot, we have chosen the <code>Digital Services</code> portfolio and the following PIs: <code>PI-5</code>, <code>PI-6</code>, and <code>PI-7</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.31_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.31 – Jira Align roadmap program increment view"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.31 – Jira Align roadmap program increment view</p>
			<p>Note that PI end dates are shown as diamond shapes along the timeline. Each PI card displays a progress bar based on the percentage of accepted story points for the PI along with several configurable details sections. To configure the PI cards, click on the <strong class="bold">View Configuration</strong> button to access the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Photo</strong>: Slide this toggle on to display an image for each PI card. To upload an image, hover over the card and click on the <strong class="bold">Replace Image</strong> button.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dates</strong>: Slide this toggle on to display either internal, external, or program increment dates.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Cost &amp; value</strong>: Slide this toggle on to display estimated and actual costs for the PI.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Description</strong>: Slide this toggle on to display the PI description.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Highlights</strong>: Slide this toggle on to enable the selection of themes, portfolio epics, or features to appear in the highlights section. Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Highlight</strong> link on a PI card to select the work items you'd like to draw attention to in this section.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Objectives</strong>: Slide this toggle on to enable the selection of objectives to appear in the objectives section. Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Objectives</strong> link on a PI card to select the objectives you'd like to draw attention to in this section.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Show completed PIs</strong>: Slide this toggle on to display stats for completed PIs.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Having the <a id="_idIndexMarker335"/>preceding information readily available on a live roadmap helps program-level staff such as RTEs to obtain and share the real-time status on PI execution and provide targeted delivery highlights. We'll now look at a roadmap geared toward release management staff.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-112"><a id="_idTextAnchor114"/>Release vehicle roadmap</h2>
			<p>Release vehicles represent<a id="_idIndexMarker336"/> a set of features and/or stories released to actual customers. Releases can happen at any time following the agile practice of deploying continuously and releasing on demand. The release vehicle roadmap displays informative highlights based on the selected portfolio/programs and PIs. To access it, go to the navigation menu, select <code>Digital Services</code> portfolio and the following PIs: <code>PI-5</code>, <code>PI-6</code>, and <code>PI-7</code>:</p>
			<div><div><img src="img/Figure_6.32_B16328.jpg" alt="Figure 6.32 – Jira Align roadmap release vehicle view"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<p class="figure-caption">Figure 6.32 – Jira Align roadmap release vehicle view</p>
			<p>Note that release <a id="_idIndexMarker337"/>dates are shown as diamond shapes along the timeline. Each card displays a progress bar based on the percentage of accepted story points for the release vehicle, along with several configurable details sections. To configure the release vehicle cards, click on the <strong class="bold">View Configuration</strong> button to access the following options:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong class="bold">Dates</strong>: Slide this toggle on to display either internal, external, or program increment dates.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Program Increments</strong>: Slide this toggle on to display the program increment during which the release is shipped.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Highlights</strong>: Slide this toggle on to enable the selection of defects, stories, or features to appear in the highlights section. Click on the <strong class="bold">Add Highlight</strong> link on a release vehicle card to select the work items you'd like to draw attention to in this section.</li>
				<li><strong class="bold">Show completed</strong>: Slide this<a id="_idIndexMarker338"/> toggle on to show stats for completed release vehicles.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Having the preceding information readily available on a live roadmap helps program-level staff such as release managers to obtain and share real-time insights on release readiness and provide targeted delivery highlights.</p>
			<p>Congratulations, you've now learned how to build all varieties of roadmaps, from the work item roadmap at the start of the previous chapter to the PI and release vehicle roadmaps examined here. These, along with all that we learned in between, are sure to help you achieve alignment on all dimensions: people delivering work over periods of time to achieve outcomes.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-113"><a id="_idTextAnchor115"/>Summary</h1>
			<p>In this chapter, we learned how to overcome the execution challenges at the program level. We began by looking at the command center for execution, the program room. We then learned about the dependency workflow and how to handle external dependencies and use dependency maps. Lastly, we explored ways to reduce unnecessary work, manage scope, and communicate PI and release progress.</p>
			<p>In the next chapter, we will discuss common portfolio-level challenges, how <strong class="bold">lean portfolio management</strong> (<strong class="bold">LPM</strong>) shifts the mindset from project to product, and what it takes to connect business strategy with execution for organizational alignment.</p>
