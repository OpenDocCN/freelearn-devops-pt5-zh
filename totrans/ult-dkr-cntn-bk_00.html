<p>In today’s fast-paced world, developers are under constant pressure to build, modify, test, and deploy highly distributed applications quickly and efficiently. Operations engineers need a consistent deployment strategy that can handle their growing portfolio of applications, while stakeholders want to keep costs low. Docker containers, combined with a container orchestrator such as Kubernetes, provide a powerful solution to these challenges.</p>
<p>Docker containers streamline the process of building, shipping, and running highly distributed applications. They supercharge CI/CD pipelines and allow companies to standardize on a single deployment platform, such as Kubernetes. Containerized applications are more secure and can be run on any platform capable of running containers, whether on-premises or in the cloud. With Docker containers, developers, operations engineers, and stakeholders can achieve their goals and stay ahead of the curve.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor004"/>Who this book is for</h1>
<p>This book is designed for anyone who wants to learn about Docker and its capabilities. Whether you’re a system administrator, operations engineer, DevOps engineer, developer, or business stakeholder, this book will guide you through the process of getting started with Docker from scratch.</p>
<p>With clear explanations and practical examples, you’ll explore all the capabilities that this technology offers, ultimately providing you with the ability to deploy and run highly distributed applications in the cloud. If you’re looking to take your skills to the next level and harness the power of Docker, then this book is for you.</p>
<h1 id="_idParaDest-7"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>What this book covers</h1>
<p><a href="B19199_01.xhtml#_idTextAnchor012"><em class="italic">Chapter 1</em></a>, <em class="italic">What Are Containers and Why Should I Use Them?</em> focuses on the software supply chain and the friction within it. It then presents containers as a means to reduce this friction and add enterprise-grade security on top of it. In this chapter, we also look into how containers and the ecosystem around them are assembled. We specifically point out the distinction between the upstream OSS components (Moby) that form the building blocks of the downstream products of Docker and other vendors.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_02.xhtml#_idTextAnchor027"><em class="italic">Chapter 2</em></a>, <em class="italic">Setting Up a Working Environment</em>, discusses in detail how to set up an ideal environment for developers, DevOps, and operators that can be used when working with Docker containers.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_03.xhtml#_idTextAnchor057"><em class="italic">Chapter 3</em></a>, <em class="italic">Mastering Containers</em>, teaches you how to start, stop, and remove containers. This chapter also teaches you how to inspect containers to retrieve additional metadata from them. Furthermore, it explains how to run additional processes and how to attach to the main process in an already-running container. It also shows how to retrieve logging information from a container that is produced by the processes running inside it. Finally, the chapter introduces the inner workings of a container including such things as Linux namespaces and groups.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_04.xhtml#_idTextAnchor083"><em class="italic">Chapter 4</em></a>, <em class="italic">Creating and Managing Container Images</em>, presents different ways to create container images, which serve as templates for containers. It introduces the inner structure of an image and how it is built. This chapter also shows how to “lift and shift” an existing legacy application such that it runs in containers.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_05.xhtml#_idTextAnchor109"><em class="italic">Chapter 5</em></a>, <em class="italic">Data Volumes and Configuration</em><em class="italic">, </em>discusses data volumes, which can be used by stateful components running in containers. This chapter also shows how you can define individual environment variables for the application running inside the container, as well as how to use files containing whole sets of configuration settings.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_06.xhtml#_idTextAnchor130"><em class="italic">Chapter 6</em></a>, <em class="italic">Debugging Code Running in Containers</em>, introduces techniques commonly used to allow you to evolve, modify, debug, and test your code while running in a container. With these techniques at hand, you will enjoy a frictionless development process for applications running in a container, similar to what you experience when developing applications that run natively.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_07.xhtml#_idTextAnchor150"><em class="italic">Chapter 7</em></a>, <em class="italic">Testing </em><em class="italic">Applications</em><em class="italic"> Running in Containers</em>, discusses software testing for applications and application services running in containers. You will be introduced to the various test types that exist and understand how they can be optimally implemented and executed when using containers. The chapter explains how all tests can be run locally on a developer’s machine or as individual quality gates of a fully automated CI/CD pipeline.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_08.xhtml#_idTextAnchor174"><em class="italic">Chapter 8</em></a>, <em class="italic">Increasing Productivity with Docker Tips and Tricks</em>, shows miscellaneous tips, tricks, and concepts that are useful when containerizing complex distributed applications, or when using Docker to automate sophisticated tasks. You will also learn how to leverage containers to run your whole development environment in them.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_09.xhtml#_idTextAnchor194"><em class="italic">Chapter 9</em></a>, <em class="italic">Learning about Distributed Application Architecture</em>, introduces the concept of a distributed application architecture and discusses the various patterns and best practices that are required to run a distributed application successfully. Finally, it discusses the additional requirements that need to be fulfilled to run such an application in production.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_10.xhtml#_idTextAnchor218"><em class="italic">Chapter 10</em></a>, <em class="italic">Using Singl</em><em class="italic">e-H</em><em class="italic">ost Networking</em>, presents the Docker container networking model and its single host implementation in the form of the bridge network. The chapter introduces the concept of <strong class="bold">Software-Defined Networks</strong> (<strong class="bold">SDNs</strong>) and how they are used to secure containerized applications. It also covers how container ports can be opened to the public and thus make containerized components accessible from the outside world. Finally, it introduces Traefik, a reverse proxy, to enable sophisticated HTTP application-level routing between containers.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_11.xhtml#_idTextAnchor237"><em class="italic">Chapter 11</em></a>, <em class="italic">Managing Containers with Docker Compose</em>, introduces the concept of an application consisting of multiple services, each running in a container, and explains how Docker Compose allows us to easily build, run, and scale such an application using a declarative approach.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_12.xhtml#_idTextAnchor251"><em class="italic">Chapter 12</em></a>, <em class="italic">Shipping Logs and Monitoring Containers</em>, shows how the container logs can be collected and shipped to a central location where the aggregated log can then be parsed for useful information. You will also learn how to instrument an application so that it exposes metrics and how those metrics can be scraped and shipped again to a central location. Finally, the chapter teaches you how to convert those collected metrics into graphical dashboards that can be used to monitor a containerized application.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_13.xhtml#_idTextAnchor276"><em class="italic">Chapter 13</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Container Orchestration</em>, elaborates on the concept of container orchestrators. It explains why orchestrators are needed and how they conceptually work. The chapter will also provide an overview of the most popular orchestrators and name a few of their respective pros and cons.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_14.xhtml#_idTextAnchor303"><em class="italic">Chapter 14</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing</em><em class="italic"> Docker Swarm</em>, introduces Docker’s native orchestrator called SwarmKit. It elaborates on all the concepts and objects SwarmKit uses to deploy and run a distributed, resilient, robust, and highly available application in a cluster on-premises or in the cloud.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_15.xhtml#_idTextAnchor328"><em class="italic">Chapter 15</em></a>, <em class="italic">Deploying and Running a Distributed Application on Docker Swarm</em>, introduces routing mesh and demonstrates how to deploy a first application consisting of multiple services onto the Swarm.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_16.xhtml#_idTextAnchor349"><em class="italic">Chapter 16</em></a>, <em class="italic">Introducing Kubernetes</em>, presents the currently most popular container orchestrator, Kubernetes.

It also shows you how to instrument your application services with liveness and readiness probes, to support Kubernetes in its health and availability checking. Furthermore, the chapter explains how zero downtime deployments are achieved to enable disruption-free updates and rollbacks of mission-critical applications. Finally, it introduces Kubernetes Secrets as a means to configure services and protect sensitive data.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_18.xhtml#_idTextAnchor396"><em class="italic">Chapter 18</em></a>, <em class="italic">Running a Containerized Application in the Cloud</em>, gives an overview of some of the most popular ways of running containerized applications in the cloud. Fully managed offerings on Microsoft Azure, Amazon AWS, and Google Cloud Engine are discussed. We will create a hosted Kubernetes cluster on each cloud and deploy a simple distributed application to each of those clusters. We will also compare the ease of setup and use of the three offerings.</p>
<p><a href="B19199_19.xhtml#_idTextAnchor412"><em class="italic">Chapter 19</em></a>, <em class="italic">Monitoring and Troubleshooting an Application Running in Production</em>, covers different techniques used to instrument and monitor an individual service or a whole distributed application running on a Kubernetes cluster. You will be introduced to the concept of alerting based on key metrics.
