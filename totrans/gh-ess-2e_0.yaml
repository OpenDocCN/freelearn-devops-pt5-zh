- en: GitHub is the leading code-hosting platform with literally millions of open
    source projects having their code hosted on it. In conjunction with Git, it provides
    the means for a productive development workflow and is the preferred tool among
    developers.

    manage the issue tracker, where your project can be discussed. Continuing our
    journey, we will explore how to use the wiki and write rich documentation that
    will accompany your project. Organization and team management will be the next
    stop, and then the pull requests, which made GitHub so well known.

    we will explore the settings that are configurable for a user and a repository.

    Overview and Usage of the Issue Tracker*, explains some of the main features GitHub
    provides and what you can make out of them. The issue tracker is the heart of
    communication between a project''s developers and/or users. Consider it to be
    a notepad dedicated to each repository where you track bugs, reports, feature
    requests, and anything else that can be written down. GitHub has implemented many
    other features that sit on top of the issue tracker, such as labels and milestones,
    which provide the ability to better visualize and categorize all the issues.'

    maintain a wiki by providing a home for your documentation that will complement
    your project. You will also learn how to create a new release out of an existing
    branch or tag, accompanied by optional release notes. In this way, the end user

    the User and Repository Settings*, explores the most common and essential settings
    of a user and a repository. As a user, there is a lot of information you can set
    up in your user settings page, such as associating more than one email to your
    account, adding multiple SSH keys, or setting up two-factor authentication. Similarly,
    some functionalities of a repository can be set up via its settings page. For
    example, you can enable or disable the wiki pages and grant write access to the
    public, or completely disable the issue tracker.'
