            <article>
                
<p>With each update, a lot of new functionality, features, and enhancements are added in Dynamics 365. Some of these new features are targeted towards the end users who use the system on a daily basis, and others are for the administrators, customizers, or developers who are responsible for configuring, customizing, and developing solutions around it. In this chapter, we are going to look at some of these new features which we haven't covered in previous chapters.</p>

            <article>
                
<p>Web client refresh, which was introduced in the July 2017 update, is one of the biggest improvements made to the product, keeping in mind the feedback of the Dynamics 365 users related to the user interface. The user interface of the web client apps has been completely revamped, with the aim of making users working on the application more productive by increasing readability and accessibility.</p>
<p>Here are some of the major improvements in the web client:</p>
<ul>
<li>Containers, like sections, now have a defined border and any extra whitespace which is not part of any content has been gray shaded. Similarly, the main body is put inside the white container to separate it from the header and the rest of the content. Also, if the containers do not contain any data, it is clearly indicated using an icon and a message, as shown here in the activities list inside the social pane:</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f70eb732-b6f6-4e5d-9e1c-fb5a22cffb7c.png"/></div>
<ul>
<li>Text wrapping can now be configured for labels and values in the form. We need to go to <span class="packt_screen">System </span><span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">General</span> tab and Select <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> for the <span class="packt_screen">Allow text wrapping in form fields labels and values</span> option to enable it:</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="111" src="assets/cbe45f5a-41c4-4b3b-9c04-34166c5d876a.png" width="446"/></div>
<ul>
<li>This is how the fields are displayed in the form with text wrapping enabled:</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="144" src="assets/d9d71bdd-1659-4cf4-a00e-6bebe6865c6f.png" width="272"/></div>
<p>Styling changes include three new themes:</p>
<ul>
<li>CRM default theme</li>
<li>CRM blue theme</li>
<li>CRM orange theme</li>
</ul>
<p>Themes also include the option to define colors for the page header and the section header through the <span class="packt_screen">Page Header Fill Color</span> and the <span class="packt_screen">Panel Header Fill Color</span> property.</p>
<p>Here, we have specified the following values for those properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Page Header Fill Color</span> – <kbd>#ccffcc</kbd></li>
<li><span class="packt_screen">Panel Header Fill Color</span> – <kbd>#ccffff</kbd></li>
</ul>
<p>This is how the changes show up in the Dynamics 365 interface:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/f142afbc-25ad-4701-90ff-274629b9ef85.png"/></div>
<p>We now have the option to define a color for sub grid headers inside the form. Open the form for customization, select the sub grid and in the <span class="packt_screen">Edit properties</span> dialog box, we can specify <span class="packt_screen">Panel header color</span> as shown here:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="114" src="assets/cf44d563-e548-4305-91d9-8c586b4e741b.png" width="569"/></div>

            <article>
                
<p>The multiselect option set is now available as a new attribute type in Dynamics 365. These are some of the key features about this new attribute type:</p>
<ul>
<li>The multiselect option set can be used in advanced find</li>
<li>They are available for main forms, quick create and quick view forms</li>
<li>The existing global option set can be used for creating the multiselect option set attribute</li>
<li>The existing client side API's methods that are specific to the existing single valued option set applies to the new multiselect option set</li>
<li>The multiselect option set is not supported in business rules and workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>The following screenshot shows <span class="packt_screen">Multiselect</span> option set the field with three items selected <span class="packt_screen">Item 1</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Item2</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Item 3</span>:</p>

<p><span class="packt_screen">ADVANCED FIND</span> view now supports a <span class="packt_screen">Does Not Contain Data</span> filter for a related record. So basically, we can now write a query such as <kbd>Find all the lead records which do not contain any related tasks</kbd>. However, we cannot define any filter conditions for the related record in the current implementation as shown here:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="217" src="assets/3783177e-b8b5-456a-9ad3-909fd9338c63.png" width="508"/></div>
<p>This is how the <kbd>fetch</kbd> XML looks for the preceding query:</p>
<pre>    &lt;fetch version="1.0" output-format="xml-platform" mapping="logical" <br/>     distinct="true"&gt; 
      &lt;entity name="lead"&gt; 
        &lt;attribute name="fullname" /&gt; 
        &lt;attribute name="companyname" /&gt; 
        &lt;attribute name="telephone1" /&gt; 
        &lt;attribute name="leadid" /&gt; 
        &lt;order attribute="fullname" descending="false" /&gt; 
        &lt;link-entity name="task" from="regardingobjectid" to="leadid"<br/>         link-type="outer" alias="ac" /&gt; 
        &lt;filter type="and"&gt; 
          &lt;condition entityname="ac" attribute="regardingobjectid" operator="null" /&gt; 
        &lt;/filter&gt; 
      &lt;/entity&gt; 
    &lt;/fetch&gt; </pre>

<p>For JavaScript and HTML web resource, we can now specify dependencies. This makes sure that all the required dependent resources are available in the solution during export, or already existing in the target system to which the solution is being imported, otherwise it will result in failure. It also ensures that we do not delete any of the components accidentally without removing its dependencies first. For HTML and JavaScript, we can define dependencies on other web resource types such as CSS, HTML, JavaScript libraries, RESX and XML. In case of JavaScript, we can additionally define dependencies on attributes of a specific entity as shown here:</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Understanding the new unified interface</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Unified interface is a new framework introduced in the Dynamics 365 July 2017 update. With unified interface, we now have the same architecture under the hood across all the platforms. Currently, we have the following apps such as <span class="packt_screen">Customer Service Hub</span> (which is a new version of <span class="packt_screen">Interactive Service Hub</span>), <span class="packt_screen">Field Resource Hub</span>, <span class="packt_screen">Project Resource Hub</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">Sales Hub</span> developed on unified interface as shown here:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/d08963eb-169c-4d27-ba3b-e5abc184514b.png"/></div>
<p>The unified interface has been built from the ground up keeping accessibility, consistency and performance in mind. It also brings faster development and deployment time, with a single set of customizations working seamlessly across different devices. For the end users, it will provide a uniform experience across tablet/phone client, mobile web client or App for Outlook which makes it more consistent, user-friendly and saves training costs.</p>
<p>Benefits of the new unified interface include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy access to favorite and recent records, dashboards and entities within the application at a single place from the left navigation panel:</li>
</ul>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/e28d0e12-6f1a-46ad-b224-0e6a9dd4448e.png" style="text-align: center;color: black;font-size: 1em"/></div>
<ul>
<li>Recently used records inside the unified interface can be pinned, as shown here:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The new responsive user interface of the unified client, autofits based on the screen size. On resizing the browser window, the unified interface displays an interface that fits the small screen, as shown here on the image on the right:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Business process flows can now be displayed in floating mode along with docked mode:</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>New timeline control in the unified interface combines and gives a single view of all the activities, notes and posts, which can be filtered by record type, date and so on. It also allows the user to perform various actions based on the type of record as shown here:</li>
</ul>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Integrating external data using virtual entity</h1>
                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>With the July 2017 update in Dynamics 365, we can now create a virtual type of custom entity. The name virtual applies because the data for the entity is not saved inside Dynamics 365. The virtual entity on runtime, that is when accessed, gets its data from the data source provider configured for it. Currently, it <span>only </span>supports the OData V4 data provider. With an earlier version of Dynamics 365, before virtual entity, if we had to fetch or retrieve data from external data sources, we had to write custom code for that. Now, once we have the OData service ready and exposed, it becomes more of a configuration thing inside Dynamics 365, that the system administrator or customizer can take care of, without depending on the developer.</p>
<p>To configure a virtual entity:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> and select <span class="packt_screen">Virtual Entity Data Sources</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/61ae2100-2232-48df-8f5c-6d86ad35acdb.png" style="text-align: center;color: black;font-size: 1em"/></div>
<ol start="2">
<li>Click on <span class="packt_screen">New</span> to create a new data source. Currently, it supports only <span class="packt_screen">OData V4 Data Provider</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="182" src="assets/b9580d5f-8499-424d-9530-4021fbbe555f.png" style="text-align: center;color: black;font-size: 1em" width="485"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Specify the URL of the OData service, along with the required values to create the OData source record:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="287" src="assets/fb9d172a-11b6-4d42-a8f6-bea6066fc107.png" style="text-align: center;color: black;font-size: 1em" width="262"/></div>
<ol start="4">
<li>Now with the data source setup, the next step is to create the virtual entity. Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Customizations</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Customize the System</span> | Select <span class="packt_screen">Entities</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">New</span> to create a new entity. To create a virtual entity, we need to select the <span class="packt_screen">Virtual Entity</span> checkbox.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="5">
<li>For a virtual entity, the <span class="packt_screen">External Name</span> property and the <span class="packt_screen">External Collection Name</span> property should correspond to the entity name and the entity set name within the OData entity to which we want to configure inside Dynamics 365:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/3eceea9b-7fe1-4f25-8104-e37eb47fba11.png"/></div>
<div class="packt_infobox" style="padding-left: 60px">To learn more about OData go to the following link:<br/>
<a href="http://www.odata.org/documentation/">http://www.odata.org/documentation/</a></div>
<ol start="6">
<li>On creation of a virtual entity, two fields will be created by the system, which need to be mapped to the corresponding fields of the OData entity as part of the virtual entity configuration. Apart from the autocreated fields, we can also create new custom fields and can then map them to the corresponding fields of the OData entity for them to show up inside Dynamics 365.</li>
<li>Here, we are mapping the ID field created for the virtual entity with the primary key field (for example, <kbd>EntityID</kbd>) of our OData Entity. The primary key field must be of type GUID, otherwise we will get an exception:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="249" src="assets/1d84ddff-24c2-40b3-a450-8c4917fb82ce.png" style="text-align: center;color: black;font-size: 1em" width="351"/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Once we are done with creating and mapping all the fields of the virtual entity, we can publish the changes.</li>
<li>This virtual entity will be available just like any other entity. We can open the <span class="packt_screen">ADVANCED FIND</span> view, select the virtual entity and run the query against it or open any of the records created for that entity to view it.</li>
<li>Here are certain points we need to consider while planning to use a virtual entity:
<ul>
<li>A virtual entity is read-only</li>
<li>A virtual entity is organization owned, however, the Dynamics 365 security features are not supported for a virtual entity</li>
<li>A virtual entity cannot be of type Activity</li>
<li>We cannot configure SLAs, business process flows against the virtual entity</li>
<li>A virtual entity doesn't support the creation of a quick create form</li>
<li>We cannot enable auditing and duplicate detection on them</li>
<li>Virtual entity fields cannot be used for rollups and calculated fields</li>
<li>Although we can use it inside an advanced find, Microsoft doesn't recommend using a query that joins the Dynamics 365 native data with virtual entity data</li>
<li>We cannot write workflow or plugins against a virtual entity</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

                </header>

<p>Auto numbering as a feature, has always been there in the Dynamics 365 starting version 3.0, but it has always been restricted to a few entities such as contracts, cases, articles, quotes, and so on.</p>
<p>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Auto-Numbering</span> to see all the entities on which we can configure auto numbering:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="291" src="assets/5cc09e29-aca5-42d7-8f20-edd733dff2dc.png" width="536"/></div>
<p>However, now with the Dynamics 365 July 2017 update, we finally have the ability to define autonumbering for other entities as well. Currently, we can only define it programatically using SDK's <kbd>CreateAttribute</kbd> request. We do not have the user interface to define it.</p>
<p>Here is the sample code that will create a new auto number field name,<br/>
<kbd>My Auto Number</kbd> in the contact entity:</p>
<pre>    CreateAttributeRequest createAttributeRequest = new CreateAttributeRequest(); 
    createAttributeRequest.EntityName = "contact"; 
 
    var autoNumberAttributeMetadata = new StringAttributeMetadata() 
    { 
      AutoNumberFormat = "Auto Number - {SEQNUM:4} - {RANDSTRING:4} - <br/>       {DATETIMEUTC:yyyyMMddhhmmss}", 
      SchemaName = "new_autonumber1", 
      MaxLength = 100, 
      RequiredLevel = new AttributeRequiredLevelManagedProperty(<br/>       AttributeRequiredLevel.ApplicationRequired), 
      DisplayName = new Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Label("My Auto Number", 1033), 
      Description = new Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Label("This is my first auto number<br/>       field through SDK", 1033) 
    }; 
 
    createAttributeRequest.Attribute = autoNumberAttributeMetadata; 
    var response = organizationService.Execute(createAttributeRequest); </pre>
<p>The following image shows the auto number field generated with the format specified for a contact record:</p>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="108" src="assets/040c2c8a-9378-4dd2-8d73-295485010e8f.png" width="332"/></div>

                </header>

<p>Relevance Search brings the power of Microsoft's Azure Search to improve search performance in Dynamics 365. Data from the Dynamics 365 entities and the fields enabled for Relevance Search are synced with Azure Search DB, which performs an intuitive semantic search on it, and displays the results by relevance. Relevance Search searches across the fields in the entities and displays the results in the order of the most relevant to the least, unlike a categorized search, which displays results based on entity grouping. Also, compared to a categorized search which is limited to filtering the result by entity, the Relevance Search lets the Dynamics 365 user filter the result based on multiple conditions such as record type, owner, modified on, created on and any other filtering option defined for each of the entities, based on facets. As Relevance Search uses a semantic search, we do not need to specify a wild card in our search text. Relevance Search also highlights the matching words in the search results. Basically, once we have identified and configured the entities and their corresponding fields for Relevance Search, the full sync can take more than an hour, depending on the amount of data to be synced, when it runs the first time and then any subsequent changes made in Dynamics 365 can take up to 15 minutes to appear in the search.</p>

<p>To enable Relevance Search:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Administration</span> | <span class="packt_screen">System Settings</span>. In the <span class="packt_screen">General</span> tab, check the <span class="packt_screen">Enable Relevance Search</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Set up Search</span> section and give the consent to share the data with the external system:</li>

<ol start="2">
<li>Next, we need to define entities and fields on which we want the Relevance Search to be performed. Go to <span class="packt_screen">Customizations</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Entities</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Configure Relevance Search</span> to select the entities on which we need to enable the Relevance Search:</li>

<li>There is no limit on the number of entities that can be selected for the Relevance Search. The limitation is on the number of fields per organization, the maximum is 1,000 fields. Here, the lookup field is considered equivalent of adding 3 fields, option set as 2 and remaining fields as 1 field.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>We can add the entities from the <span class="packt_screen">Available Entities</span> list box to the <span class="packt_screen">Selected Entities</span> list box, followed by publish.

<li>To enable a particular attribute of an entity for the Relevance Search, we need to add the field as <span class="packt_screen">Find columns</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Quick Find</span> view of that entity. Only a single line of text and multiple lines of text will be searchable.</li>
<li>The first four fields defined in the <span class="packt_screen">Quick Find</span> view will be displayed in the search results in the user interface.</li>
<li>Similarly, the first four facetable fields, that is fields of data types other than a single line of text or multiple lines of text, in the <span class="packt_screen">Quick Find</span> view will be displayed as facets in the Relevance Search user interface.</li>
<li>The filter defined on the <span class="packt_screen">Quick Find</span> view is also applied to the Relevance Search results. However, not all the operators are supported for filtering. The following is the list of the operators that aren't supported by Relevance Search:</li>

<p>The Data Export Service can be defined as a scalable and secure cloud service that enables the replication of the Dynamics 365 online database into a Microsoft Azure SQL database or a SQL database on Microsoft Azure virtual machines. This Dynamics 365 data that can then be queried and used for various analytics and reporting scenarios such as Power BI or SQL-based SSRS reports, or to build any custom solutions on top of it. The Data Export Service synchronizes the entire Dynamics 365 data based on the export profile defined, for the first time and then on the subsequent run, it only synchronizes the delta changes to it.</p>

<p>To configure Data Export Service:</p>
<ol>
<li>We need to first link Office 365 Tenant with the Azure Subscription (in case they are separate), see <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-office-365-tenant-to-azure-subscription">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/billing/billing-add-office-365-tenant-to-azure-subscription</a>.</span></li>
<li>Next, we create an Azure SQL database. For this, sign in to the Azure portal and click on <span class="packt_screen">Add</span> to create a new SQL database: <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-get-started-portal">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-get-started-portal</a></span>.<span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-get-started-portal"/></span></li>
<li>After successful creation of the Azure SQL database, open the SQL Server Management Studio to connect to the Azure SQL database. We can get the server name from the Azure portal and set the firewall rule that will allow us to connect to the Azure SQL database from SQL Server Management Studio:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
<li>Next, we need to create an SQL user that will be used by Data Export Service to write data inside the Azure database. For this first one, create a login, with master database selected:</li>
</ol>
<pre>      Create login [dataexportserviceuser] with PASSWORD = '**********';  </pre>
<ol start="5">
<li>Assign a db owner role to the user on the Azure SQL database that you created to be used for exporting Dynamics 365 data:</li>

<p>Relationship Insights leverages Microsoft Azure's machine learning capabilities to analyze information in Dynamics 365, Exchange and Office 365 and guide users to help them build more personalized and productive relationships with their customers. All the insights captured from these sources are displayed inside Dynamics 365, so the users will never have to leave Dynamics 365 and shuffle between different applications to figure out the next business activities they need to take.</p>
<p>The three key features of Relationship Insights are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Relationship Assistant</li>
<li>Email Engagement</li>
<li>Auto Capture</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_infobox">Relationship Insights is still in preview, the feature is only available in the <strong>North America</strong> (<strong>NA</strong>) region.</div>

<p>There are two ways we can enable and configure Relationship Assistant: from <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Relationship Insights</span> or from <span class="packt_screen">Personal Options</span> settings. Relationship Assistant analyzes all the communications regarding the customer records the user is working on and generates the action cards. These action cards remind users of the actions to be performed such as emails to be sent today, reminding users about the opportunity of having close data approaching, or show analytics related to when an email or attachment is opened, or notifications about the account, case, contact and so on, record having no associated activity. The action cards are divided into the different categories as shown here:</p>

<div class="packt_infobox"><span class="packt_screen">Email Cards from Exchange</span> requires <span class="packt_screen">Exchange Online</span> to be configured.</div>
<p>Action cards can be viewed within the <span class="packt_screen">ASSISTANT</span> tab in the social pane inside the form. The <span class="packt_screen">Relationship Assistant</span> can also be added as one of the components inside the dashboard. The sample action card shown here, reminds the user of an opportunity closing within 14 days inside an opportunity form. The user can open the opportunity record from with in the action card and can work on it:</p>

<p>Following are the steps to configure the Auto Capture:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Relationship Insights</span>, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Auto Capture</span> tab to turn it on.</li>
<li>Auto Capture requires server-side synchronization and <span class="packt_screen">Exchange Online</span> to be configured.</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_infobox" style="padding-left: 60px">Set up server-side synchronization: <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn531109.aspx">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn531109.aspx</a>.</span></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>Auto Capture analyzes the email communication done through <span class="packt_screen">Exchange Online</span> and displays relevant emails inside Dynamics 365 for tracking. Currently, these emails are private, which means they are only visible to the current user.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="4">
<li>Here is how the mail sent to a contact from Exchange shows up in the <span class="packt_screen">ACTIVITIES</span> tab of the social pane inside Dynamics 365:</li>

<ol start="5">
<li>The user can click on <span class="packt_screen">TRACK</span> to track the activity inside Dynamics 365. The status changes from <span class="packt_screen">Not Tracked</span> to <span class="packt_screen">Tracking Pending</span>. After server side synchronizing finishes, (within 15 minutes), the mail starts getting tracked inside Dynamics 365:</li>

<ol start="6">
<li>Auto Capture, once turned on, will be enabled for all the users in that particular Dynamics 365 instance. The user can turn if off by going to the gear icon, open <span class="packt_screen">Personal Options</span>, select the <span class="packt_screen">Email</span> tab and select <span class="packt_screen">No</span> for <span class="packt_screen">Show email not tracked in Dynamics 365</span> in the <span class="packt_screen">Activities</span> list option.</li>

<p>Following are the steps to configure Email Engagement:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Relationship Insights</span>, select the <span class="packt_screen">&gt;Email Engagement</span> tab and click on <span class="packt_screen">Begin Setup</span>.

<li>Email Engagement provides insights around email communication such as whether an email or the attachments have been opened or not, whether a link has been clicked or not, suggesting the best time to send email based upon the open rates and so on.</li>
<li>After SharePoint integration is configured we need to enable document management for the Email entity; go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Document Management</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Document Management Settings</span> and check the <span class="packt_screen">Email</span> checkbox. This is required if we want to follow attachments along with the email activity.</li>
<li>Email Engagement works only on email sent from inside Dynamics 365. To see it in action, create an email activity. You will notice a new section named Email Engagement in the email activity's form. By default, the emails created are followed. To unfollow it, we need to click on the <span class="packt_screen">DON'T FOLLOW</span> link:</li>

                </header>
            
            <article>
                
<p>Using Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms, we can seamlessly synchronize LinkedIn leads from LinkedIn's Lead Gen Forms inside Dynamics 365. These leads can then be nurtured inside Dynamics 365.</p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Setting up LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms: <span class="URLPACKT"><a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising/lead-gen-ads">https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/native-advertising/lead-gen-ads</a>.</span></div>
<p>To configure it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">Dynamics Marketplace</span>, search for <kbd>Dynamics 365 Connector for LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms</kbd> to install it. Click on <span class="packt_screen">Free Trial</span> and follow the instructions to start the installations process.</li>
<li>Inside the LinkedIn <span class="packt_screen">Organization Selector</span> page that shows up, select the <span class="packt_screen">Organization</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">Continue</span> to start the setup:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/1ae32a6c-11f2-4a67-a2fb-15297e5ecdf4.png"/></div>
<ol start="3">
<li>We will receive a confirmation email when the setup completes successfully. This installs the <kbd>LinkedInLeadGenIntegration</kbd> solution inside Dynamics 365.</li>
<li>Whenever a new lead is synced from LinkedIn, Dynamics 365 looks for the <span class="packt_screen">Matching Lead Fields</span> defined in the active <span class="packt_screen">LINKEDIN LEAD MATCHING STRATEGY</span> record to determine whether to create a new lead or update an existing lead record inside Dynamics 365.</li>
<li>LinkedIn Leads are created as LinkedIn Form Submissions records inside Dynamics 365. They contain the answers provided by the LinkedIn Member during the submission of the form. The existing lead records are matched with these answers based on the field defined as matching fields.</li>
</ol>
<ol start="6">
<li>A user with a LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms Connector Administrator security role can define the <span class="packt_screen">Email Lead Matching Strategy</span>. Here is the default record created inside Dynamics 365, having matching fields defined on email address:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8f0a83e3-dada-48ed-8a9d-da27e440970f.png"/></div>
<ol start="7">
<li>At any given point of time only one strategy can be activated. If more than one field is defined then all the fields should match for an existing lead record to be updated. If only subsets of fields match, then we can configure whether a new lead record should be created or no action is to be taken, in the <span class="packt_screen">On Matching Fail</span> property of the <span class="packt_screen">LinkedIn LeadGen Integration Configuration</span> record:</li>
</ol>
<div class="mce-root CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img height="50" src="assets/3c734ba2-7917-449e-acca-7d68b6e043e2.png" style="color: black;font-size: 1em" width="227"/></div>
<ol start="8">
<li>Next, we need to authorize Dynamics 365 to sync data from LinkedIn's Campaign Manager. Go to <span class="packt_screen">Settings</span> | <span class="packt_screen">LinkedIn User Profile</span> and click on <span class="packt_screen">New</span> to create a new user profile record. To add a linkedIn account to this new user profile, click on the <span class="packt_screen">Authorize</span> button. Enter the LinkedIn account credentials and select <span class="packt_screen">Allow</span>:</li>
</ol>
<div class="packt_figure CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign" style="color: black;font-size: 1em"><img height="297" src="assets/ba524647-0e54-4e99-98e4-e4d1c5af7c66.png" width="519"/></div>
<ol start="9">
<li>Select <span class="packt_screen">Yes</span> to allow Dynamics 365 to access LinkedIn data in the next screen that shows up.</li>
<li>This adds the LinkedIn account to the profile and starts the sync. We can also click on the <span class="packt_screen">Sync Submissions</span> button to start the sync manually. This will start synching LinkedIn Form Submissions records with Dynamics 365:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="11">
<li>Inside Dynamics 365, we can open the lead record inside Dynamics 365 and see the details captured in the <span class="packt_screen">LinkedIn Lead Info</span> section as shown here:</li>
