    businesses now look at technology as an opportunity to do more business. The use
    of sophisticated software systems for critical decision making is increasing more
    than ever before. Pioneering companies have already realized the benefits of tapping
    into a digital ecosystem and are leveraging technology as a differentiator. To
    keep pace with the changes in the marketplace, software systems need to change
    too.

    known as the Process Template) is used to orchestrate the delivery framework terminology
    and workflow. While TFS comes preloaded with the Scrum, Agile, and CMMI Process
    Templates, TFS supports customizing existing process and creating new process

    you to add new items, prioritize items, visualize the relationship between different
    Backlog Items, and see the state of the existing Backlog Items. It is now possible

- en: Work Items are used for capturing, planning, and tracking work in TFS. The **History**
    tab in a Work Item provides a full audit trail of the changes done to that Work
    Item. It is not uncommon to create a Work Item that you later decide is not needed.
    A Work Item can be excluded from the backlog by changing the Work Item state to
    **Removed**; however, the Work Item isn't deleted. As it stands today, there is
    no provision to permanently delete a Work Item from the user interface. In this
    recipe, you'll learn how to use the `witadmin` command line utility to permanently
    delete a Work Item and all history associated to it from TFS.

    not need to be provided; the `/collection` switch is used to specify the Team
    Foundation Collection the Work Item belongs to. The `/id` switch is used to specify
    one or more Work Item IDs. The `/noprompt` switch can be optionally used to disable
    the prompt for confirmation.
